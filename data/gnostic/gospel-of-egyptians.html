<h1>The Gospel of the Egyptians</h1>
<p><em>An early Christian text surviving only in fragments</em></p>

<h2>About This Text</h2>
<p>The Gospel of the Egyptians was an early Christian gospel likely written in the 2nd century, probably in Egypt. It is known only from a handful of quotations by Clement of Alexandria and other church fathers. The full text has been lost.</p>

<p>This gospel should not be confused with the Coptic "Holy Book of the Great Invisible Spirit" (also called "Gospel of the Egyptians") found in the Nag Hammadi library, which is a completely different Sethian Gnostic text.</p>

<h2>Surviving Fragments</h2>

<h3>Fragment 1 - Dialogue with Salome</h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Clement of Alexandria, Stromateis 3.9.63-64</p>
<blockquote>
When Salome asked, "How long will death have power?" the Lord answered: "As long as you women bear children."
</blockquote>
<p>Salome said: "Then I have done well in not bearing children."</p>
<p>The Lord answered: "Eat every plant, but do not eat that which has bitterness."</p>

<h3>Fragment 2 - On Male and Female</h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Clement of Alexandria, Stromateis 3.13.92</p>
<blockquote>
When Salome asked when what she had inquired about would be known, the Lord said: "When you have trampled on the garment of shame and when the two become one and the male with the female is neither male nor female."
</blockquote>

<h3>Fragment 3 - The Kingdom</h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Clement of Alexandria, Stromateis 3.9.64</p>
<blockquote>
"I have come to destroy the works of the female."
</blockquote>
<p><em>Note: Clement interprets "female" as referring to desire/passion, not women.</em></p>

<h3>Fragment 4 - Another Version</h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> 2 Clement 12:2 (possibly quoting this gospel)</p>
<blockquote>
"When the Lord himself was asked by someone when his kingdom would come, he said: 'When the two shall be one, and the outside as the inside, and the male with the female neither male nor female.'"
</blockquote>

<h2>Distinctive Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Encratite Themes:</strong> The gospel appears to promote sexual continence and celibacy</li>
<li><strong>Salome as Interlocutor:</strong> The woman Salome is the primary questioner</li>
<li><strong>Unity of Opposites:</strong> Teaching that male and female must become one</li>
<li><strong>Anti-Procreation:</strong> Childbearing is associated with death's power</li>
</ul>

<h2>Theological Interpretation</h2>
<p>Clement of Alexandria quotes this gospel but interprets it spiritually rather than literally:</p>
<ul>
<li>"The female" represents passion and desire, not women</li>
<li>"Male and female becoming one" refers to the soul rising above passion</li>
<li>The teaching is about spiritual purity, not physical abstinence</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the Encratites (a celibate Christian sect) interpreted these sayings literally to support their rejection of marriage and procreation.</p>

<h2>Historical Context</h2>
<p>Church fathers who mention this gospel:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clement of Alexandria</strong> (c. 150-215) - Primary source of quotations</li>
<li><strong>Hippolytus</strong> (c. 170-235) - Mentions Encratites used it</li>
<li><strong>Epiphanius</strong> (c. 310-403) - Notes it was used by various groups</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship to Other Texts</h2>
<p>The themes in the Gospel of the Egyptians have parallels in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gospel of Thomas (saying 22 on male/female becoming one)</li>
<li>Gospel of Philip (bridal chamber theology)</li>
<li>2 Clement (early Christian writing)</li>
</ul>

<p>These parallels suggest a common tradition about the overcoming of gender division in salvation.</p>

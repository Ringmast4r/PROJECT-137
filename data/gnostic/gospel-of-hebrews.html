<h1>The Gospel of the Hebrews</h1>
<p><em>A lost Jewish-Christian gospel preserved only in fragments</em></p>

<h2>About This Text</h2>
<p>The Gospel of the Hebrews was a Jewish-Christian gospel written in Greek, likely in Egypt during the first half of the 2nd century. The complete text is lost - only about 7-8 fragments survive as quotations by early Church Fathers.</p>

<p>According to the church historian Nicephorus (9th century), the Gospel of the Hebrews contained 2,200 lines - only 300 fewer than the Gospel of Matthew.</p>

<h2>Surviving Fragments</h2>

<h3>Fragment 1 - The Holy Spirit as Mother</h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Origen, Commentary on John 2.12.87</p>
<blockquote>
"Even so did my mother, the Holy Spirit, take me by one of my hairs and carry me away to the great mountain Tabor."
</blockquote>
<p><em>Note: This portrays the Holy Spirit as Jesus' divine Mother, a distinctive feature of this gospel.</em></p>

<h3>Fragment 2 - Baptism of Jesus</h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Jerome, Commentary on Isaiah 4</p>
<blockquote>
"And it came to pass when the Lord was come up out of the water, the whole fount of the Holy Spirit descended upon him and rested on him and said to him: My Son, in all the prophets was I waiting for thee that thou shouldest come and I might rest in thee. For thou art my rest; thou art my first-begotten Son that reignest for ever."
</blockquote>

<h3>Fragment 3 - First Appearance to James</h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Jerome, De viris illustribus 2</p>
<blockquote>
"And when the Lord had given the linen cloth to the servant of the priest, he went to James and appeared to him. For James had sworn that he would not eat bread from that hour in which he had drunk the cup of the Lord until he should see him risen from among them that sleep. And shortly thereafter the Lord said: Bring a table and bread! And immediately it is added: he took the bread, blessed it and brake it and gave it to James the Just and said to him: My brother, eat thy bread, for the Son of man is risen from among them that sleep."
</blockquote>
<p><em>Note: This places James as the first witness to the resurrection, showing the high esteem this community held for James the brother of Jesus.</em></p>

<h3>Fragment 4 - On Forgiveness</h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Jerome, Against Pelagius 3.2</p>
<blockquote>
"If thy brother has sinned by a word and made thee amends, receive him seven times in a day. Simon his disciple said unto him: Seven times in a day? The Lord answered and said unto him: Yea, I say unto thee, until seventy times seven times. For in the prophets also, after they were anointed with the Holy Spirit, the word of sin was found."
</blockquote>

<h3>Fragment 5 - The Sin Against the Holy Spirit</h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Origen, Homily on Jeremiah 15.4</p>
<blockquote>
"He that has sinned against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but he that has sinned against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world nor in that which is to come."
</blockquote>

<h3>Fragment 6 - Pre-existence of Christ</h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Cyril of Jerusalem, Discourse on Mary Theotokos 12a</p>
<blockquote>
"When Christ wished to come upon the earth to men, the good Father summoned a mighty power in heaven, which was called Michael, and entrusted Christ to the care thereof."
</blockquote>

<h3>Fragment 7 - The Rich Man</h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Origen, Commentary on Matthew 15.14</p>
<blockquote>
"The second of the rich men said unto him: Master, what good thing can I do and live? He said unto him: Man, fulfil the law and the prophets. He answered him: I have kept them. He said unto him: Go, sell all that thou ownest and distribute it unto the poor, and come, follow me. But the rich man began to scratch his head, and it pleased him not. And the Lord said unto him: How sayest thou, I have kept the law and the prophets? For it is written in the law, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself; and behold, many of thy brethren, sons of Abraham, are clad with dung, dying for hunger, and thy house is full of much goods, and there goeth out therefrom nought at all unto them."
</blockquote>

<h2>Distinctive Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Holy Spirit as Mother:</strong> Unique portrayal of the Holy Spirit as the divine feminine/mother</li>
<li><strong>James the Just:</strong> High regard for James, brother of Jesus, as leader of the Jerusalem church</li>
<li><strong>Jewish Christianity:</strong> Reflects a community that maintained Jewish observances while following Jesus</li>
<li><strong>Egyptian Origin:</strong> Likely composed in Alexandria, Egypt</li>
</ul>

<h2>Historical Context</h2>
<p>The Gospel of the Hebrews is mentioned by several early Church Fathers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clement of Alexandria (c. 150-215)</li>
<li>Origen (c. 185-254)</li>
<li>Eusebius (c. 260-340)</li>
<li>Jerome (c. 347-420)</li>
</ul>

<p>Jerome believed it was the original Hebrew version of Matthew's Gospel, though modern scholars recognize it as a distinct work. It was used by Jewish Christians in Egypt and possibly by the Ebionites.</p>

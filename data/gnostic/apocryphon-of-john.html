            The teaching [of the Savi]or and the re[vel]ation of the mysteries 
            [together with the things] hidden in silence a[nd those (things) w]hich he 
            taught to Joh[n, his dis]ciple.</span></p>

          <b><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">2</span></b><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> 
            [Now] it happened one [d]ay when John [the brother] of James, the so[n]s 
            of Ze[bed]ee, was going up to the temple, a [Pha]risee named Arimanios [appr]oached 
            him. And he said to him, &quot;Where is your teacher, the one whom you used to 
            follow?&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I [said] to him, &quot;He returned 
            to the pla[ce] from which he came.&quot; The Pharisee [said to me, &quot;This 
            Nazorene] deceived you (pl.) with error. He filled [your (pl.) ears with 
            lies], and he shut [your hearts. He turned you (pl.)] from the tradi[tions 
            of your fathers.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">When I, John,] heard] these 
            things, [I turned] from the temp[le to a mountainous and desert place] and 
            I grieved [greatly in my heart, asking] &quot;How [was the Savior appointed?&quot;] 
            and &quot;Why was he sent [into the world] by h[is father? Who is his] father 
            who [sent him? And of what sort] is [that] aeon [to which we will go?] For 
            what did he slay about it? He told us] that the aeon to which [we will go 
            is mo]deled on the [indestructible] aeon, [but he did not tea]ch us abou[t 
            what sort] the latter is.]&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          <b><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">3</span></b><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> 
            Just th[en, while I was thinking these things, behold the [heavens opened, 
            and] the [whole] crea[tion] below the heaven [was] illumi­nated. And [the 
            world] quaked.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">[I] was [afraid and behold] in 
            the light [I] saw [a child stand]ing by me. When I sa[w him, he becam] e 
            like an old person and he shifted hi]s semblance, becoming like a servant. 
            These (semblances) before me were not multiple beings but there was only a 
            (single) [li]keness [having] many forms in the lig[ht]. And the 
            [semblances] appeared through each other, a[nd] the [semblan]ce had three 
            forms. </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">[He] said to me, &quot;John, Jo[h]n, 
            why do you doubt and why [are you] fearful? Are [you] are a stranger to 
            this likeness?—This is to say, do not [be] faint[hea]rted! I am the one 
            who [dwells with you (pl.)] al­ways. I [am the Father. I am] the Mother. I 
            am the So[n]. I am the one who is undefiled and unpolluted.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          [Now I have come to teach] you what exists [and what has come into being 
          an]d what must [come into being so that you will under­stand the] things 
          which are not apparent [and those which are appar­ent, and to teach] you 
          about the [immovable] genera[tion of] the perfe[ct Human.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          N]ow [then lift up] your [face so that] you will [receive] the things that 
          [I will teach you] today [and you will tell them to your fellow] spirits 
          who c[ome from the immovable] generation of the perfect Hu­man.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          <b>4 </b>And [I asked so that I might [know.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And he said] to me, &quot;The Monad [is a mo]narch[y with]out any­thing 
          existing over it. [It exists as the God] and Father of the [A]ll., the [invisi]ble 
          which dwells above [the All, ...] imperishableness which exi[sts as the] 
          pure light upon which it is not possible for any eye to] gaze.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          [It is the] invisible [Spirit], and It is not appropriate [to consider It] 
          to be like the g[o]ds or that It is something similar. For It is more than 
          divine, [without anything] existing over It. For nothing lords [over It].</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          [. . .] not [...] in an[yth]ing less [... exists in It.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          It alone [is eternal] since It does not need [anything.] For It is totally 
          perfect. [It] does not [lack] anything such that [anything] would perfect 
          It, [but] It is [al]ways completely perfect in [light]. It can­not be [limi]ted 
          because there is nothing [before It] to limit It. [It is] inscrut[able 
          because there] is no one who exists before It [to scrutinine It.] [It is 
          im]measurable because there is nothing [which exists before It to measure] 
          It. [It is] in[visible because there is] no one to see [It. It is an 
          eternity existing] eternally. [It is ineffable because] there is no one 
          able to comprehend It in order to sp[eak about It.] It is [un]nameable 
          because [there is no one before It] to name [It.] It is [the immeasurable 
          light,] which is pure, [holy, and unpolluted. It is in]effable [being 
          perfect i]n incorruptibility. (It does) [not] (exist) in per[fection], 
          blessed[ness, or] divini[ty] but It is [far] supe­rior (to these).</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          It is neither corporeal [nor in]corporeal. [It] is not large or small. [It 
          is not] such that one could [say] that It has quantity or [quality]. For 
          it is not possible for anyone [to know It]. It is not something among 
          [existing things, but It is] far [super]ior—[not] as [being supe­rior] (to 
          others as though It is comparable to them) but as that which belongs to 
          Itself. It does [not partici]pate in the aeons or in time (as a 
          constitutive part of them). For that which participates i[n an aeon] was 
          first prepared (by others). It was [not given a p]ortion in time [because] 
          It does not receive anything [from anoth]er- for [what­ever] It received 
          would be received as a loan. For what exists prior] to anything else is 
          not deficient such that It should receive [from any­thing].</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          For this one gazes marveling at Itself [alone] in Its light. [...] For It 
          is a vastness. [It possesses the immeasurable [simpli]city. [It is] an 
          aeo[n gi]ving aeon, life giving [life, a ble]ssed one giving blessedness, 
          a knowledge giving understanding, a goo[d one giving] goodness. It is 
          mer[cy giving] mercy and salvation. It is grace giving grac[e—not] such 
          that it possesses it but that It gives.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          <b>5</b> [How am I to speak] with you about the immeasurable, 
          incomprehen[sible light]? [For] Its [aeon] is indestructible, being 
          tranquil [and] existing in [si­lence, being at rest]. It exists prior [to 
          the All, for] It is the he[a]d of [all] the aeons [and] It gives them 
          strength in Its goodness.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          For we do not [understand these ineffable matters, and] none of us knows 
          those [immeasurable] things ex[cept for] the one who appeared from the 
          Father. This is the one who [spoke to us alone].</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          For (It is) the one who gazes at Itself [alone] in Its light that 
          sur­rounds [It], which is the spring of the living water.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And It provides for [all] the ae[ons].</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And in every way It ga[zes upon] Its image, seeing it in the spring of the 
          Spirit, willing in Its light-w[ater which is in the spri]ng of the pure 
          light[-water which] surrounds It.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And [Its thinking became a] thing. And she who ap[pea]red in Its presence 
          in [the lu]min[escence of] Its light was revealed. She is the first [power 
          who came into] being before them a[ll.. She appeared] from Its thought, 
          [the Pronoia of the All], her light [. . .] light, the [perfect] power, 
          that is, [the image of the perfect invisible vir­ginal Spirit, [the first 
          po]wer, the glory of Barbelo, the glory which is perfect in the aeons, the 
          glory of the revelation.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          [She] glorified the virginal Spirit and praised It since she had ap­peared 
          because of It. That one is the first Thought (Protennoia) of Its image. 
          She became a womb for the All because she is prior to them all, the 
          Mother-Father, the first Human, the holy Spirit, the triple male, the 
          triple power, the triple named androgyne, and the eter­nal aeon among the 
          invisible ones, and the first to come forth. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          <b>6</b> Barbelo requested the invisible virginal Spirit to give her 
          Fo[re]kn[ow]ledge. And the Spirit stared. When [It stared], Fore­knowledge 
          was revealed [an]d stood with [P]ronoia. She is from] the Thought of the 
          invisible [vir]ginal Spirit. She glorified It a[nd] Its perfect power [Ba]rbelo, 
          fo[r] it was b[eca]use of her that she had come into being.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          A[nd again she reque[st]ed (It) to give her In[destr]uct[ibility]. And It 
          stared. And in [Its staring], Indest[ruct]ibility [was revealed. And she 
          stood with Thought and Foreknowledge. She glorified the Invisible one and 
          Barbelo, for they had come into being because of her.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And Barbelo requested (It) to give her Ete[r]nal L[ife]. And the 
          in[v]isible Spirit stared. And in Its staring, Eternal Life was re­vealed. 
          And [they s]to[od]. They glorified the invisible [Spit]it and Barbelo, for 
          they had come into being because of her.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And again she asked (It) to give to her Truth. And the invisible Spirit 
          stared. Truth was revealed. And they stood. They glorified the invisible 
          Spirit who was approving and his Barbelo, for they had come into being 
          because of her.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          This is the pentad of the Aeons of the Father, who is the first Human, the 
          image of the invisible Spirit. This is Pronoia, namely: Barbelo, Thought, 
          Foreknowledge, Indestructibility, Eternal Life, and Truth. This is the 
          androgynous pentad of the Aeons which is the decad of Aeons, the Father.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          <b>7</b> And It gazed into Barbelo in the pure light which surrounds the 
          in­visible Spirit and Its luminescence, and she conceived from It. It 
          begot a spark of light in a light resembling blessedness, but it was [not] 
          equal to Its greatness. This one was only-begotten of the Mother&#8209;Father 
          who had appeared. He is his only offspring, the only-begotten of the 
          Father, the pure light.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          Then the invisible virginal Spirit rejoiced over the light [which] had 
          come into being, that one who first appeared from the first power of Its 
          Pronoia, which is Barbelo. And It [an]ointed him from Its own 
          goodness/Christhood until he became perfect, not lacking anything of [good]ness/[Christ]hood 
          because It had anointed him in the [goo]d[ndss/[Chri]st[ho]od of the 
          invisible Spirit. And he stood in Its presence while It poured upon him. 
          A[nd] im[medi]ately when he had received from the Sp[irit, he] gl[or]ified 
          the holy Spirit and the perfect Pro[n]oia, for he had been revealed 
          because of her. And he asked to be given a fellow worker, which is Mind. 
          And It stared. And in the invisible Spirit's act of staring, Mind was 
          re­vealed. And he stood with Christ, glorifying him and Barbelo, for all 
          these came into being in silence.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And Thought willed to create a work through the Word of the invisible 
          Spirit, and his Will became a work. And he was revealed with Mind and 
          Light, glorifying It. And the Word followed the Will. For because of the 
          Word, Christ the divine Autogenes created the All. Eternal Life with Will, 
          and Mind with Foreknowledge stood. They glorified the invisible Spirit and 
          Barbelo for they had come into being because of her.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And the holy Spirit perfected the divine Autogenes, the son of Itself and 
          Barbelo, so he might stand before the great and invisible virginal Spirit. 
          The divine Autogenes, the Christ, (is) that one who honored It with a 
          mighty voice. He appeared through the Pronoia. And the invisible virginal 
          Spirit placed Autogenes as true god over the All Nand It subjected to him 
          all authority and the truth which dwells in It so that he might know the 
          All. (He is) that one whose name they call by a name which is more exalted 
          than any name. For they will say that name to those who are worthy of it.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          <b>8</b> For from the light, which is the Christ, and Indestructibility, 
          through the gift of the Spirit, he gazed out so as to cause the four 
          Lights from the divine Autogenes to stand before him.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And the three (are): Will, Thought, and Life. And the four powers are: 
          Understanding, Grace, Perception, and Prudence. Now it is Grace which 
          dwells in the Light Aeon Armozel, who is the first angel. And three other 
          Aeons are with this Aeon: Grace, Truth, Form. And the second Light Oriael 
          is the one who was established over the second Aeon. And three other Aeons 
          are with him: Pronoia, Percep­tion, Memory. And the third Light is 
          Daveithai, the one who was es­tablished over the third Aeon. And the three 
          other Aeons with him are: Understanding, Love, and Likeness. And the 
          fourth Aeon was established over the fourth Light Eleleth. And the [th]ree 
          Aeons with him are: Perfection, Peace, Wisdom. These are the four Lights 
          who stand before the divine Autogenes. These are the twelve Aeons which 
          stand before the Son of the great Autogenes Christ, through the will and 
          the gift of the invisible Spirit. And the twelve Aeons belong to the Son 
          of [A]utogenes. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          <b>9</b> And the All was firmly founded through the will of the holy 
          Spirit, through Autogenes. And from the Foreknowledge of the perfect Mind 
          through the revelation of the will of the invisible Spirit and the will of 
          Autogenes, the invisible Spirit named the perfect Human, the first 
          revelation and the truth, Pigera-Adamas.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And It set him up over the first Aeon with the great Autogenes Christ, 
          beside the first Light, Armozel. And Its powers dwelled with him.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And the Invisible one gave him an unconquerable intellectual power. And he 
          spoke and glorified and praised the invisible Spirit, saying, Because of 
          you the All came into being and it is to you that the All will return. And 
          I will praise and glorify you and Autogenes with the three Aeons: the 
          Father, the Mother, the Child, the perfect power.' And It set up his Child 
          Seth over the second Aeon beside the second Light Oroiel. And in the third 
          Aeon were set up the seed of Seth over the third Light, Daveithai. And the 
          holy souls were set up. In the fourth Aeon were set up the souls of those 
          who were igno­rant of the Fullness and did not repent immediately but they 
          per­sisted a while. And afterward they repented. They dwelled beside the 
          fourth Light Eleleth. These are the creatures who glorify the in­visible 
          Spirit.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          <b>10</b> Sophia of the Epinoia, being an Aeon, thought a thought from 
          within herself and the thought of the invisible Spirit and Foreknowledge. 
          She willed a likeness to appear from within herself without the will of 
          the Spirit—It had not approved—and without her partner and without his 
          consideration. For the countenance of her masculinity did not approve, and 
          she had not found her partner. She deliberated apart from the will of the 
          Spirit and the understanding of her partner. She brought forth.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          Because of the unconquerable power within her, her thought did not remain 
          idle. And an imperfect product appeared from her, and it was different 
          from her pattern because she created it without her partner. And it was 
          not patterned after the likeness of its Mother, for it had a different 
          form. When she saw (the product of) her will, it was dif­ferent, a model 
          of a lion-faced serpent. His eyes were like flashing fires of lightning. 
          She cast him out from her, outside of those places so that none among the 
          immortals might see him, for she had cre­ated him in ignorance.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And she surrounded him with a luminous cloud. And she placed a throne in 
          the midst of the cloud in order that no one might see him except the holy 
          Spirit, who is called the mother of the living. She named him Yaltabaoth. 
          This is the Chief Ruler, the one who got a great power from his Mother.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          <b>11</b> And he withdrew from her and he abandoned the placed where he 
          had been born. He seized (another place). He created for himself another 
          aeon inside a blaze of luminous fire, which still exists now. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And he was stupefied in his Madness, the one who dwells within him, and he 
          begat some authorities for himself.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          The name of the first is Athoth, the one whom the generations call the 
          [reaper]. The second is Harmas, who is [the eye] of envy. The third is 
          Kalila-Oumbri. The fourth is Yabel. The fifth is Adonaiou, who is called 
          Sabaoth. The sixth is Cain, whom the generations of humanity call the sun. 
          The seventh is Abel. The eighth is Abrisene. The ninth is Yobel. The tenth 
          is Armoupieel. The eleventh is Melcheir-Adonein. The twelfth is Belias; he 
          is the one who is over the depth of Hades.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And he set up seven kings over the seven heavens, one per firmament of 
          heaven, and five over the depth of the abyss so that they might rule. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          <b>12</b> And he divided his fire among them, but he did not send them 
          (anything) from the power of the light which he had received from his 
          Mother. For he is ignorant darkness. When the light mixed with the 
          darkness, it caused the darkness to shine, but when the darkness mixed 
          with the light, it darkened the light, so that it became neither light nor 
          dark, but it was weak.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          Now this weak ruler has three names. The first name is Yaltabaoth. The 
          second is Saklas. The third is Samael. He is impious in his Madness, she 
          who dwells in him. For he said, am God and no other god exists except me,' 
          since he is ignorant of the place from which his strength had come.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And the Rulers created seven powers for themselves. And the powers created 
          for each of them six angels until they had produced 365 angels.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          These are the bodies of the names: The first is Athoth; he has a sheep's 
          face. The second is Eloaiou; he has a donkey's face. The third is 
          Astaphaios; he has a hyena's face. The fourth is Yao; he has a serpent's 
          face with seven heads. The fifth is Sabaoth; he has a ser­pent's face. The 
          sixth is Adonin; he has a monkey's face. The sev­enth is Sabbede; he has a 
          fiery face which shines. This is the hebdomad of the week.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          But Yaldabaoth possessed a multitude of faces, adding up to more than all 
          of them, so that when he is in the midst of the seraphim, he could 
          masquerade in front of them all at will.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          <b>13</b> He shared with them (portions) from his fire.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          Because of the power of the glory which dwells in him from the light of 
          his Mother. he became Lord over them. Because of that, he called himself 
          God, and he was not obedient to the place from which he had come.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And he mixed with the authorities who dwell with him. Through his thinking 
          and his speaking, seven powers came into being. And he named the powers 
          one after another, beginning with the highest (as follows): First is 
          Goodness/Christhood with the first (authority) Athoth. The second is 
          Pronoia with the second one Eloaio. The third is Divinity with the third 
          one Astraphaio. The fourth is Lord­ship with the fourth one Yao. The fifth 
          is kingdom with the fifth one Sabaoth. The sixth is Envy with the sixth 
          one Adonein. The seventh is Understanding with the seventh Sabbateon. For 
          these are those who have a firmament corresponding to each aeon. These 
          were named according to the glory of those who belong to heaven for the 
          destr[uction of the] power[s]. The names which they were given by the 
          Chief Begetter had power in them, but the names which were given to them 
          according to the glory of those who belong to heaven are for them 
          destruction and powerlessness. Thus they have two names.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          He ordered everything following the likeness of the first Aeons, which had 
          come into being, so that he might create them in the in­destructible 
          pattern. Not because he had seen the indestructible ones, but the power in 
          him which he had gotten from his Mother bore in him the likeness of the 
          world.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          <b>14</b> And when he saw the creation which surrounded him and the 
          multi­tude of the angels surrounding him who had came into being from him, 
          he said to them, 'I am a jealous God and no other god exists be­side me.' 
          But his proclamation indicated to the angels who dwell with him that 
          another God does exist. For if there were not another who exists, of whom 
          would he be jealous?</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          The Mother began to wander. She understood her deficiency when the 
          brightness of her light was diminished and she was darkened, because her 
          partner had not been in concord with her.&quot; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          But I said, &quot;Lord, what does it mean 'she wandered'?&quot;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          He smiled and said, `Do not think it means as Moses said 'upon the 
          waters.' But in fact, when she saw the evil which had happened and the 
          theft which her offspring had committed, she repented and she was overcome 
          with forgetfulness in the darkness of ignorance. And she began to be 
          ashamed. [She did not dare] to return but [she was ...] in motion. This 
          movement is the wandering.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          The Arrogant one had gotten a power from his Mother. For he was ignorant, 
          thinking that no one existed except his Mother alone. And seeing the 
          multitude of the angels whom he had created, he then exalted himself over 
          them.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And when the Mother understood that the garment of darkness was not 
          perfect, she then understood that her partner had not been in concord with 
          her. She repented with great weeping.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And the entreaty of her repentance was heard and all the Fullness praised 
          the invisible virginal Spirit on her behalf. The holy Spirit poured over 
          her (something) from their entire Fullness. For her partner did not come 
          to her (by himself), but it was through the Fullness that he came to her 
          in order that he might correct her de­ficiency. Yet even so, she was not 
          conveyed to her own Aeon, but (was placed) above her child so that she 
          might dwell in the Ninth until she corrects her deficiency.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          <b>15</b> And a voice came from the exalted heavenly Aeon, The Human 
          ex­ists and the Child of the Human.' The Chief Ruler, Yaltabaoth, heard 
          it, but he thought that the voice had come from his Mother, and he did not 
          understand where it had come from.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And the holy and perfect Mother-Father, the perfect Pronoia, the im­age of 
          the Invisible, who is the Father of the All, in whom the All came into 
          being, the first Human, taught them by revealing his like­ness in a male 
          model.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          The Aeon of the Chief Ruler trembled all over and the foundations of the 
          abyss quaked. And upon the waters which dwell under matter, the underside 
          was [illum]ined by the ap[pearance] of his image which had been revealed. 
          And when all the authorities and the Chief Ruler stared (on the water), 
          they saw all the region below which was shining. And by the light, they 
          saw the model of the image upon the water.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And he said to the authorities who dwell with him, 'Come, let us create a 
          human according to the image of God and according to our likeness so that 
          his image might illuminate us.' And they created (using) the power from 
          each of them according to the characteristics which they had been given.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And each one of the authorities supplied for (the human's) soul a 
          characteristic corresponding to the model of the image which he had seen. 
          He created a real being in accordance with the likeness of the perfect 
          first Human. And they said, 'Let us call him Adam in order that his name 
          might become a power of light for us.'</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And the powers began (their work): The first one, Goodness, cre­ated a 
          bone-soul. The second one, Pronoia, created a sinew-soul. The third one, 
          Divinity, made a flesh-soul. The fourth one, Lord­ship, made a 
          marrow-soul. The fifth one, Kingdom, made a blood-soul. The sixth one, 
          Envy, created a skin-soul. The seventh Understanding, created a hair-soul.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          The multitude of the angels stood before him. They received the seven 
          substances of the soul from the powers so that they might create the 
          harmony of the parts and the harmony of the limbs and the proper 
          combination of each of the parts.</p>

          The right shin, Aroer. The left shin, Toechtha. The right ankle, Aol. The

          Seven, 7, [have power] over all of these: Michael, Ouriel, Asmenedas, 
          Saphasatoel, Aarmouriam, Richram, Amiorps.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And those who are over the senses, Archendekta. And the one over the 
          perception, Deitharbathas. And the one over the imagina­tion, Oummaa. And 
          the one over the assent, Aachiaram. And the one over the whole impulse, 
          Riaramnacho.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And the source of these demons who are in the whole body is fixed as four: 
          heat, cold, wetness, dryness. And the mother of them all is matter. The 
          one who rules over the heat, Phloxpha. The one who rules over the cold, 
          Oroorrothos. The one who rules over what is dry, Erimacho. &quot;The one who 
          rules over the wetness, Athuro. The mother of all these, Onorthochrasaei 
          who is limitless, stands in their midst and she mixes with them all. And 
          truly she is matter, for they are nourished by her.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          Ephememphi is the one who belongs to pleasure. Yoko is the one who belongs 
          to desire. Nenentophni is the one who belongs to grief. Blaomen is the one 
          who belongs to fear. The mother of them all is Esthensis Ouch Epiptoe. The 
          passions come into being from these four demons. From grief (comes) envy, 
          jealousy, suffering, trouble, pain, heartlessness, anxiety, mourning, and 
          the rest. And from pleasure comes much wickedness and empty boasting and 
          simi­lar things. From desire (comes) anger, wrath, bitterness, bitter 
          yearn­ing, insatiable greed and similar things. From fear (comes) panic, 
          flattery, anguish, shame. These all resemble virtues as well as vices. The 
          insight into their true character is Anaro, who is the head of the 
          material soul which dwells with the seven senses Ouch Epiptoe. This is the 
          number of the angels: altogether they are 365. They all labored on it 
          until, part by part, the psychic and material body was completed. Now 
          others whom I have not mentioned to you rule over the rest. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          If you want to know about them, it is written in the Book of Zoroaster.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And all the angels and demons labored until they had created the psychic 
          body.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          <b>18</b> And their product was completely inactive and motionless for a 
          long time.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          But when the Mother wanted to retrieve the power which she had given to 
          the Chief Ruler, she entreated the Mother-Father of the All, the one who 
          possesses great mercy. Following the holy design, he sent the five Lights 
          down to the place of the angels of the Chief Ruler. They advised him with 
          the goal of extracting the power of the Mother.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And they said to Yaldabaoth, 'Breathe into his face by your spirit and his 
          body will arise.' And into his face he blew his spirit, which is the power 
          of his Mother. He did not understand because he dwells in ignorance. And 
          the power of the Mother left Yaldabaoth and went into the psychic body 
          that they had made according to the likeness of the one who exists from 
          the beginning. The body moved and gained power, and it was luminous.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And in that moment, the rest of the powers became jealous for it was 
          because of them all that he had come into being and they had given their 
          power to the human.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          Yet his understanding was stronger than those who had made him and greater 
          even than the Chief Ruler. When they understood that he was luminous, 
          could think better than they did, and was naked of evil, they picked him 
          up and threw him down into the lowest part of all matter.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          But the Blessed one, the Mother-Father, the beneficent and merciful, had 
          mercy upon the Mother's power that had been brought forth from the Chief 
          Ruler lest yet again they might have power over the psychic and 
          perceptible body. So through his beneficent Spirit and his great mercy, he 
          sent a helper to Adam. She is a luminous Epinoia, who is from him (and) 
          who was called Life. It is she who aids the whole creation by toiling with 
          him, guiding him by cor­rection toward his fullness, and teaching him 
          about the descent of the seed and teaching him about the path of ascent, 
          the path which it had come down. The Epinoia of the light was hidden in 
          Adam in order that the rulers might not know, but Epinoia existed as a 
          cor­rection for the deficiency of the Mother.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          <b>19</b> And the human appeared because of the shadow of the light which 
          exists within him. And his thought was superior to all those who had 
          created him. When they looked up, they saw that his thought was superior, 
          and they took counsel with the whole host of the rulers and the angels. 
          They took some fire, earth, and water. They mixed them together with each 
          other and the four fiery winds. And they wrought them together and made a 
          great disturbance. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And they enclosed him in the shadow of death in order that they might yet 
          again form from earth, water, fire, and spirit a thing from matter, which 
          is the ignorance of the darkness, desire, and their counterfeit spirit. 
          This is the tomb of the molding of the body with which the robbers clothed 
          the human, the chain of forgetfulness. And he came to be a mortal human.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          This is the one who came down first and the first partition. The Epinoia 
          of the light who was in him is the one who will awaken his thinking.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          <b>20</b> And the Rulers took him and they placed him in paradise. And
          <sub>t</sub>hey said to him, 'Eat that is in idleness. For indeed their 
          delight is bitter and their beauty is licentious. For their delight is 
          deception and their trees are impiety. And their fruit is an incurable 
          poison and their promise is death. And in the midst of paradise, they 
          planted the tree of their life.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          But I, I will teach you what the mystery of their life is, the plan they 
          made with each other, the likeness of their spirit.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          Its root is bitter and its branches are deaths. Its shade is hate and 
          deception dwells in its leaves. And its blossom is the anoint­ment of 
          evil. And its fruit is death, and desire is its seed, and it blossoms from 
          the darkness. The dwelling place of those who taste from it is Hades, and 
          the dark is their resting place.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          But what they call 'the tree of the knowledge of what is good and evil' is 
          the Epinoia of the light. They (the rulers) remained in front of it in 
          order that he might not look up to his fullness and come to know the 
          nakedness of his shamefulness. But as for me, I set them right so that 
          they would eat.&quot;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And I said to the Savior, &quot;Lord, was it not the snake who taught Adam so 
          that he would eat?&quot;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          The Savior laughed and said, &quot;The snake taught them to eat from a wicked 
          desire to sow which belongs to destruction, in order that he (Adam) would 
          become useful to it. And it knew that he was dis­obedient to it because 
          the light of Epinoia dwelled in him, making him more correct in his 
          thinking than the Chief Ruler. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          <b>21</b> And he wanted to bring out the power which he had given to him. 
          And he brought a trance upon Adam.&quot;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And I said to the Savior, &quot;What is the trance?&quot;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          He said, &quot;It is not as Moses wrote as you heard. For he said in his first 
          book that he laid him down in sleep, but rather it concerned his 
          sensibility. For indeed it is said by the prophet, 'I will make their 
          hearts heavy so that they might neither give heed nor see.'</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          Then the Epinoia of the light hid in him.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And the Chief Ruler wanted to bring her from his rib. But the Epinoia of 
          the light is not graspable. Although the dark pursued her, it did not lay 
          hold of her.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And he brought forth a part of his power from him (Adam). And he created 
          another molded form in a woman's shape according to the image of Epinoia 
          who had appeared to him. And into the molded form of womanhood he put the 
          part which he had taken from the power of the human— not 'his rib' as 
          Moses said. And he saw the woman beside him.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          Immediately, the luminous Epinoia appeared for she had uncovered the veil 
          which had been on his understanding. He became sober from the drunkenness 
          of the darkness and he recognized his likeness. And he said, 'Now this is 
          bone from my bones and flesh from my flesh. Because of this, man will 
          leave his father and his mother and he will cling to his wife and they 
          will no longer be two but a single flesh.' For his partner will be sent to 
          him and he will leave his father and his mother. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          It is our sister Sophia who came down in innocence in order that she might 
          correct her deficiency. Because of this she was called Zoe (Life), the 
          mother of the living by Pronoia of the au­thority of heaven and [...] to 
          him [. . .]. And through her they tasted the perfect knowledge.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          In the form of an eagle, I appeared on the tree of knowledge, which is the 
          Epinoia from the pure, luminous Pronoia, so that I might teach them and 
          awaken them from the depth of the sleep. For they were both in a fallen 
          state and they recognized their na­kedness. Epinoia appeared to them as 
          light, awakening their thought.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          <b>22</b> But when Yaldabaoth knew that they had withdrawn from him, he 
          cursed his earth. He found the female preparing herself for her male. He 
          was lord over her, for he did not understand the mystery which had come to 
          pass from the holy design. And they were afraid to blame him. And he 
          revealed his ignorance that dwelled in him to his angels. And he cast them 
          out of paradise and he clothed them with a dark gloom.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And the Chief Ruler saw the virgin who stood beside Adam and that the 
          living luminous Epinoia appeared in her. And Yaldabaoth was filled with 
          ignorance.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          When the Pronoia of the All knew, she sent some beings and they snatched 
          Zoe from Eve. And the Chief Ruler defiled her. And he begat two sons from 
          her. The first is Eloim and the sec­ond is Yawe. Eloim has a bear face 
          while Yawe has a lion face. The one is righteous while the other is 
          unrighteous. (IV Yawe is righ­teous, but Eloim is unrighteous.) He set 
          Yawe over the fire and the wind, while he set Eloim over water and earth. 
          He named these Cain and Abel with trickery in mind.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          Now up to the present day, intercourse has continued from the Chief Ruler. 
          And he planted a seed of desire in her who belongs to Adam. From 
          intercourse he caused birth in the likeness of bodies and he supplied them 
          from his counterfeit spirit. He set two rulers over the principalities so 
          that they might rule over the tomb.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          When Adam perceived the likeness of his own foreknowledge, he begot the 
          likeness of the Child of the Human; he called him Seth following the way 
          of the generation in the aeons.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          Likewise the Mother also sent down her Spirit in the likeness of the 
          female being who is like her, as a counterpart to she who is in the 
          Fullness, so that she might prepare a dwelling place for the aeons that 
          were going to descend.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And they were made to drink water of forgetfulness by the Chief Ruler so 
          that they would not know themselves (and would not know) where they had 
          come from.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And the seed existed like this for while: providing assistance, so that 
          when the Spirit descends from the holy aeons, it will correct (the seed) 
          and heal it from the deficiency so that the entire Fullness might become 
          holy and without deficiency.&quot;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          <b>23</b> I said to the Savior, &quot;Lord, will all the souls be delivered 
          into the pure light&quot;? </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          He replied, saying to me, &quot;These are great things that have arisen in your 
          thinking. For it is difficult to disclose these things to any others 
          except those who are from the immovable generation. Those upon whom the 
          Spirit of the Life will descend and (with whom) it will be powerfully 
          present, they will be saved and will become perfect. And they will become 
          worthy of the great realms. And they will be purified in that place from 
          all evil and the concerns of wickedness. Then they will not take care for 
          anything except the imperishability alone, attending to it from this point 
          on without anger or envy or jealousy or desire or greed of anything at 
          all. For they are not re­strained by anything except the reality of the 
          flesh alone, which they bear while fervently awaiting the time when they 
          will be visited by those who will receive (them). For such as these are 
          worthy of the imperishable eternal life and the calling, enduring 
          everything, bear­ing everything so that they might complete the contest 
          and inherit eternal life.&quot;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          I said to him, &quot;Lord, will the souls of those upon whom the power of the 
          Spirit of Life descended but who did not do these works be e[xcluded]?&quot;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          He repli[ed, s]aying to me, &quot;If [the] Spirit descends [up]on them, they 
          will be saved in any case, and they will migrate. For the power will 
          descend upon every human being—for without it, no one is able to stand 
          upright. After they are born, then if the Spirit of Life in­creases and 
          the power comes to strengthen that soul, it is not possi­ble to lead it 
          astray into the works of wickedness. But those upon whom the counterfeit 
          spirit descends are drawn by it and they are led astray.&quot;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          I said, &quot;Lord, then when the souls of those leave their flesh, where will 
          they got'</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          He laughed and said to me, &quot;The soul in which the power will be­come 
          stronger than the despicable spirit— for this one (the soul) is powerful 
          and it flees from evil— it will be saved by the visitation of the 
          Incorruptible and it will be admitted into the repose of the aeons.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          I said, &quot;Lord, then where will the souls be who do not know to whom their 
          souls belong?&quot;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          He said to me, &quot;In those, the despicable spirit has proliferated by 
          leading them astray. He burdens the soul and draws it into works of 
          wickedness, and he casts it down into forgetfulness. After it comes forth, 
          they hand it over to the authorities who came into being through the 
          Ruler. And they bind it in chains and cast it into prison. And they 
          consort with it until it awakens from forgetfulness and receives 
          knowledge. And in this way, it is perfected and saved.&quot;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          I said, &quot;Lord, how does the soul become smaller and return back into the 
          nature of its mother or the human?&quot;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          Then he rejoiced when I asked this, and he said to me, &quot;Truly you are 
          blessed, for you have understood! That soul is made to follow another who 
          has the Spirit of Life in it. It is saved by that (other) one. Then it is 
          not cast into another flesh.&quot;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And I said, &quot;Lord, what about those who understood and yet turned away? 
          Where will their souls go?&quot; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          Then he said to me, &quot;They will be admitted into that place where the 
          angels of poverty go, the place where repentance does not occur. And they 
          will guard them until that day when those who have blasphemed against the 
          Spirit will be tortured. And they will be pun­ished with an eternal 
          punishment.&quot;</p>

          troubles herself with you, that is, the Epinoia of the luminous Pronoia 
          awakened the seed of the perfect generation and its thinking and the 
          eternal light of the Human. When the Chief Ruler knew that they surpassed 
          him in excellence—for their thoughts were higher than his— he wanted to 
          restrict their planning, for he was ig­norant that they excelled him in 
          thinking and that he would not be able to restrict them. He made a plan 
          with his authorities, that is, his powers. Together they committed 
          adultery with Sophia. And through them was begotten bitter Fate, which is 
          the last of the counterfeit chains. And it is such that (it makes) each 
          one different from every other. And it is painful and it oppresses that 
          (soul) since the gods and angels and demons and all the generations have 
          inter­mingled with it up to the present day. For from that Fate appeared 
          every iniquity and injustice and blasphemy and the fetter of forgetfulness 
          and ignorance and every harsh command and severe sins and great fears. And 
          this is how they made the whole creation blind so that they might not know 
          the God who is above them all. And be­cause of the fetter of 
          forgetfulness, their sins were hidden. For they were bound with measures 
          and times and seasons—for it (Fate) was lord over them all.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And he had regrets about everything which had come into being through him. 
          Again he planned to bring a flood over the human creation.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          But the greatness of the light of Pronoia taught Noah. And he preached to 
          the whole offspring, that is, the children of the humans. But those who 
          were strangers to him did not listen to him. It is not like Moses said 
          that they hid themselves in an ark, but they were hidden — not only Noah, 
          but many other people from the immovable generation.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          They entered a place. They were hidden in a luminous cloud. And he 
          understood his authority. And she who belongs to the light was with him 
          for she illumined them, for he had brought dark­ness upon the whole earth.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          <b>25</b> And he created a plan with his powers. He sent his angels to the 
          daughters of men so that they might take some of them for them­selves, and 
          they might raise a seed, to be a respite for them. And at first they were 
          not successful, but when they did not succeed, they gathered together 
          again and made another plan. They created a de­spicable spirit in the 
          likeness of the Spirit who had descended so that through it they might 
          pollute the souls.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And the angels changed their own likenesses into the likeness of each 
          one's mate, filling them with the spirit of darkness, which they mixed 
          with them and with wickedness. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          They brought gold, silver, a gift, and copper and iron and metal and every 
          sort of thing belonging to these classes. And they beguiled the human 
          beings who had followed them into great troubles by leading them astray 
          into much error.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          They grew old without having enjoyment. They died without having found any 
          truth and without having known the God of Truth. And thus the whole 
          creation became enslaved forever, from the foundation of the world until 
          now.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And they took women; they begot children out of darkness ac­cording to the 
          likeness of their spirit. And their hearts became closed and hardened by 
          the hardening of the despicable spirit until now.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          <b>26</b> Therefore I, the perfect Pronoia of the All, changed into my 
          seed. For I existed from the first, traveling on every road. For I am the 
          wealth of the light. I am the remembrance of the fullness. I traveled into 
          the vastness of the dark, and I persevered until I entered the midst of 
          the prison. And the foundations of chaos quaked. And I hid myself from 
          them because of their evil, and they did not recog­nize me.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          Again I returned for the second time and I traveled. I came forth into 
          those who belong to the light, which is I, the remembrance of the Pronoia. 
          I entered the midst of the dark and the inside of Hades, seeking to put my 
          household in order. And the founda­tions of chaos quaked such that (it 
          seemed) they would fall down upon those who dwell in the chaos and destroy 
          them. And again I fled up to my luminous root so that they would not be 
          destroyed before the time was right.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          Still for a third time, I who am the light that exists in the light and 
          the remembrance of the Pronoia, I traveled in order to enter into the 
          midst of the darkness and the inside of Hades. I filled my coun­tenance 
          with the light of the consummation of their aeon. And I entered the midst 
          of their prison, which is the prison of the body. And I said, 'Whoever 
          hears, arise from lethargic sleep!'</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And he wept, shedding tears; heavy tears he wiped from himself. And he 
          said, 'Who is it who calls my name and from where does this hope come to 
          me who am dwelling in the fetters of the prison?' And I said, `I am the 
          Pronoia of the pure light; I am the thought of the virginal Spirit, the 
          one who raises you to the place of honor. Arise and remember that you are 
          the one who has heard, and fol­low your root, which is I, the 
          compassionate. Fortify yourself against the angels of poverty and the 
          demons of chaos and all those who en­snare you, and be watchful of the 
          lethargic sleep and the garment of the inside of Hades.'</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And I raised him up and sealed him with the light of the water with five 
          seals so that death would not have power over him from this day on.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          <b>27</b> Behold, now I will go up to the perfect aeon. I have completed 
          everything for you in your ears. I have told you ( John) all things so 
          that you might write them down and give them in secret to your fel­low 
          spirits. For this is the mystery of the immoveable generation.&quot; And the 
          Savior gave these things to him so that he might write <sub>t</sub>hem 
          down and keep them secure.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And he said to him, &quot;Cursed be any one who should exchange these things 
          for a gift, whether for food or drink or clothing or any­thing else of 
          this kind.&quot; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          And these things were given to him in a mystery. And immedi­ately he 
          disappeared before him. And he ( John) went to his fellow disciples. He 
          related to them the things which the Savior had said to him.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">
          Jesus Christ Amen.</p>

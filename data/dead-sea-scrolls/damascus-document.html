<h3>Column I - The Admonition</h3>

<p>And now hear, all you who know righteousness, and understand the works of God. For He has a dispute with all flesh, and will execute judgment on all who despise Him.</p>

<p>For when they were unfaithful in forsaking Him, He hid His face from Israel and from His sanctuary and gave them to the sword. But when He remembered the covenant of the patriarchs, He left a remnant to Israel and did not give them to destruction.</p>

<p>And in the time of wrath, three hundred and ninety years after He had given them into the hand of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, He visited them. And He caused a root of planting to spring from Israel and Aaron to inherit His land and to prosper on the good things of His earth.</p>

<p>And they perceived their iniquity and knew that they were guilty men. Yet they were like the blind and like those who grope for the way for twenty years.</p>

<p>And God observed their deeds, that they sought Him with a whole heart, and He raised for them a Teacher of Righteousness to guide them in the way of His heart.</p>

<h3>Column II - The Teacher and the Liar</h3>

<p>And he made known to the later generations what He did to the last generation, the congregation of the traitors. These are the ones who departed from the way.</p>

<p>This is the time of which it is written: "Like a stubborn heifer, so Israel was stubborn" (Hosea 4:16), when the Scoffer arose who spouted to Israel waters of lies.</p>

<p>He led them astray in a trackless wilderness, laying low the everlasting heights, abolishing the ways of righteousness and removing the boundary with which the forefathers had marked out their inheritance.</p>

<h3>Column III - The Covenant</h3>

<p>But with those who held fast to the commandments of God, who were left over of them, God established His covenant with Israel forever, revealing to them the hidden things in which all Israel had gone astray:</p>

<p>His holy Sabbaths and His glorious festivals, His righteous testimonies and His true ways, and the desires of His will which a man must do in order to live by them.</p>

<p>He opened before them a well with much water; and those who despise it shall not live. Yet they had wallowed in human transgression and ways of uncleanness, and said "This is ours."</p>

<h3>Column IV - The Three Nets of Belial</h3>

<p>During all those years Belial will be unleashed against Israel, as God spoke by the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz, saying: "Terror and pit and snare are upon you, O inhabitant of the land" (Isaiah 24:17).</p>

<p>Its interpretation: these are the three nets of Belial about which Levi son of Jacob spoke, by which he catches Israel and directs their faces to three kinds of righteousness.</p>

<p>The first is fornication, the second is wealth, and the third is the defilement of the sanctuary. Whoever escapes one is caught in another, and whoever escapes that is caught in the third.</p>

<h3>Column V - Concerning Princes</h3>

<p>The builders of the wall who have followed after "Precept"—"Precept" is the preacher of whom it says, "They shall surely preach" (Micah 2:6)—they are caught in two: in fornication, by taking two wives in their lives, though the principle of creation is "male and female He created them" (Genesis 1:27).</p>

<p>And those who entered the ark went in two by two. And concerning the prince it is written: "He shall not multiply wives for himself" (Deuteronomy 17:17).</p>

<h3>Column VI - Rules for Camps</h3>

<p>And this is the rule for the settlement of the camps. Those who walk in these during the time of wickedness, until there arises the Messiah of Aaron and Israel, shall number at least ten men.</p>

<p>And among them there shall be a priest learned in the Book of Meditation. By his word all of them shall be ruled.</p>

<p>If he is not skilled in all these matters, but a man of the Levites is skilled in them, then the lot of going out and coming in for all members of the camp shall be determined by him.</p>

<h3>Column VII - The Rule for the Assembly</h3>

<p>This is the rule for the assembly of the camps. All shall be enrolled by their names: the priests first, the Levites second, the sons of Israel third, and the proselyte fourth.</p>

<p>And they shall be written down by name, one after another: the priests first, the Levites second, the sons of Israel third, and the proselyte fourth. And thus they shall sit, and thus be questioned about everything.</p>

<h3>Column VIII - The Oath of the Covenant</h3>

<p>And anyone who enters the covenant—to act according to all these statutes, being joined to the holy congregation—they shall examine his spirit in the community, between a man and his neighbor, according to his understanding and his deeds in the Torah, under the authority of the sons of Aaron who have freely devoted themselves in the community to establish His covenant and to observe all His statutes.</p>

<p>Everyone who is added to His council shall be examined concerning his deeds, his understanding, his strength, his might, and his wealth. And they shall inscribe him in his place according to his lot in the inheritance of truth.</p>

<h3>Column IX-X - The Penal Code</h3>

<p>Anyone who lies about property, knowing that he does so, shall be excluded from the pure things of the congregation for one year and shall be fined one-fourth of his food.</p>

<p>Anyone who bears a grudge against his neighbor without cause shall be fined for one year.</p>

<p>Anyone who takes vengeance for himself in any matter shall be fined for six months.</p>

<p>Anyone who speaks foolishly shall be fined for three months.</p>

<p>Anyone who interrupts his neighbor while speaking shall be fined for ten days.</p>

<p>Anyone who lies down and sleeps at a session of the assembly shall be fined for thirty days.</p>

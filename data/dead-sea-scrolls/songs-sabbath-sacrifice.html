<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice contains thirteen songs, one for each of the first thirteen Sabbaths of the year. They describe the heavenly temple, the angelic priesthood, and the worship in the heavenly sanctuary. This is one of the earliest examples of Jewish mysticism (Merkavah).</p>

<h3>Song I - For the First Sabbath</h3>

<p>By the Instructor. Song of the sacrifice of the first Sabbath, on the fourth of the first month.</p>

<p>Praise the God of the divine beings, you who are seven times most wonderful, praising the splendor of His kingdom.</p>

<p>He established the holy of holies among the eternally holy ones, that they may be priests drawing near to Him, ministers of the Presence in His glorious innermost chamber.</p>

<p>In the congregation of all the gods of knowledge, and in the council of all the spirits of God, He engraved His laws for all the spiritual works.</p>

<h3>Song II - For the Second Sabbath</h3>

<p>By the Instructor. Song of the sacrifice of the second Sabbath, on the eleventh of the first month.</p>

<p>Let the second among the chief princes bless in the name of His truth all whose ways are pure.</p>

<p>Exalt Him, you divine beings of knowledge, with the glory of His kingdom. For in the holiness of His glory there are laws for all the wise.</p>

<p>The firmaments of the pure heavens are praising Him, and all the wings of His spirits in the heights of heights.</p>

<h3>Song VI - For the Sixth Sabbath</h3>

<p>By the Instructor. Song of the sacrifice of the sixth Sabbath, on the ninth of the second month.</p>

<p>Praise the God of divine beings, you spirits of the innermost chambers, you holy ones of the King of holiness.</p>

<p>In their wonderful sanctuaries are spirits of everlasting light, most holy living divine beings, wonderful spirits.</p>

<p>They spread out the sanctuary of His glory. They raise the chariot of His glory. They sing songs of wonder. They recount wonderful works.</p>

<h3>Song VII - The Heavenly Temple</h3>

<p>By the Instructor. Song of the sacrifice of the seventh Sabbath, on the sixteenth of the second month.</p>

<p>In the name of the holiness of the King, let seven priesthoods draw near, seven wonderful priesthoods.</p>

<p>The structures of the holy of holies are in the inner chambers of the King, structures of light most pure in the innermost chambers of His truth.</p>

<p>The works of the carvings of their walls are wonderful works, like engravings of gods. All their structures are living divine beings.</p>

<h3>Song XI - The Divine Chariot</h3>

<p>By the Instructor. Song of the sacrifice of the eleventh Sabbath, on the fourteenth of the third month.</p>

<p>Praise the most high God, you who are lofty among all the godlike beings of knowledge.</p>

<p>Let the holiest of the godlike ones sanctify the King of glory, who sanctifies by His holiness all His holy ones.</p>

<p>Chiefs of the praises of all the godlike beings, praise the God of majestic praises. For in the splendor of praises is the glory of His kingdom.</p>

<h3>Song XII - The Chariot Throne</h3>

<p>By the Instructor. Song of the sacrifice of the twelfth Sabbath, on the twenty-first of the third month.</p>

<p>Praise the God of wonder, you spirits of supreme knowledge, you eternal ones.</p>

<p>And praise Him, all you spirits of the firmaments of His glory, with all the chambers of His wonderful greatness.</p>

<p>The cherubim fall down before Him and bless. As they rise, the quiet voice of divine beings is heard, and there is a tumult of praise.</p>

<p>When they lower their wings, there is a quiet voice of divine beings. They bless the image of the chariot throne above the firmament of the cherubim.</p>

<p>And they praise the splendor of the luminous firmament beneath His glorious seat.</p>

<h3>Song XIII - The Final Sabbath</h3>

<p>By the Instructor. Song of the sacrifice of the thirteenth Sabbath, on the twenty-eighth of the third month.</p>

<p>Praise the God of all the lofty heights, all you who are eternally pure.</p>

<p>Let all the divine beings of knowledge bless the God of knowledge with the splendor of His glory.</p>

<p>Let all the priests of the inner sanctum glorify Him in the assembly of all the godlike beings of knowledge.</p>

<p>With psalms of wonder in eternal light, from the fountain of the spirits of the holy of holies.</p>

<p>All together they sing wonderful psalms in seven ways, and the sound of blessing does not cease.</p>

<p>The divine beings of the inner sanctum bless the wonderful works, and the foundations of the holy of holies declare in a quiet voice of blessing.</p>

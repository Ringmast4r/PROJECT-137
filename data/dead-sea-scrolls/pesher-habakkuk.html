<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The Pesher Habakkuk is a verse-by-verse commentary on the first two chapters of Habakkuk. The Qumran community interpreted biblical prophecies as referring to events in their own time, including references to the Teacher of Righteousness and his enemies.</p>

<h3>Column I - On Habakkuk 1:1-5</h3>

<p><strong>"The oracle that the prophet Habakkuk saw." (Habakkuk 1:1)</strong></p>

<p>The interpretation concerns those who act treacherously with the Man of Lies, for they did not believe the words of the Teacher of Righteousness from the mouth of God.</p>

<p><strong>"Look among the nations and see; be astonished and astounded. For a work is being done in your days that you would not believe if told." (Habakkuk 1:5)</strong></p>

<p>The interpretation concerns the traitors with the Man of Lies, for they did not believe what the Teacher of Righteousness told them from the mouth of God. It also concerns the traitors to the new covenant, for they did not believe in the covenant of God and profaned His holy Name.</p>

<h3>Column II - On Habakkuk 1:6</h3>

<p><strong>"For behold, I am raising up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation." (Habakkuk 1:6)</strong></p>

<p>The interpretation concerns the Kittim, who are swift and mighty in war, destroying many. They will come to possess dwelling places that are not their own. They advance across the plain, smiting and plundering the cities of the earth.</p>

<h3>Column III - On Habakkuk 1:8-9</h3>

<p><strong>"Their horses are swifter than leopards, more fierce than the evening wolves." (Habakkuk 1:8)</strong></p>

<p>The interpretation concerns the Kittim, whose horses trample the earth. They come from afar, from the coastlands of the sea, to devour all the nations like a vulture.</p>

<p><strong>"They come all of them for violence; terror goes before them." (Habakkuk 1:9)</strong></p>

<p>The interpretation concerns the Kittim, who cause many to perish by the sword—youths, adults, old men, women and children. Even upon the fruit of the womb they have no mercy.</p>

<h3>Column V - The Teacher of Righteousness</h3>

<p><strong>"Write the vision; make it plain on tablets, so he may run who reads it." (Habakkuk 2:2)</strong></p>

<p>The interpretation concerns the Teacher of Righteousness, to whom God made known all the mysteries of the words of His servants the prophets.</p>

<h3>Column VII - The Wicked Priest</h3>

<p><strong>"Woe to him who heaps up what is not his own." (Habakkuk 2:6)</strong></p>

<p>The interpretation concerns the Wicked Priest who was called by the name of truth when he first arose, but when he ruled over Israel his heart became proud, and he forsook God and betrayed the statutes for the sake of wealth.</p>

<p>He stole and amassed the wealth of the men of violence who rebelled against God, and he took the wealth of peoples, heaping sinful iniquity upon himself.</p>

<h3>Column VIII - Persecution of the Teacher</h3>

<p><strong>"Because you have plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples shall plunder you." (Habakkuk 2:8)</strong></p>

<p>The interpretation concerns the last priests of Jerusalem, who amass wealth and profit from the plunder of the peoples. But in the last days their wealth together with their plunder will be delivered into the hand of the army of the Kittim.</p>

<h3>Column IX - On the Wicked Priest</h3>

<p><strong>"Woe to him who gets evil gain for his house." (Habakkuk 2:9)</strong></p>

<p>The interpretation concerns the Wicked Priest who schemed to destroy the Poor. But God will condemn him to destruction, because he schemed to destroy the Poor.</p>

<p><strong>"You have devised shame to your house by cutting off many peoples; you have forfeited your life." (Habakkuk 2:10)</strong></p>

<p>The interpretation: this is the house of judgment, where God will give His judgment in the midst of many peoples. He will bring him up for judgment, and in their midst He will condemn him, and will punish him with fire and brimstone.</p>

<h3>Column XI - The Day of Atonement</h3>

<p><strong>"Woe to him who makes his neighbors drink, pouring out his wrath." (Habakkuk 2:15)</strong></p>

<p>The interpretation concerns the Wicked Priest, who pursued the Teacher of Righteousness to his place of exile to swallow him up in the heat of his anger. At the time of the festival of rest, the Day of Atonement, he appeared before them to swallow them up and to cause them to stumble on the Day of Fasting, their Sabbath of rest.</p>

<h3>Column XII - The Fate of the Wicked Priest</h3>

<p><strong>"You have filled yourself with shame rather than glory. Drink, you yourself, and stagger!" (Habakkuk 2:16)</strong></p>

<p>The interpretation concerns the Wicked Priest, whose ignominy was greater than his glory. For he did not circumcise the foreskin of his heart, but walked in the ways of drunkenness to quench his thirst. But the cup of the wrath of God will swallow him up.</p>

<h3>Column XIII - On Idolatry</h3>

<p><strong>"What profit is an idol when its maker has shaped it? For its maker trusts in his own creation when he makes speechless idols!" (Habakkuk 2:18)</strong></p>

<p>The interpretation concerns all the idols of the nations, which they made so that they might serve them and bow down before them. But they will not save them on the day of judgment.</p>

<p><strong>"But the LORD is in His holy temple; let all the earth keep silence before Him." (Habakkuk 2:20)</strong></p>

<p>The interpretation concerns all the nations who serve stone and wood. But on the day of judgment God will destroy from the earth all the idolatrous and wicked.</p>

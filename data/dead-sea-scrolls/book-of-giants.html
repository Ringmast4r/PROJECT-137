<p><em>Multiple fragmentary copies found at Qumran (4Q203, 4Q530-533, 6Q8)</em></p>
<hr>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The Book of Giants is related to 1 Enoch and tells the story of the Nephilim, the giant offspring of the Watchers (fallen angels) and human women. The giants receive prophetic dreams warning of the coming flood, and they send Mahaway to consult Enoch for interpretation.</p>

<h3>Fragment 1 - The Watchers Descend</h3>

<p>In the days of Jared, two hundred Watchers descended to Mount Hermon and saw that the daughters of men were beautiful.</p>

<p>And they took wives for themselves from all that they chose. And they began to go in unto them and to defile themselves with them.</p>

<p>And the women bore giants, and the whole earth was filled with blood and unrighteousness.</p>

<h3>Fragment 2 - Names of the Giants</h3>

<p>These are the names of the giants: Ohya and Hahya, born to Shemihazah; and Mahaway, born to Baraq'el.</p>

<p>And there was Gilgamesh, the powerful one, and Hobabish, and all the giants began to devour one another.</p>

<p>And they went to the beasts and the birds and the fish and devoured their flesh one with another, and drank the blood.</p>

<h3>Fragment 3 - The Dreams of the Giants</h3>

<p>Then Ohya said to Hahya his brother: "I have had a vision this night. Behold, the Ruler of the heavens descended to earth, and thrones were set up, and the Great Holy One sat upon them."</p>

<p>"And behold, books were opened, and judgment was passed, and the sentence was written down upon the eternal tablets concerning all the living and the flesh."</p>

<p>And Hahya said: "I too have seen a vision this night. I saw a great garden, and it was watered, and behold, gardeners came and watered the trees. But fire came down from heaven and burned everything until only three remained."</p>

<h3>Fragment 4 - Interpretation Sought</h3>

<p>And they were afraid, all of them, and they called Mahaway and sent him to Enoch the scribe.</p>

<p>And they said to him: "Go to Enoch, who knows the interpretation of dreams, and tell him our visions, and ask him to interpret our dreams."</p>

<p>And Mahaway flew on his wings and rose over the desolate lands and crossed the great sea. And he came to the place where Enoch dwelt.</p>

<h3>Fragment 5 - Mahaway's Flight</h3>

<p>Mahaway mounted up and flew like one of the eagles, and he left behind the inhabited world.</p>

<p>He passed over the great desert. And Enoch saw him and called out to him. And Mahaway said to him:</p>

<p>"I have come to you, O Enoch, at the request of the giants, and at the request of Shemihazah their father, and all his companions. We have dreamed dreams and are troubled by them."</p>

<h3>Fragment 6 - Enoch's Response</h3>

<p>And Enoch replied: "The dream shows that judgment has been decreed against you and your fathers, the Watchers of heaven, because of what you have done on earth."</p>

<p>"The garden is the earth; the trees are the peoples. The three that remained are Noah and his sons, who will be saved from the destruction that comes."</p>

<p>"For behold, destruction is coming upon all the earth, a flood, and it will destroy all flesh."</p>

<h3>Fragment 7 - The Giants' Despair</h3>

<p>Then Mahaway returned and told his brothers all that Enoch had spoken.</p>

<p>And when the giants heard these things, they were greatly distressed. And Ohya began to weep and all the giants with him.</p>

<p>And they said: "We will surely die, and there is no deliverance for us. For we have sinned and transgressed, and there is no one to help us."</p>

<h3>Fragment 8 - The Nephilim's Violence</h3>

<p>And the giants continued their violence upon the earth. They devoured all the labor of men until men could no longer sustain them.</p>

<p>And the giants turned against men and began to devour mankind. And they began to sin against birds and beasts and reptiles and fish.</p>

<p>And their flesh devoured one another's flesh, and they drank the blood.</p>

<h3>Fragment 9 - The Coming Judgment</h3>

<p>Then the earth made accusation against the lawless ones. And the cry of the earth went up to the gates of heaven.</p>

<p>And Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel looked down from heaven and saw much blood being shed upon the earth.</p>

<p>And they said: "The earth, made without inhabitant, has cried out. The voice of their crying has reached the gates of heaven."</p>

<h3>Fragment 10 - Divine Decree</h3>

<p>Then the Most High spoke and sent his angels to the Watchers:</p>

<p>"Say to them: You have no peace. A grave judgment has come upon you. You will be bound for all the generations until the day of the great judgment."</p>

<p>"And as for the giants who were born from spirit and flesh, they shall be called evil spirits upon the earth, and on the earth shall be their dwelling."</p>

<p>"Evil spirits proceed from their bodies. Because they are created from above, and from the holy Watchers was their origin, they shall be evil spirits upon the earth, and evil spirits shall they be called."</p>

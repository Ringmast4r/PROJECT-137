<p><em>Hebrew: Hodayot - Songs of Praise and Thanksgiving</em></p>
<p><em>Found in Cave 1 at Qumran - One of the original seven scrolls</em></p>
<hr>

<h3>Hymn 1 - The Teacher's Thanksgiving</h3>

<p>I thank You, O Lord,<br>
for You have redeemed my soul from the Pit,<br>
and from the Sheol of Abaddon<br>
You have raised me up to everlasting height.</p>

<p>I walk on limitless level ground,<br>
and I know there is hope for him<br>
whom You have shaped from dust<br>
for the everlasting Council.</p>

<p>You have cleansed a perverse spirit of great sin<br>
that it may stand with the host of the Holy Ones,<br>
and that it may enter into community<br>
with the congregation of the Sons of Heaven.</p>

<h3>Hymn 2 - Confession of Human Weakness</h3>

<p>I thank You, O Lord,<br>
for You have enlightened me through Your truth.<br>
In Your marvelous mysteries,<br>
and in Your loving-kindness to a man of sin,<br>
and in the abundance of Your mercy to a perverse heart.</p>

<p>What is he, man, that is but earth?<br>
Kneaded from water, his foundation is guilty sin,<br>
shameful nakedness, a source of uncleanness,<br>
over which a spirit of perversity rules.</p>

<p>If he acts wickedly,<br>
he becomes an everlasting sign,<br>
a portent for the generations,<br>
an object of horror to all flesh.</p>

<h3>Hymn 3 - The Teacher's Persecution</h3>

<p>I thank You, O Lord,<br>
for You have placed my soul in the bundle of the living,<br>
and have hedged me about<br>
against all the snares of the Pit.</p>

<p>Violent men have sought after my life<br>
because I have clung to Your Covenant.<br>
For they, an assembly of deceit,<br>
and a horde of Belial,<br>
know not that my stand is from You.</p>

<p>You have saved my life from the Pit,<br>
and have raised my horn on high.<br>
I shine with a sevenfold light,<br>
in the Council which You have established for Your glory.</p>

<h3>Hymn 4 - The Suffering Servant</h3>

<p>I thank You, O Lord,<br>
for You have upheld me by Your strength.<br>
You have shed Your Holy Spirit upon me<br>
that I may not stumble.</p>

<p>You have strengthened me<br>
before the battles of wickedness,<br>
and during all their disasters<br>
You have not permitted that fear<br>
should cause me to desert Your Covenant.</p>

<p>You have set me like a strong tower,<br>
like a high wall;<br>
You have established my building upon rock,<br>
eternal foundations serve as my ground,<br>
and all my walls are a tested wall which cannot be shaken.</p>

<h3>Hymn 5 - Creation and Knowledge</h3>

<p>I thank You, O Lord,<br>
for You have illumined my face by Your Covenant.<br>
I seek You,<br>
and as sure as the dawn<br>
You appear to me.</p>

<p>Teachers of lies have smoothed Your people with words,<br>
and false prophets have led them astray;<br>
they perish without understanding<br>
for their works are in folly.</p>

<p>But I, through You, have become<br>
like a spring of flowing water,<br>
like an irrigation channel through a garden,<br>
like rain upon grass,<br>
and like showers upon what grows.</p>

<h3>Hymn 6 - The Light of Knowledge</h3>

<p>I thank You, O Lord,<br>
for You have placed me at a source of streams in dry ground,<br>
a spring of water in a land of drought,<br>
a well-watered garden,<br>
a planting of cypress, pine and cedar together for Your glory.</p>

<p>Trees of life are hidden<br>
among all trees by the waters,<br>
they shall put forth a shoot of the everlasting planting.<br>
Before they flower they send out roots to the stream.</p>

<p>Its trunk is open to the living waters,<br>
and it becomes an everlasting spring.<br>
On its leafy branches every beast of the forest feeds,<br>
its trunk is trodden by all who pass,<br>
and its branches by all winged birds.</p>

<h3>Hymn 7 - The Mystery of Knowledge</h3>

<p>I thank You, O Lord,<br>
for You have given me understanding of Your truth<br>
and have made me know Your wonderful secrets.<br>
Your loving-kindness is upon a man of perversity<br>
and the abundance of Your mercy is on a crooked heart.</p>

<p>Where could I find one like You?<br>
What creature of clay can do great things?<br>
From sinful birth and from the womb<br>
he is given over to guilty iniquity.</p>

<p>Righteousness, I know, is not of man,<br>
nor is perfection of way of a son of man;<br>
to the Most High God belong all righteous deeds.</p>

<h3>Hymn 8 - The Community of the Covenant</h3>

<p>I thank You, O Lord,<br>
for You have set my soul in life<br>
and have given me knowledge of Your testimonies.<br>
I will praise Your Name among those who fear You.</p>

<p>With songs of thanksgiving I will open my mouth,<br>
and my tongue shall ever recite<br>
both Your righteousness and the deeds of Your hands,<br>
for You have done wonders.</p>

<p>You have dealt graciously with the poor one<br>
and have brought him into Your purifying waters for judgment.<br>
You have strengthened his loins to stand<br>
before the army of the wicked.</p>

<h3>Hymn 9 - Final Thanksgiving</h3>

<p>Blessed are You, O Lord,<br>
for You have not abandoned the orphan<br>
or despised the poor.<br>
Your might is without bound<br>
and Your glory is without measure.</p>

<p>Wonderful Counselors are among Your glory;<br>
but man, in his lot of vileness,<br>
and his inheritance of guilt—<br>
what can he say?<br>
What can he answer before You?</p>

<p>You are the Prince of gods<br>
and King of the glorious ones,<br>
Lord of every spirit<br>
and Ruler of every creature.<br>
Without You nothing is done,<br>
and nothing is known without Your will.</p>

<p>There is no one beside You,<br>
and no one approaches You in strength.<br>
Nothing compares with Your glory,<br>
and Your might—there is no price.</p>

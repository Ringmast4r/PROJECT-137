<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The Temple Scroll presents itself as divine revelation given directly by God to Moses. Written in the first person as God speaking, it provides detailed instructions for building an ideal temple and laws for the king and the nation.</p>

<h3>Column II - God Speaks to Moses</h3>

<p>"I am the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. You shall not have other gods before Me. You shall not make for yourself a graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or on the earth below or in the waters under the earth."</p>

<h3>Column III-XIII - The Temple Plan</h3>

<p>"And you shall make a house for Me, and I will cause My glory to rest upon it until the day of creation, when I will create My Temple and establish it for Myself for all days, according to the covenant which I have made with Jacob at Bethel."</p>

<p>The house which you shall build for Me shall have three courts: the inner court, the middle court, and the outer court.</p>

<p>The inner court shall be one hundred cubits in length and one hundred cubits in width, a square round about. The wall of the court shall be five cubits wide and its height forty cubits.</p>

<p>You shall make chambers in the wall of the inner court all around, their width ten cubits and their length twenty cubits.</p>

<h3>Column XIV-XVII - The Temple Furniture</h3>

<p>You shall make a table of pure gold before the ark. Its length shall be two cubits, its width one cubit, and its height one and a half cubits.</p>

<p>You shall make upon it a molding of gold around it, and you shall make the dishes, spoons, bowls, and pitchers of pure gold.</p>

<p>And you shall place upon the table the bread of the Presence before Me continually.</p>

<p>You shall make a lampstand of pure gold. The lampstand shall be made of hammered work: its base, its shaft, its cups, its buds, and its flowers shall be of one piece with it.</p>

<h3>Column XVIII-XXI - The Courts and Gates</h3>

<p>The middle court shall be in the middle between the inner court and the outer court. Its wall shall be one hundred cubits from the wall of the inner court.</p>

<p>You shall make three gates in the middle court: one gate to the east, one to the north, and one to the south. The width of each gate shall be thirty cubits.</p>

<p>The outer court shall be around the middle court. Its wall shall be four hundred cubits from the wall of the middle court on each side.</p>

<p>In this court, no woman shall enter, nor any child until the day when he fulfills the statute of the law and pays his ransom to the LORD.</p>

<h3>Column XXII-XXIX - Festival Laws</h3>

<p>You shall count seven complete weeks from the day after the Sabbath, from the day you bring the sheaf of the wave offering. Until the day after the seventh Sabbath you shall count fifty days.</p>

<p>Then you shall present a new grain offering to the LORD. From your dwelling places you shall bring two loaves as a wave offering, made of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour, baked with leaven, as firstfruits to the LORD.</p>

<p>You shall offer new wine for the drink offering, one-fourth of a hin for each lamb. Pour out the drink offering of strong drink to the LORD in the holy place.</p>

<h3>Column XXX-XL - Purity Laws</h3>

<p>Any person who touches a human bone, whether it be the bone of one who is dead or the bone of one who has been killed or the grave of a man, shall be unclean for seven days.</p>

<p>He shall purify himself with the water for impurity on the third day and on the seventh day, and he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and at evening he shall be clean.</p>

<p>But if he does not purify himself on the third day and on the seventh day, he shall not be clean. Any person who touches him shall be unclean until evening.</p>

<h3>Column LVI-LIX - The Law of the King</h3>

<p>When you enter the land which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, and you possess it and settle in it, and you say, "I will set a king over me like all the nations around me"—</p>

<p>You shall surely set a king over you whom the LORD your God chooses. From among your brethren you shall set a king over you. You may not put a foreigner over you who is not your brother.</p>

<p>He shall not multiply horses for himself, nor shall he cause the people to return to Egypt to multiply horses, since the LORD has said to you, "You shall never return that way again."</p>

<p>He shall not multiply wives for himself, lest his heart turn away. Nor shall he greatly multiply silver and gold for himself.</p>

<p>When he sits on the throne of his kingdom, he shall write for himself a copy of this law in a book, from that which is before the Levitical priests.</p>

<p>It shall be with him, and he shall read it all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes.</p>

<h3>Column LX-LXVI - Laws of Warfare</h3>

<p>When you go out to battle against your enemies and see horses and chariots, a people more numerous than you, do not be afraid of them, for the LORD your God who brought you up from the land of Egypt is with you.</p>

<p>When you come near to the battle, the priest shall approach and speak to the people. He shall say to them: "Hear, O Israel! You are approaching battle against your enemies today. Do not let your hearts faint. Do not be afraid or tremble or be terrified because of them, for the LORD your God is He who goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you."</p>

<h3>Column I - Purpose of the Community</h3>

<p>For the Instructor, to teach the holy ones to live according to the Book of the Community Rule: to seek God with all one's heart and with all one's soul, to do what is good and right before Him as He commanded through Moses and through all His servants the Prophets;</p>

<p>To love all that He has chosen and to hate all that He has rejected; to distance oneself from all evil and to cling to all good works;</p>

<p>To practice truth, righteousness and justice in the land; to walk no longer in the stubbornness of a guilty heart and lustful eyes, doing all evil;</p>

<p>To bring all those who have freely devoted themselves to do God's statutes into a covenant of loving-kindness; to be united in God's counsel and to walk before Him perfectly according to all that has been revealed concerning their appointed times;</p>

<p>To love all the Sons of Light, each according to his lot in God's council, and to hate all the Sons of Darkness, each according to his guilt in the vengeance of God.</p>

<h3>Column II - Entrance into the Covenant</h3>

<p>All who enter the Rule of the Community shall pass into the covenant before God, agreeing to do according to all that He has commanded and not to turn away from Him through any fear or terror or trial that may come upon them during the dominion of Belial.</p>

<p>When they pass into the covenant, the Priests and the Levites shall bless the God of salvation and all His works of truth, and all those entering the covenant shall say after them, "Amen! Amen!"</p>

<p>Then the Priests shall recite the mercies of God shown in His mighty acts, and they shall proclaim all His loving-kindness toward Israel.</p>

<p>And the Levites shall recite the iniquities of the Sons of Israel and all their guilty transgressions and their sins during the dominion of Belial.</p>

<p>And all those entering the covenant shall confess after them, saying: "We have acted perversely, we have transgressed, we have sinned, we have done wickedly, we and our fathers before us, in walking contrary to the statutes of truth."</p>

<h3>Column III - The Two Spirits</h3>

<p>From the God of Knowledge comes all that is and shall be. Before they existed He established all their designs, and when they exist according to their appointed times, they accomplish their task according to His glorious design, changing nothing.</p>

<p>He created man to rule the world and assigned two spirits to him in which to walk until the time of His visitation: these are the spirits of truth and of perversity.</p>

<p>The origin of truth is in a spring of light, and the origin of perversity is from a source of darkness. Dominion over all the Sons of Righteousness lies in the hand of the Prince of Light; they walk in the ways of light. All dominion over the Sons of Perversity lies in the hand of the Angel of Darkness; they walk in the ways of darkness.</p>

<p>It is because of the Angel of Darkness that all the Sons of Righteousness go astray, and all their sins, iniquities, guilt and rebellious works are caused by his dominion according to God's mysteries until the time appointed by Him.</p>

<h3>Column IV - The Ways of the Two Spirits</h3>

<p>These are the ways of the spirit of truth in the world: to enlighten the heart of man, to level before him all the ways of true righteousness, to instill in his heart fear of the judgments of God, a spirit of humility, patience, abundant compassion, eternal goodness, insight, understanding, mighty wisdom believing in all God's works and trusting in His abundant loving-kindness.</p>

<p>A spirit of knowledge in every purpose, zeal for righteous judgment, holy thought with sustained purpose, abundant love toward all the Sons of Truth, glorious purity loathing all unclean idols, modest conduct together with general prudence, and concealment of the truth of the mysteries of knowledge.</p>

<p>But to the spirit of perversity belong greed, slackness in the service of righteousness, wickedness and falsehood, pride and haughtiness, lying and deceit, cruelty and great impiety, impatience and much foolishness, and zeal for shameful works in a spirit of fornication, and ways of defilement in the service of uncleanness.</p>

<h3>Column V - Rules for Community Life</h3>

<p>And this is the rule for the men of the Community who have freely devoted themselves to turn from all evil and to cling to all His commandments according to His will:</p>

<p>They shall separate themselves from the congregation of the men of perversity and shall unite with respect to doctrine and property, and they shall be accountable to the Sons of Zadok, the Priests who keep the Covenant, and to the multitude of the men of the Community who hold fast to the Covenant.</p>

<p>Every decision concerning doctrine, property, and justice shall be made by them. They shall practice truth together and humility, righteousness and justice, loving-kindness and modesty in all their ways.</p>

<p>No one shall walk in the stubbornness of his heart to go astray after his heart and eyes and thoughts of guilty inclination. Rather, he shall circumcise in the Community the foreskin of inclination and stiff neck so as to lay a foundation of truth for Israel, for the Community of the eternal Covenant.</p>

<h3>Column VI - Meetings and Discipline</h3>

<p>And this is the rule for the session of the Many. Each in his order: the Priests shall sit first, the elders second, and the rest of all the people shall sit each in his order.</p>

<p>And in this order they shall be questioned concerning judgment and every counsel and matter which concerns the Many, each offering his knowledge to the Council of the Community.</p>

<p>No one shall speak during the speech of his companion before his brother has finished speaking. Neither shall anyone speak before his proper rank. The man who is questioned shall speak in his turn.</p>

<p>And in the session of the Many no one shall speak any word without the consent of the Many, or of the Guardian of the Many.</p>

<h3>Column VIII - The Council of the Community</h3>

<p>In the Council of the Community there shall be twelve men and three Priests, perfectly versed in all that is revealed of the whole Law, to practice truth, righteousness, justice, loving-kindness and modesty one with another.</p>

<p>They shall preserve faith in the land with steadfastness and meekness, and shall atone for sin by practicing justice and by suffering the sorrows of affliction.</p>

<p>They shall walk with all men according to the standard of truth and the rule of the time. When these exist in Israel, the Council of the Community shall be established in truth as an eternal planting, a holy house for Israel, and a most holy assembly for Aaron.</p>

<h3>Column IX - The Instructor's Teaching</h3>

<p>These are the statutes for the Instructor by which he shall walk with every living being, according to the rule proper to every time and according to the weight of every man.</p>

<p>He shall do the will of God according to all that has been revealed for each time, and he shall study all the wisdom found according to the times and the statute of the time.</p>

<p>He shall separate and weigh the Sons of Righteousness according to their spirits. He shall cling to the chosen ones of the time according to His will, as He has commanded.</p>

<p>He shall judge each man according to his spirit. He shall admit each man according to the cleanness of his hands and advance him according to his understanding. And so shall be his love and so shall be his hate.</p>

<p>He shall not reprove or dispute with the men of the Pit, but shall conceal the counsel of the Law among the men of perversity.</p>

<h3>Column X-XI - Hymn of the Instructor</h3>

<p>With the coming of day and night I will enter the Covenant of God, and when evening and morning depart I will recite His statutes.</p>

<p>I will place their boundary without turning back. I will declare His judgment according to my perversity, and my transgressions shall be before my eyes as an engraved statute.</p>

<p>I will say to God, "My Righteousness," and "Author of my Good" to the Most High, "Source of Knowledge" and "Spring of Holiness," "Summit of Glory" and "Almighty of eternal Majesty."</p>

<p>I will choose that which He teaches me and will delight in His judgment of me. Before I move my hands and feet I will bless His Name. Before I go out or come in, sit or rise, and when I lie down on my couch, I will sing to Him.</p>

<p>I will bless Him with the offering of the utterance of my lips in the row of men, and before I raise my hand to feast on the delights of the earth's produce.</p>

<p>At the onset of fear and dread, and in the place of affliction and distress, I will bless Him for His exceeding wonders and will meditate on His power. I will lean on His loving-kindness throughout the day. I know that in His hand is the judgment of all the living and that all His works are truth.</p>

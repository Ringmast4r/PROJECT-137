<p><em>An Aramaic retelling and expansion of Genesis</em></p>
<p><em>Found in Cave 1 at Qumran - One of the original seven scrolls</em></p>
<hr>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Genesis Apocryphon is an Aramaic text that retells and expands stories from Genesis, written in first person from the perspectives of Lamech, Noah, and Abraham. It includes details not found in the biblical account.</p>

<h3>Column II - Lamech's Suspicion</h3>

<p>Then I, Lamech, was troubled in my heart and approached Bitenosh my wife and said:</p>

<p>"By the Most High, the Great Lord, the King of all ages, I adjure you to tell me in truth whether this child is from one of the Watchers, from one of the holy ones, or from the giants."</p>

<p>"For I have seen that this child is not like us. His eyes are like the rays of the sun, and his face is glorious."</p>

<p>Then Bitenosh my wife spoke to me with great passion, weeping, and said: "O my lord and brother, remember my pleasure! I swear to you by the Great Holy One, the King of heaven, that this seed is from you, and this conception is from you, and this fruit was planted by you."</p>

<h3>Column V - Noah's Birth</h3>

<p>And when Methuselah heard these things, he went to Enoch his father to learn all things from him truthfully.</p>

<p>And Enoch his father answered him and said: "In truth I tell you, my son Methuselah, this child who has been born to Lamech is from Lamech and not from the Watchers."</p>

<p>"But a time is coming upon the earth and upon all who dwell on it, and a great destruction will come upon them. And now make known to Lamech your son that this child is truly his son, and call his name Noah, for he will be a remnant for you."</p>

<h3>Column VI - The Flood</h3>

<p>I, Noah, was a righteous man, and I walked with God. And God said to me: "The end of all flesh has come before Me, for the earth is filled with violence."</p>

<p>"Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood. You shall make rooms in the ark, and you shall cover it inside and outside with pitch."</p>

<p>And I did all that God commanded me. And I went into the ark, I and my sons and my wife and my sons' wives.</p>

<h3>Column X - After the Flood</h3>

<p>And the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. And I opened the window of the ark and looked, and behold, the tops of the mountains could be seen.</p>

<p>And I sent forth a dove, but she found no resting place for the sole of her foot, and she returned to me to the ark.</p>

<p>And after seven days I again sent forth the dove, and she returned to me in the evening, and behold, in her mouth was an olive leaf.</p>

<h3>Column XII - Division of the Earth</h3>

<p>And I, Noah, divided the whole earth among my three sons: to Shem the middle portion, to Ham the south, and to Japheth the north.</p>

<p>And I made them swear by the name of the Great and Holy One that they would not encroach upon each other's inheritance.</p>

<h3>Column XIX - Abraham in Egypt</h3>

<p>And I, Abram, had a dream in the night of my entry into the land of Egypt. And I saw in my dream a cedar tree and a palm tree.</p>

<p>And men came and sought to cut down the cedar and to leave the palm alone. But the palm cried out and said: "Do not cut down the cedar, for we are both from one root."</p>

<p>And I awoke from my sleep in the night and said to Sarai my wife: "I have had a dream, and I am afraid because of this dream."</p>

<p>And she said to me: "Tell me your dream that I may know it." And I told her the dream, and I said: "The dream shows that they will seek to kill me and to spare you. Therefore say that you are my sister, so that I may live on account of you."</p>

<h3>Column XX - Sarai's Beauty</h3>

<p>And it came to pass when the king of Egypt heard of Sarai, he sent his princes to see her. And the princes came and saw Sarai.</p>

<p>And they praised her to the king, saying: "How beautiful is the form of her face, and how fine is the hair of her head! How lovely are her eyes, and how pleasant is her nose and all the radiance of her face!"</p>

<p>"How beautiful are her breasts and how perfect is all her whiteness! Her arms, how beautiful! And her hands, how perfect! How lovely is the whole appearance of her hands!"</p>

<p>"How fair are her palms and how long and slender are all the fingers of her hands! Her feet, how beautiful! How perfect are her legs! There are no virgins or brides who enter a bridal chamber more beautiful than she."</p>

<h3>Column XXI - Abraham's Prayer</h3>

<p>And that night the Most High God sent a pestilent spirit to afflict him and all the men of his household, an evil spirit that kept afflicting him and all the men of his household.</p>

<p>And he was not able to approach her, nor did he have relations with her, though he was with her for two years.</p>

<p>And at the end of two years the afflictions grew worse and stronger upon him and upon all the men of his household. And he sent and called all the wise men of Egypt and all the magicians, together with all the healers of Egypt, to heal him.</p>

<p>But they were not able to heal him, for the spirit afflicted all of them, and they fled.</p>

<h3>Column XXII - Abraham Heals Pharaoh</h3>

<p>Then Harkenosh came to me and asked me to come and pray for the king. And I prayed for him, and I laid my hands upon his head.</p>

<p>And the plague departed from him, and the evil spirit was rebuked and fled from him. And the king lived.</p>

<p>And the king said to me: "What have you done to me? Why did you say 'She is my sister,' so that I took her to be my wife? Here is your wife. Take her and go!"</p>

<p>And the king gave me many gifts: silver and gold, much clothing of fine linen and purple, and he assigned men to escort me out of all the land of Egypt.</p>

<h3>Column I - The War Against the Kittim</h3>

<p>For the Instructor: The Rule of War. The first engagement of the Sons of Light shall be to attack the lot of the Sons of Darkness, the army of Belial: the troop of Edom, Moab, the sons of Ammon, the Philistines, and the troops of the Kittim of Assyria. With them as helpers are those who act wickedly against the Covenant.</p>

<p>The sons of Levi, the sons of Judah, and the sons of Benjamin, the exiles of the wilderness, shall fight against them and their troops, against all their troops, when the exiles of the Sons of Light return from the Wilderness of the Nations to camp in the Wilderness of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>After the battle they shall go up from there and the King of the Kittim shall enter Egypt. In his time he shall go forth with great wrath to wage war against the kings of the north, and in his anger he shall seek to destroy and to cut off the horn of Israel.</p>

<p>This shall be a time of salvation for the People of God, and a time of dominion for all the men of His lot, but eternal destruction for all the lot of Belial.</p>

<h3>Column II - The Organization of the Army</h3>

<p>The Rule for arranging the battle divisions for the war, when their army is complete, for the gates of the battle lines.</p>

<p>On the trumpets of assembly they shall write "The Called of God." On the trumpets of the officers they shall write "The Princes of God." On the trumpets of enrollment they shall write "The Rule of God."</p>

<p>On the trumpets of the camps they shall write "The Peace of God in the Camps of His Saints." On the trumpets of breaking camp they shall write "The Mighty Works of God to Scatter the Enemy and Put to Flight All Those Who Hate Justice."</p>

<p>On the trumpets of the battle formations they shall write "Formations of the Divisions of God to Avenge His Anger on All the Sons of Darkness."</p>

<h3>Column III - The Standards and Banners</h3>

<p>On the great standard at the head of all the people they shall write "People of God" together with the names of Israel and Aaron and the names of the twelve tribes of Israel according to their order of birth.</p>

<p>On the standard of the camp of the three tribes they shall write "The Right Hand of God," "Set at the Appointed Time," "The Hammer of God," "The Camp of God." These they shall write at their departing to battle.</p>

<p>When they return from battle they shall write "The Exaltation of God," "The Greatness of God," "The Praises of God," "The Glory of God."</p>

<h3>Column IV - The Shields and Weapons</h3>

<p>On the shield of the Prince of the whole congregation they shall write his name, the name "Israel," "Levi," and "Aaron," and the names of the twelve tribes of Israel according to their order of birth, and the names of the twelve commanders of their tribes.</p>

<p>The length of the shield shall be two and a half cubits, and its width one and a half cubits. The spear shall be seven cubits in length, of which the socket and the blade shall be half a cubit.</p>

<p>All the swords shall be of purified iron, refined in a crucible and whitened like a mirror, the work of a skillful craftsman.</p>

<h3>Column VII - The Battle Lines</h3>

<p>When they have stationed themselves in their lines, the priests shall blow for them on the six trumpets of assembly, a steady note for the arraying of the battle.</p>

<p>The Levites and all the people with horns shall blow a great battle blast to terrify the heart of the enemy.</p>

<p>With the sound of the blast the battle javelins shall fly out to bring down the slain. The noise of the horns shall grow quiet, but the priests shall keep blowing on the trumpets to guide the battle until the enemy has been smitten and put to flight.</p>

<p>The priests shall blow to direct the battle, and at their signal the men of the main battle line shall go forth with their javelins.</p>

<h3>Column X - The Priest's Prayer Before Battle</h3>

<p>Then the High Priest shall stand, and his brethren the priests and the Levites and all the elders of the battle line with him. He shall bless the God of Israel and all His works of truth in their presence, and shall curse Belial and all the spirits of his lot.</p>

<p>He shall respond and say: "Blessed be the God of Israel for all His holy purpose and His works of truth. Blessed be all those who serve Him in righteousness, who know Him by faith.</p>

<p>"Cursed be Belial for his contentious purpose, and may he be execrated for his guilty dominion. Cursed be all the spirits of his lot for their wicked purpose. May they be execrated for all their service of uncleanness."</p>

<h3>Column XI - The Thanksgiving After Victory</h3>

<p>After they have withdrawn from the slain to enter the camp, all of them shall sing the Hymn of Return. In the morning they shall wash their garments and cleanse themselves of the blood of the sinful corpses.</p>

<p>They shall return to their stations before the battle line and there each man shall recite his thanksgiving:</p>

<p>"Blessed be the God of Israel who keeps loving-kindness for His covenant and testimonies of salvation for the people He has redeemed. He has called the waverers to wondrous mighty works. He has gathered in the assembly of the nations for destruction without remnant.</p>

<p>"He has raised up in judgment those whose hearts had melted. He has opened the mouth of the dumb for songs of praise, and has taught feeble hands to make war. He has given the unsteady knee strength to stand, and has hardened the backs of the smitten.</p>

<p>"By the poor in spirit shall all the nations of wickedness come to an end, and all who exalt themselves shall be brought low."</p>

<h3>Column XII - God's Role in Battle</h3>

<p>For the battle is Yours! Their bodies are crushed by the might of Your hand, and there is no one to bury them.</p>

<p>You delivered Goliath of Gath, a giant warrior, into the hands of David Your servant, because he trusted in Your great Name and not in sword and spear.</p>

<p>For the battle is Yours! You subdued the Philistines many times by the hand of our kings through Your holy name.</p>

<p>Through Your anointed ones, seers of testimonies, You have made known to us the times of the wars of Your hands, to glorify Yourself among our enemies, to bring down the hordes of Belial, the seven vain nations, by the hand of the poor whom You have redeemed.</p>

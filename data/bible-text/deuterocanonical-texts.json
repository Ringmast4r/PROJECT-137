        "1:1": "Love righteousness, ye that be judges of the earth: think of the Lord with a good (heart,) and in simplicity of heart seek him.",
        "1:2": "For he will be found of them that tempt him not; and sheweth himself unto such as do not distrust him.",
        "1:3": "For froward thoughts separate from God: and his power, when it is tried, reproveth the unwise.",
        "1:4": "For into a malicious soul wisdom shall not enter; nor dwell in the body that is subject unto sin.",
        "1:5": "For the holy spirit of discipline will flee deceit, and remove from thoughts that are without understanding, and will not abide when unrighteousness cometh in.",
        "1:6": "For wisdom is a loving spirit; and will not acquit a blasphemer of his words: for God is witness of his reins, and a true beholder of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue.",
        "1:7": "For the Spirit of the Lord filleth the world: and that which containeth all things hath knowledge of the voice.",
        "1:8": "Therefore he that speaketh unrighteous things cannot be hid: neither shall vengeance, when it punisheth, pass by him.",
        "1:9": "For inquisition shall be made into the counsels of the ungodly: and the sound of his words shall come unto the Lord for the manifestation of his wicked deeds.",
        "1:10": "For the ear of jealousy heareth all things: and the noise of murmurings is not hid.",
        "1:11": "Therefore beware of murmuring, which is unprofitable; and refrain your tongue from backbiting: for there is no word so secret, that shall go for nought: and the mouth that belieth slayeth the soul.",
        "1:12": "Seek not death in the error of your life: and pull not upon yourselves destruction with the works of your hands.",
        "1:13": "For God made not death: neither hath he pleasure in the destruction of the living.",
        "1:14": "For he created all things, that they might have their being: and the generations of the world were healthful; and there is no poison of destruction in them, nor the kingdom of death upon the earth:",
        "1:15": "(For righteousness is immortal:)",
        "1:16": "But ungodly men with their works and words called it to them: for when they thought to have it their friend, they consumed to nought, and made a covenant with it, because they are worthy to take part with it.",
        "2:1": "For the ungodly said, reasoning with themselves, but not aright, Our life is short and tedious, and in the death of a man there is no remedy: neither was there any man known to have returned from the grave.",
        "2:2": "For we are born at all adventure: and we shall be hereafter as though we had never been: for the breath in our nostrils is as smoke, and a little spark in the moving of our heart:",
        "2:3": "Which being extinguished, our body shall be turned into ashes, and our spirit shall vanish as the soft air,",
        "2:4": "And our name shall be forgotten in time, and no man shall have our works in remembrance, and our life shall pass away as the trace of a cloud, and shall be dispersed as a mist, that is driven away with the beams of the sun, and overcome with the heat thereof.",
        "2:5": "For our time is a very shadow that passeth away; and after our end there is no returning: for it is fast sealed, so that no man cometh again.",
        "2:6": "Come on therefore, let us enjoy the good things that are present: and let us speedily use the creatures like as in youth.",
        "2:7": "Let us fill ourselves with costly wine and ointments: and let no flower of the spring pass by us:",
        "2:8": "Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds, before they be withered:",
        "2:9": "Let none of us go without his part of our voluptuousness: let us leave tokens of our joyfulness in every place: for this is our portion, and our lot is this.",
        "2:10": "Let us oppress the poor righteous man, let us not spare the widow, nor reverence the ancient gray hairs of the aged.",
        "2:11": "Let our strength be the law of justice: for that which is feeble is found to be nothing worth.",
        "2:12": "Therefore let us lie in wait for the righteous; because he is not for our turn, and he is clean contrary to our doings: he upbraideth us with our offending the law, and objecteth to our infamy the transgressings of our education.",
        "2:13": "He professeth to have the knowledge of God: and he calleth himself the child of the Lord.",
        "2:14": "He was made to reprove our thoughts.",
        "2:15": "He is grievous unto us even to behold: for his life is not like other men’s, his ways are of another fashion.",
        "2:16": "We are esteemed of him as counterfeits: he abstaineth from our ways as from filthiness: he pronounceth the end of the just to be blessed, and maketh his boast that God is his father.",
        "2:17": "Let us see if his words be true: and let us prove what shall happen in the end of him.",
        "2:18": "For if the just man be the son of God, he will help him, and deliver him from the hand of his enemies.",
        "2:19": "Let us examine him with despitefulness and torture, that we may know his meekness, and prove his patience.",
        "2:20": "Let us condemn him with a shameful death: for by his own saying he shall be respected.",
        "2:21": "Such things they did imagine, and were deceived: for their own wickedness hath blinded them.",
        "2:22": "As for the mysteries of God, they kn ew them not: neither hoped they for the wages of righteousness, nor discerned a reward for blameless souls.",
        "2:23": "For God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of his own eternity.",
        "2:24": "Nevertheless through envy of the devil came death into the world: and they that do hold of his side do find it.",
        "3:1": "But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and there shall no torment touch them.",
        "3:2": "In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die: and their departure is taken for misery,",
        "3:3": "And their going from us to be utter destruction: but they are in peace.",
        "3:4": "For though they be punished in the sight of men, yet is their hope full of immortality.",
        "3:5": "And having been a little chastised, they shall be greatly rewarded: for God proved them, and found them worthy for himself.",
        "3:6": "As gold in the furnace hath he tried them, and received them as a burnt offering.",
        "3:7": "And in the time of their visitation they shall shine, and run to and fro like sparks among the stubble.",
        "3:8": "They shall judge the nations, and have dominion over the people, and their Lord shall reign for ever.",
        "3:9": "They that put their trust in him shall understand the truth: and such as be faithful in love shall abide with him: for grace and mercy is to his saints, and he hath care for his elect.",
        "3:10": "But the ungodly shall be punished according to their own imaginations, which have neglected the righteous, and forsaken the Lord.",
        "3:11": "For whoso despiseth wisdom and nurture, he is miserable, and their hope is vain, their labours unfruitful, and their works unprofitable:",
        "3:12": "Their wives are foolish, and their children wicked:",
        "3:13": "Their offspring is cursed. Wherefore blessed is the barren that is undefiled, which hath not known the sinful bed: she shall have fruit in the visitation of souls.",
        "3:14": "And blessed is the eunuch, which with his hands hath wrought no iniquity, nor imagined wicked things against God: for unto him shall be given the special gift of faith, and an inheritance in the temple of the Lord more acceptable to his mind.",
        "3:15": "For glorious is the fruit of good labours: and the root of wisdom shall never fall away.",
        "3:16": "As for the children of adulterers, they shall not come to their perfection, and the seed of an unrighteous bed shall be rooted out.",
        "3:17": "For though they live long, yet shall they be nothing regarded: and their last age shall be without honour.",
        "3:18": "Or, if they die quickly, they have no hope, neither comfort in the day of trial.",
        "3:19": "For horrible is the end of the unrighteous generation.",
        "4:1": "Better it is to have no children, and to have virtue: for the memorial thereof is immortal: because it is known with God, and with men.",
        "4:2": "When it is present, men take example at it; and when it is gone, they desire it: it weareth a crown, and triumpheth for ever, having gotten the victory, striving for undefiled rewards.",
        "4:3": "But the multiplying brood of the ungodly shall not thrive, nor take deep rooting from bastard slips, nor lay any fast foundation.",
        "4:4": "For though they flourish in branches for a time; yet standing not last, they shall be shaken with the wind, and through the force of winds they shall be rooted out.",
        "4:5": "The imperfect branches shall be broken off, their fruit unprofitable, not ripe to eat, yea, meet for nothing.",
        "4:6": "For children begotten of unlawful beds are witnesses of wickedness against their parents in their trial.",
        "4:7": "But though the righteous be prevented with death, yet shall he be in rest.",
        "4:8": "For honourable age is not that which standeth in length of time, nor that is measured by number of years.",
        "4:9": "But wisdom is the gray hair unto men, and an unspotted life is old age.",
        "4:10": "He pleased God, and was beloved of him: so that living among sinners he was translated.",
        "4:11": "Yea speedily was he taken away, lest that wickedness should alter his understanding, or deceit beguile his soul.",
        "4:12": "For the bewitching of naughtiness doth obscure things that are honest; and the wandering of concupiscence doth undermine the simple mind.",
        "4:13": "He, being made perfect in a short time, fulfilled a long time:",
        "4:14": "For his soul pleased the Lord: therefore hasted he to take him away from among the wicked.",
        "4:15": "This the people saw, and understood it not, neither laid they up this in their minds, That his grace and mercy is with his saints, and that he hath respect unto his chosen.",
        "4:16": "Thus the righteous that is dead shall condemn the ungodly which are living; and youth that is soon perfected the many years and old age of the unrighteous.",
        "4:17": "For they shall see the end of the wise, and shall not understand what God in his counsel hath decreed of him, and to what end the Lord hath set him in safety.",
        "4:18": "They shall see him, and despise him; but God shall laugh them to scorn: and they shall hereafter be a vile carcase, and a reproach among the dead for evermore.",
        "4:19": "For he shall rend them, and cast them down headlong, that they shall be speechless; and he shall shake them from the foundation; and they shall be utterly laid waste, and be in sorrow; and their memorial shall perish.",
        "4:20": "And when they cast up the accounts of their sins, they shall come with fear: and their own iniquities shall convince them to their face.",
        "5:1": "Then shall the righteous man stand in great boldness before the face of such as have afflicted him, and made no account of his labours.",
        "5:2": "When they see it, they shall be troubled with terrible fear, and shall be amazed at the strangeness of his salvation, so far beyond all that they looked for.",
        "5:3": "And they repenting and groaning for anguish of spirit shall say within themselves, This was he, whom we had sometimes in derision, and a proverb of reproach:",
        "5:4": "We fools accounted his life madness, and his end to be without honour:",
        "5:5": "How is he numbered among the children of God, and his lot is among the saints!",
        "5:6": "Therefore have we erred from the way of truth, and the light of righteousness hath not shined unto us, and the sun of righteousness rose not upon us.",
        "5:7": "We wearied ourselves in the way of wickedness and destruction: yea, we have gone through deserts, where there lay no way: but as for the way of the Lord, we have not known it.",
        "5:8": "What hath pride profited us? or what good hath riches with our vaunting brought us?",
        "5:9": "All those things are passed away like a shadow, and as a post that hasted by;",
        "5:10": "And as a ship that passeth over the waves of the water, which when it is gone by, the trace thereof cannot be found, neither the pathway of the keel in the waves;",
        "5:11": "Or as when a bird hath flown through the air, there is no token of her way to be found, but the light air being beaten with the stroke of her wings and parted with the violent noise and motion of them, is passed through, and therein afterwards no sign where she went is to be found;",
        "5:12": "Or like as when an arrow is shot at a mark, it parteth the air, which immediately cometh together again, so that a man cannot know where it went through:",
        "5:13": "Even so we in like manner, as soon as we were born, began to draw to our end, and had no sign of virtue to shew; but were consumed in our own wickedness.",
        "5:14": "For the hope of the Godly is like dust that is blown away with the wind; like a thin froth that is driven away with the storm; like as the smoke which is dispersed here and there with a tempest, and passeth away as the remembrance of a guest that tarrieth but a day.",
        "5:15": "But the righteous live for evermore; their reward also is with the Lord, and the care of them is with the most High.",
        "5:16": "Therefore shall they receive a glorious kingdom, and a beautiful crown from the Lord’s hand: for with his right hand shall he cover them, and with his arm shall he protect them.",
        "5:17": "He shall take to him his jealousy for complete armour, and make the creature his weapon for the revenge of his enemies.",
        "5:18": "He shall put on righteousness as a breastplate, and true judgment instead of an helmet.",
        "5:19": "He shall take holiness for an invincible shield.",
        "5:20": "His severe wrath shall he sharpen for a sword, and the world shall fight with him against the unwise.",
        "5:21": "Then shall the right aiming thunderbolts go abroad; and from the clouds, as from a well drawn bow, shall they fly to the mark.",
        "5:22": "And hailstones full of wrath shall be cast as out of a stone bow, and the water of the sea shall rage against them, and the floods shall cruelly drown them.",
        "5:23": "Yea, a mighty wind shall stand up against them, and like a storm shall blow them away: thus iniquity shall lay waste the whole earth, and ill dealing shall overthrow the thrones of the mighty.",
        "6:1": "Hear therefore, O ye kings, and understand; learn, ye that be judges of the ends of the earth.",
        "6:2": "Give ear, ye that rule the people, and glory in the multitude of nations.",
        "6:3": "For power is given you of the Lord, and sovereignty from the Highest, who shall try your works, and search out your counsels.",
        "6:4": "Because, being ministers of his kingdom, ye have not judged aright, nor kept the law, nor walked after the counsel of God;",
        "6:5": "Horribly and speedily shall he come upon you: for a sharp judgment shall be to them that be in high places.",
        "6:6": "For mercy will soon pardon the meanest: but mighty men shall be mightily tormented.",
        "6:7": "For he which is Lord over all shall fear no man’s person, neither shall he stand in awe of any man’s greatness: for he hath made the small and great, and careth for all alike.",
        "6:8": "But a sore trial shall come upon the mighty.",
        "6:9": "Unto you therefore, O kings, do I speak, that ye may learn wisdom, and not fall away.",
        "6:10": "For they that keep holiness holily shall be judged holy: and they that have learned such things shall find what to answer.",
        "6:11": "Wherefore set your affection upon my words; desire them, and ye shall be instructed.",
        "6:12": "Wisdom is glorious, and never fadeth away: yea, she is easily seen of them that love her, and found of such as seek her.",
        "6:13": "She preventeth them that desire her, in making herself first known unto them.",
        "6:14": "Whoso seeketh her early shall have no great travail: for he shall find her sitting at his doors.",
        "6:15": "To think therefore upon her is perfection of wisdom: and whoso watcheth for her shall quickly be without care.",
        "6:16": "For she goeth about seeking such as are worthy of her, sheweth herself favourably unto them in the ways, and meeteth them in every thought.",
        "6:17": "For the very true beginning of her is the desire of discipline; and the care of discipline is love;",
        "6:18": "And love is the keeping of her laws; and the giving heed unto her laws is the assurance of incorruption;",
        "6:19": "And incorruption maketh us near unto God:",
        "6:20": "Therefore the desire of wisdom bringeth to a kingdom.",
        "6:21": "If your delight be then in thrones and sceptres, O ye kings of the people, honour wisdom, that ye may reign for evermore.",
        "6:22": "As for wisdom, what she is, and how she came up, I will tell you, and will not hide mysteries from you: but will seek her out from the beginning of her nativity, and bring the knowledge of her into light, and will not pass over the truth.",
        "6:23": "Neither will I go with consuming envy; for such a man shall have no fellowship with wisdom.",
        "6:24": "But the multitude of the wise is the welfare of the world: and a wise king is the upholding of the people.",
        "6:25": "Receive therefore instruction through my words, and it shall do you good.",
        "7:1": "I myself also am a mortal man, like to all, and the offspring of him that was first made of the earth,",
        "7:2": "And in my mother’s womb was fashioned to be flesh in the time of ten months, being compacted in blood, of the seed of man, and the pleasure that came with sleep.",
        "7:3": "And when I was born, I drew in the common air, and fell upon the earth, which is of like nature, and the first voice which I uttered was crying, as all others do.",
        "7:4": "I was nursed in swaddling clothes, and that with cares.",
        "7:5": "For there is no king that had any other beginning of birth.",
        "7:6": "For all men have one entrance into life, and the like going out.",
        "7:7": "Wherefore I prayed, and understanding was given me: I called upon God, and the spirit of wisdom came to me.",
        "7:8": "I preferred her before sceptres and thrones, and esteemed riches nothing in comparison of her.",
        "7:9": "Neither compared I unto her any precious stone, because all gold in respect of her is as a little sand, and silver shall be counted as clay before her.",
        "7:10": "I loved her above health and beauty, and chose to have her instead of light: for the light that cometh from her never goeth out.",
        "7:11": "All good things together came to me with her, and innumerable riches in her hands.",
        "7:12": "And I rejoiced in them all, because wisdom goeth before them: and I knew not that she was the mother of them.",
        "7:13": "I learned diligently, and do communicate her liberally: I do not hide her riches.",
        "7:14": "For she is a treasure unto men that never faileth: which they that use become the friends of God, being commended for the gifts that come from learning.",
        "7:15": "God hath granted me to speak as I would, and to conceive as is meet for the things that are given me: because it is he that leadeth unto wisdom, and directeth the wise.",
        "7:16": "For in his hand are both we and our words; all wisdom also, and knowledge of workmanship.",
        "7:17": "For he hath given me certain knowledge of the things that are, namely, to know how the world was made, and the operation of the elements:",
        "7:18": "The beginning, ending, and midst of the times: the alterations of the turning of the sun, and the change of seasons:",
        "7:19": "The circuits of years, and the positions of stars:",
        "7:20": "The natures of living creatures, and the furies of wild beasts: the violence of winds, and the reasonings of men: the diversities of plants and the virtues of roots:",
        "7:21": "And all such things as are either secret or manifest, them I know.",
        "7:22": "For wisdom, which is the worker of all things, taught me: for in her is an understanding spirit holy, one only, manifold, subtil, lively, clear, undefiled, plain, not subject to hurt, loving the thing that is good quick, which cannot be letted, ready to do good,",
        "7:23": "Kind to man, steadfast, sure, free from care, having all power, overseeing all things, and going through all understanding, pure, and most subtil, spirits.",
        "7:24": "For wisdom is more moving than any motion: she passeth and goeth through all things by reason of her pureness.",
        "7:25": "For she is the breath of the power of God, and a pure influence flowing from the glory of the Almighty: therefore can no defiled thing fall into her.",
        "7:26": "For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness.",
        "7:27": "And being but one, she can do all things: and remaining in herself, she maketh all things new: and in all ages entering into holy souls, she maketh them friends of God, and prophets.",
        "7:28": "For God loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom.",
        "7:29": "For she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the order of stars: being compared with the light, she is found before it.",
        "7:30": "For after this cometh night: but vice shall not prevail against wisdom.",
        "8:1": "Wisdom reacheth from one end to another mightily: and sweetly doth she order all things.",
        "8:2": "I loved her, and sought her out from my youth, I desired to make her my spouse, and I was a lover of her beauty.",
        "8:3": "In that she is conversant with God, she magnifieth her nobility: yea, the Lord of all things himself loved her.",
        "8:4": "For she is privy to the mysteries of the knowledge of God, and a lover of his works.",
        "8:5": "If riches be a possession to be desired in this life; what is richer than wisdom, that worketh all things?",
        "8:6": "And if prudence work; who of all that are is a more cunning workman than she?",
        "8:7": "And if a man love righteousness her labours are virtues: for she teacheth temperance and prudence, justice and fortitude: which are such things, as en can have nothing more profitable in their life.",
        "8:8": "If a man desire much experience, she knoweth things of old, and conjectureth aright what is to come: she knoweth the subtilties of speeches, and can expound dark sentences: she foreseeth signs and wonders, and the events of seasons and times.",
        "8:9": "Therefore I purposed to take her to me to live with me, knowing that she would be a counsellor of good things, and a comfort in cares and grief.",
        "8:10": "For her sake I shall have estimation among the multitude, and honour with the elders, though I be young.",
        "8:11": "I shall be found of a quick conceit in judgment, and shall be admired in the sight of great men.",
        "8:12": "When I hold my tongue, they shall bide my leisure, and when I speak, they shall give good ear unto me: if I talk much, they shall lay their hands upon their mouth.",
        "8:13": "Moreover by the means of her I shall obtain immortality, and leave behind me an everlasting memorial to them that come after me.",
        "8:14": "I shall set the people in order, and the nations shall be subject unto me.",
        "8:15": "Horrible tyrants shall be afraid, when they do but hear of me; I shall be found good among the multitude, and valiant in war.",
        "8:16": "After I am come into mine house, I will repose myself with her: for her conversation hath no bitterness; and to live with her hath no sorrow, but mirth and joy.",
        "8:17": "Now when I considered these things in myself, and pondered them in my heart, how that to be allied unto wisdom is immortality;",
        "8:18": "And great pleasure it is to have her friendship; and in the works of her hands are infinite riches; and in the exercise of conference with her, prudence; and in talking with her, a good report; I went about seeking how to take her to me.",
        "8:19": "For I was a witty child, and had a good spirit.",
        "8:20": "Yea rather, being good, I came into a body undefiled.",
        "8:21": "Nevertheless, when I perceived that I could not otherwise obtain her, except God gave her me; and that was a point of wisdom also to know whose gift she was; I prayed unto the Lord, and besought him, and with my whole heart I said,",
        "9:1": "O God of my fathers, and Lord of mercy, who hast made all things with thy word,",
        "9:2": "And ordained man through thy wisdom, that he should have dominion over the creatures which thou hast made,",
        "9:3": "And order the world according to equity and righteousness, and execute judgment with an upright heart:",
        "9:4": "Give me wisdom, that sitteth by thy throne; and reject me not from among thy children:",
        "9:5": "For I thy servant and son of thine handmaid am a feeble person, and of a short time, and too young for the understanding of judgment and laws.",
        "9:6": "For though a man be never so perfect among the children of men, yet if thy wisdom be not with him, he shall be nothing regarded.",
        "9:7": "Thou hast chosen me to be a king of thy people, and a judge of thy sons and daughters:",
        "9:8": "Thou hast commanded me to build a temple upon thy holy mount, and an altar in the city wherein thou dwellest, a resemblance of the holy tabernacle, which thou hast prepared from the beginning.",
        "9:9": "And wisdom was with thee: which knoweth thy works, and was present when thou madest the world, and knew what was acceptable in thy sight, and right in thy commandments.",
        "9:10": "O send her out of thy holy heavens, and from the throne of thy glory, that being present she may labour with me, that I may know what is pleasing unto thee.",
        "9:11": "For she knoweth and understandeth all things, and she shall lead me soberly in my doings, and preserve me in her power.",
        "9:12": "So shall my works be acceptable, and then shall I judge thy people righteously, and be worthy to sit in my father’s seat.",
        "9:13": "For what man is he that can know the counsel of God? or who can think what the will of the Lord is?",
        "9:14": "For the thoughts of mortal men are miserable, and our devices are but uncertain.",
        "9:15": "For the corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the earthy tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things.",
        "9:16": "And hardly do we guess aright at things that are upon earth, and with labour do we find the things that are before us: but the things that are in heaven who hath searched out?",
        "9:17": "And thy counsel who hath known, except thou give wisdom, and send thy Holy Spirit from above?",
        "9:18": "For so the ways of them which lived on the earth were reformed, and men were taught the things that are pleasing unto thee, and were saved through wisdom.",
        "10:1": "She preserved the first formed father of the world, that was created alone, and brought him out of his fall,",
        "10:2": "And gave him power to rule all things.",
        "10:3": "But when the unrighteous went away from her in his anger, he perished also in the fury wherewith he murdered his brother.",
        "10:4": "For whose cause the earth being drowned with the flood, wisdom again preserved it, and directed the course of the righteous in a piece of wood of small value.",
        "10:5": "Moreover, the nations in their wicked conspiracy being confounded, she found out the righteous, and preserved him blameless unto God, and kept him strong against his tender compassion toward his son.",
        "10:6": "When the ungodly perished, she delivered the righteous man, who fled from the fire which fell down upon the five cities.",
        "10:7": "Of whose wickedness even to this day the waste land that smoketh is a testimony, and plants bearing fruit that never come to ripeness: and a standing pillar of salt is a monument of an unbelieving soul.",
        "10:8": "For regarding not wisdom, they gat not only this hurt, that they knew not the things which were good; but also left behind them to the world a memorial of their foolishness: so that in the things wherein they offended they could not so much as be hid.",
        "10:9": "But wisdom delivered from pain those that attended upon her.",
        "10:10": "When the righteous fled from his brother’s wrath she guided him in right paths, shewed him the kingdom of God, and gave him knowledge of holy things, made him rich in his travels, and multiplied the fruit of his labours.",
        "10:11": "In the covetousness of such as oppressed him she stood by him, and made him rich.",
        "10:12": "She defended him from his enemies, and kept him safe from those that lay in wait, and in a sore conflict she gave him the victory; that he might know that goodness is stronger than all.",
        "10:13": "When the righteous was sold, she forsook him not, but delivered him from sin: she went down with him into the pit,",
        "10:14": "And left him not in bonds, till she brought him the sceptre of the kingdom, and power against those that oppressed him: as for them that had accused him, she shewed them to be liars, and gave him perpetual glory.",
        "10:15": "She delivered the righteous people and blameless seed from the nation that oppressed them.",
        "10:16": "She entered into the soul of the servant of the Lord, and withstood dreadful kings in wonders and signs;",
        "10:17": "Rendered to the righteous a reward of their labours, guided them in a marvellous way, and was unto them for a cover by day, and a light of stars in the night season;",
        "10:18": "Brought them through the Red sea, and led them through much water:",
        "10:19": "But she drowned their enemies, and cast them up out of the bottom of the deep.",
        "10:20": "Therefore the righteous spoiled the ungodly, and praised thy holy name, O Lord, and magnified with one accord thine hand, that fought for them.",
        "10:21": "For wisdom opened the mouth of the dumb, and made the tongues of them that cannot speak eloquent.",
        "11:1": "She prospered their works in the hand of the holy prophet.",
        "11:2": "They went through the wilderness that was not inhabited, and pitched tents in places where there lay no way.",
        "11:3": "They stood against their enemies, and were avenged of their adversaries.",
        "11:4": "When they were thirsty, they called upon thee, and water was given them out of the flinty rock, and their thirst was quenched out of the hard stone.",
        "11:5": "For by what things their enemies were punished, by the same they in their need were benefited.",
        "11:6": "For instead of a perpetual running river troubled with foul blood,",
        "11:7": "For a manifest reproof of that commandment, whereby the infants were slain, thou gavest unto them abundance of water by a means which they hoped not for:",
        "11:8": "Declaring by that thirst then how thou hadst punished their adversaries.",
        "11:9": "For when they were tried albeit but in mercy chastised, they knew how the ungodly were judged in wrath and tormented, thirsting in another manner than the just.",
        "11:10": "For these thou didst admonish and try, as a father: but the other, as a severe king, thou didst condemn and punish.",
        "11:11": "Whether they were absent or present, they were vexed alike.",
        "11:12": "For a double grief came upon them, and a groaning for the remembrance of things past.",
        "11:13": "For when they heard by their own punishments the other to be benefited, they had some feeling of the Lord.",
        "11:14": "For whom they respected with scorn, when he was long before thrown out at the casting forth of the infants, him in the end, when they saw what came to pass, they admired.",
        "11:15": "But for the foolish devices of their wickedness, wherewith being deceived they worshipped serpents void of reason, and vile beasts, thou didst send a multitude of unreasonable beasts upon them for vengeance;",
        "11:16": "That they might know, that wherewithal a man sinneth, by the same also shall he be punished.",
        "11:17": "For thy Almighty hand, that made the world of matter without form, wanted not means to send among them a multitude of bears or fierce lions,",
        "11:18": "Or unknown wild beasts, full of rage, newly created, breathing out either a fiery vapour, or filthy scents of scattered smoke, or shooting horrible sparkles out of their eyes:",
        "11:19": "Whereof not only the harm might dispatch them at once, but also the terrible sight utterly destroy them.",
        "11:20": "Yea, and without these might they have fallen down with one blast, being persecuted of vengeance, and scattered abroad through the breath of thy power: but thou hast ordered all things in measure and number and weight.",
        "11:21": "For thou canst shew thy great strength at all times when thou wilt; and who may withstand the power of thine arm?",
        "11:22": "For the whole world before thee is as a little grain of the balance, yea, as a drop of the morning dew that falleth down upon the earth.",
        "11:23": "But thou hast mercy upon all; for thou canst do all things, and winkest at the sins of men, because they should amend.",
        "11:24": "For thou lovest all the things that are, and abhorrest nothing which thou hast made: for never wouldest thou have made any thing, if thou hadst hated it.",
        "11:25": "And how could any thing have endured, if it had not been thy will? or been preserved, if not called by thee?",
        "11:26": "But thou sparest all: for they are thine, O Lord, thou lover of souls.",
        "12:1": "For thine incorruptible Spirit is in all things.",
        "12:2": "Therefore chastenest thou them by little and little that offend, and warnest them by putting them in remembrance wherein they have offended, that leaving their wickedness they may believe on thee, O Lord.",
        "12:3": "For it was thy will to destroy by the hands of our fathers both those old inhabitants of thy holy land,",
        "12:4": "Whom thou hatedst for doing most odious works of witchcrafts, and wicked sacrifices;",
        "12:5": "And also those merciless murderers of children, and devourers of man’s flesh, and the feasts of blood,",
        "12:6": "With their priests out of the midst of their idolatrous crew, and the parents, that killed with their own hands souls destitute of help:",
        "12:7": "That the land, which thou esteemedst above all other, might receive a worthy colony of God’s children.",
        "12:8": "Nevertheless even those thou sparedst as men, and didst send wasps, forerunners of thine host, to destroy them by little and little.",
        "12:9": "Not that thou wast unable to bring the ungodly under the hand of the righteous in battle, or to destroy them at once with cruel beasts, or with one rough word:",
        "12:10": "But executing thy judgments upon them by little and little, thou gavest them place of repentance, not being ignorant that they were a naughty generation, and that their malice was bred in them, and that their cogitation would never be changed.",
        "12:11": "For it was a cursed seed from the beginning; neither didst thou for fear of any man give them pardon for those things wherein they sinned.",
        "12:12": "For who shall say, What hast thou done? or who shall withstand thy judgment? or who shall accuse thee for the nations that perish, whom thou made? or who shall come to stand against thee, to be revenged for the unrighteous men?",
        "12:13": "For neither is there any God but thou that careth for all, to whom thou mightest shew that thy judgment is not unright.",
        "12:14": "Neither shall king or tyrant be able to set his face against thee for any whom thou hast punished.",
        "12:15": "Forsomuch then as thou art righteous thyself, thou orderest all things righteously: thinking it not agreeable with thy power to condemn him that hath not deserved to be punished.",
        "12:16": "For thy power is the beginning of righteousness, and because thou art the Lord of all, it maketh thee to be gracious unto all.",
        "12:17": "For when men will not believe that thou art of a full power, thou shewest thy strength, and among them that know it thou makest their boldness manifest.",
        "12:18": "But thou, mastering thy power, judgest with equity, and orderest us with great favour: for thou mayest use power when thou wilt.",
        "12:19": "But by such works hast thou taught thy people that the just man should be merciful, and hast made thy children to be of a good hope that thou givest repentance for sins.",
        "12:20": "For if thou didst punish the enemies of thy children, and the condemned to death, with such deliberation, giving them time and place, whereby they might be delivered from their malice:",
        "12:21": "With how great circumspection didst thou judge thine own sons, unto whose fathers thou hast sworn, and made covenants of good promises?",
        "12:22": "Therefore, whereas thou dost chasten us, thou scourgest our enemies a thousand times more, to the intent that, when we judge, we should carefully think of thy goodness, and when we ourselves are judged, we should look for mercy.",
        "12:23": "Wherefore, whereas men have lived dissolutely and unrighteously, thou hast tormented them with their own abominations.",
        "12:24": "For they went astray very far in the ways of error, and held them for gods, which even among the beasts of their enemies were despised, being deceived, as children of no understanding.",
        "12:25": "Therefore unto them, as to children without the use of reason, thou didst send a judgment to mock them.",
        "12:26": "But they that would not be reformed by that correction, wherein he dallied with them, shall feel a judgment worthy of God.",
        "12:27": "For, look, for what things they grudged, when they were punished, that is, for them whom they thought to be gods; now being punished in them, when they saw it, they acknowledged him to be the true God, whom before they denied to know: and therefore came extreme damnation upon them.",
        "13:1": "Surely vain are all men by nature, who are ignorant of God, and could not out of the good things that are seen know him that is: neither by considering the works did they acknowledge the workmaster;",
        "13:2": "But deemed either fire, or wind, or the swift air, or the circle of the stars, or the violent water, or the lights of heaven, to be the gods which govern the world.",
        "13:3": "With whose beauty if they being delighted took them to be gods; let them know how much better the Lord of them is: for the first author of beauty hath created them.",
        "13:4": "But if they were astonished at their power and virtue, let them understand by them, how much mightier he is that made them.",
        "13:5": "For by the greatness and beauty of the creatures proportionably the maker of them is seen.",
        "13:6": "But yet for this they are the less to be blamed: for they peradventure err, seeking God, and desirous to find him.",
        "13:7": "For being conversant in his works they search him diligently, and believe their sight: because the things are beautiful that are seen.",
        "13:8": "Howbeit neither are they to be pardoned.",
        "13:9": "For if they were able to know so much, that they could aim at the world; how did they not sooner find out the Lord thereof?",
        "13:10": "But miserable are they, and in dead things is their hope, who call them gods, which are the works of men’s hands, gold and silver, to shew art in, and resemblances of beasts, or a stone good for nothing, the work of an ancient hand.",
        "13:11": "Now a carpenter that felleth timber, after he hath sawn down a tree meet for the purpose, and taken off all the bark skilfully round about, and hath wrought it handsomely, and made a vessel thereof fit for the service of man’s life;",
        "13:12": "And after spending the refuse of his work to dress his meat, hath filled himself;",
        "13:13": "And taking the very refuse among those which served to no use, being a crooked piece of wood, and full of knots, hath carved it diligently, when he had nothing else to do, and formed it by the skill of his understanding, and fashioned it to the image of a man;",
        "13:14": "Or made it like some vile beast, laying it over with vermilion, and with paint colouring it red, and covering every spot therein;",
        "13:15": "And when he had made a convenient room for it, set it in a wall, and made it fast with iron:",
        "13:16": "For he provided for it that it might not fall, knowing that it was unable to help itself; for it is an image, and hath need of help:",
        "13:17": "Then maketh he prayer for his goods, for his wife and children, and is not ashamed to speak to that which hath no life.",
        "13:18": "For health he calleth upon that which is weak: for life prayeth to that which is dead; for aid humbly beseecheth that which hath least means to help: and for a good journey he asketh of that which cannot set a foot forward:",
        "13:19": "And for gaining and getting, and for good success of his hands, asketh ability to do of him, that is most unable to do any thing.",
        "14:1": "Again, one preparing himself to sail, and about to pass through the raging waves, calleth upon a piece of wood more rotten than the vessel that carrieth him.",
        "14:2": "For verily desire of gain devised that, and the workman built it by his skill.",
        "14:3": "But thy providence, O Father, governeth it: for thou hast made a way in the sea, and a safe path in the waves;",
        "14:4": "Shewing that thou canst save from all danger: yea, though a man went to sea without art.",
        "14:5": "Nevertheless thou wouldest not that the works of thy wisdom should be idle, and therefore do men commit their lives to a small piece of wood, and passing the rough sea in a weak vessel are saved.",
        "14:6": "For in the old time also, when the proud giants perished, the hope of the world governed by thy hand escaped in a weak vessel, and left to all ages a seed of generation.",
        "14:7": "For blessed is the wood whereby righteousness cometh.",
        "14:8": "But that which is made with hands is cursed, as well it, as he that made it: he, because he made it; and it, because, being corruptible, it was called god.",
        "14:9": "For the ungodly and his ungodliness are both alike hateful unto God.",
        "14:10": "For that which is made shall be punished together with him that made it.",
        "14:11": "Therefore even upon the idols of the Gentiles shall there be a visitation: because in the creature of God they are become an abomination, and stumblingblocks to the souls of men, and a snare to the feet of the unwise.",
        "14:12": "For the devising of idols was the beginning of spiritual fornication, and the invention of them the corruption of life.",
        "14:13": "For neither were they from the beginning, neither shall they be for ever.",
        "14:14": "For by the vain glory of men they entered into the world, and therefore shall they come shortly to an end.",
        "14:15": "For a father afflicted with untimely mourning, when he hath made an image of his child soon taken away, now honoured him as a god, which was then a dead man, and delivered to those that were under him ceremonies and sacrifices.",
        "14:16": "Thus in process of time an ungodly custom grown strong was kept as a law, and graven images were worshipped by the commandments of kings.",
        "14:17": "Whom men could not honour in presence, because they dwelt far off, they took the counterfeit of his visage from far, and made an express image of a king whom they honoured, to the end that by this their forwardness they might flatter him that was absent, as if he were present.",
        "14:18": "Also the singular diligence of the artificer did help to set forward the ignorant to more superstition.",
        "14:19": "For he, peradventure willing to please one in authority, forced all his skill to make the resemblance of the best fashion.",
        "14:20": "And so the multitude, allured by the grace of the work, took him now for a god, which a little before was but honoured.",
        "14:21": "And this was an occasion to deceive the world: for men, serving either calamity or tyranny, did ascribe unto stones and stocks the incommunicable name.",
        "14:22": "Moreover this was not enough for them, that they erred in the knowledge of God; but whereas they lived in the great war of ignorance, those so great plagues called they peace.",
        "14:23": "For whilst they slew their children in sacrifices, or used secret ceremonies, or made revellings of strange rites;",
        "14:24": "They kept neither lives nor marriages any longer undefiled: but either one slew another traiterously, or grieved him by adultery.",
        "14:25": "So that there reigned in all men without exception blood, manslaughter, theft, and dissimulation, corruption, unfaithfulness, tumults, perjury,",
        "14:26": "Disquieting of good men, forgetfulness of good turns, defiling of souls, changing of kind, disorder in marriages, adultery, and shameless uncleanness.",
        "14:27": "For the worshipping of idols not to be named is the beginning, the cause, and the end, of all evil.",
        "14:28": "For either they are mad when they be merry, or prophesy lies, or live unjustly, or else lightly forswear themselves.",
        "14:29": "For insomuch as their trust is in idols, which have no life; though they swear falsely, yet they look not to be hurt.",
        "14:30": "Howbeit for both causes shall they be justly punished: both because they thought not well of God, giving heed unto idols, and also unjustly swore in deceit, despising holiness.",
        "14:31": "For it is not the power of them by whom they swear: but it is the just vengeance of sinners, that punisheth always the offence of the ungodly.",
        "15:1": "But thou, O God, art gracious and true, longsuffering, and in mercy ordering all things,",
        "15:2": "For if we sin, we are thine, knowing thy power: but we will not sin, knowing that we are counted thine.",
        "15:3": "For to know thee is perfect righteousness: yea, to know thy power is the root of immortality.",
        "15:4": "For neither did the mischievous invention of men deceive us, nor an image spotted with divers colours, the painter’s fruitless labour;",
        "15:5": "The sight whereof enticeth fools to lust after it, and so they desire the form of a dead image, that hath no breath.",
        "15:6": "Both they that make them, they that desire them, and they that worship them, are lovers of evil things, and are worthy to have such things to trust upon.",
        "15:7": "For the potter, tempering soft earth, fashioneth every vessel with much labour for our service: yea, of the same clay he maketh both the vessels that serve for clean uses, and likewise also all such as serve to the contrary: but what is the use of either sort, the potter himself is the judge.",
        "15:8": "And employing his labours lewdly, he maketh a vain god of the same clay, even he which a little before was made of earth himself, and within a little while after returneth to the same, out when his life which was lent him shall be demanded.",
        "15:9": "Notwithstanding his care is, not that he shall have much labour, nor that his life is short: but striveth to excel goldsmiths and silversmiths, and endeavoureth to do like the workers in brass, and counteth it his glory to make counterfeit things.",
        "15:10": "His heart is ashes, his hope is more vile than earth, and his life of less value than clay:",
        "15:11": "Forasmuch as he knew not his Maker, and him that inspired into him an active soul, and breathed in a living spirit.",
        "15:12": "But they counted our life a pastime, and our time here a market for gain: for, say they, we must be getting every way, though it be by evil means.",
        "15:13": "For this man, that of earthly matter maketh brittle vessels and graven images, knoweth himself to offend above all others.",
        "15:14": "And all the enemies of thy people, that hold them in subjection, are most foolish, and are more miserable than very babes.",
        "15:15": "For they counted all the idols of the heathen to be gods: which neither have the use of eyes to see, nor noses to draw breath, nor ears to hear, nor fingers of hands to handle; and as for their feet, they are slow to go.",
        "15:16": "For man made them, and he that borrowed his own spirit fashioned them: but no man can make a god like unto himself.",
        "15:17": "For being mortal, he worketh a dead thing with wicked hands: for he himself is better than the things which he worshippeth: whereas he lived once, but they never.",
        "15:18": "Yea, they worshipped those beasts also that are most hateful: for being compared together, some are worse than others.",
        "15:19": "Neither are they beautiful, so much as to be desired in respect of beasts: but they went without the praise of God and his blessing.",
        "16:1": "Therefore by the like were they punished worthily, and by the multitude of beasts tormented.",
        "16:2": "Instead of which punishment, dealing graciously with thine own people, thou preparedst for them meat of a strange taste, even quails to stir up their appetite:",
        "16:3": "To the end that they, desiring food, might for the ugly sight of the beasts sent among them lothe even that, which they must needs desire; but these, suffering penury for a short space, might be made partakers of a strange taste.",
        "16:4": "For it was requisite, that upon them exercising tyranny should come penury, which they could not avoid: but to these it should only be shewed how their enemies were tormented.",
        "16:5": "For when the horrible fierceness of beasts came upon these, and they perished with the stings of crooked serpents, thy wrath endured not for ever:",
        "16:6": "But they were troubled for a small season, that they might be admonished, having a sign of salvation, to put them in remembrance of the commandment of thy law.",
        "16:7": "For he that turned himself toward it was not saved by the thing that he saw, but by thee, that art the Saviour of all.",
        "16:8": "And in this thou madest thine enemies confess, that it is thou who deliverest from all evil:",
        "16:9": "For them the bitings of grasshoppers and flies killed, neither was there found any remedy for their life: for they were worthy to be punished by such.",
        "16:10": "But thy sons not the very teeth of venomous dragons overcame: for thy mercy was ever by them, and healed them.",
        "16:11": "For they were pricked, that they should remember thy words; and were quickly saved, that not falling into deep forgetfulness, they might be continually mindful of thy goodness.",
        "16:12": "For it was neither herb, nor mollifying plaister, that restored them to health: but thy word, O Lord, which healeth all things.",
        "16:13": "For thou hast power of life and death: thou leadest to the gates of hell, and bringest up again.",
        "16:14": "A man indeed killeth through his malice: and the spirit, when it is gone forth, returneth not; neither the soul received up cometh again.",
        "16:15": "But it is not possible to escape thine hand.",
        "16:16": "For the ungodly, that denied to know thee, were scourged by the strength of thine arm: with strange rains, hails, and showers, were they persecuted, that they could not avoid, and through fire were they consumed.",
        "16:17": "For, which is most to be wondered at, the fire had more force in the water, that quencheth all things: for the world fighteth for the righteous.",
        "16:18": "For sometime the flame was mitigated, that it might not burn up the beasts that were sent against the ungodly; but themselves might see and perceive that they were persecuted with the judgment of God.",
        "16:19": "And at another time it burneth even in the midst of water above the power of fire, that it might destroy the fruits of an unjust land.",
        "16:20": "Instead whereof thou feddest thine own people with angels’ food, and didst send them from heaven bread prepared without their labour, able to content every man’s delight, and agreeing to every taste.",
        "16:21": "For thy sustenance declared thy sweetness unto thy children, and serving to the appetite of the eater, tempered itself to every man’s liking.",
        "16:22": "But snow and ice endured the fire, and melted not, that they might know that fire burning in the hail, and sparkling in the rain, did destroy the fruits of the enemies.",
        "16:23": "But this again did even forget his own strength, that the righteous might be nourished.",
        "16:24": "For the creature that serveth thee, who art the Maker increaseth his strength against the unrighteous for their punishment, and abateth his strength for the benefit of such as put their trust in thee.",
        "16:25": "Therefore even then was it altered into all fashions, and was obedient to thy grace, that nourisheth all things, according to the desire of them that had need:",
        "16:26": "That thy children, O Lord, whom thou lovest, might know, that it is not the growing of fruits that nourisheth man: but that it is thy word, which preserveth them that put their trust in thee.",
        "16:27": "For that which was not destroyed of the fire, being warmed with a little sunbeam, soon melted away:",
        "16:28": "That it might be known, that we must prevent the sun to give thee thanks, and at the dayspring pray unto thee.",
        "16:29": "For the hope of the unthankful shall melt away as the winter’s hoar frost, and shall run away as unprofitable water.",
        "17:1": "For great are thy judgments, and cannot be expressed: therefore unnurtured souls have erred.",
        "17:2": "For when unrighteous men thought to oppress the holy nation; they being shut up in their houses, the prisoners of darkness, and fettered with the bonds of a long night, lay there exiled from the eternal providence.",
        "17:3": "For while they supposed to lie hid in their secret sins, they were scattered under a dark veil of forgetfulness, being horribly astonished, and troubled with strange apparitions.",
        "17:4": "For neither might the corner that held them keep them from fear: but noises as of waters falling down sounded about them, and sad visions appeared unto them with heavy countenances.",
        "17:5": "No power of the fire might give them light: neither could the bright flames of the stars endure to lighten that horrible night.",
        "17:6": "Only there appeared unto them a fire kindled of itself, very dreadful: for being much terrified, they thought the things which they saw to be worse than the sight they saw not.",
        "17:7": "As for the illusions of art magick, they were put down, and their vaunting in wisdom was reproved with disgrace.",
        "17:8": "For they, that promised to drive away terrors and troubles from a sick soul, were sick themselves of fear, worthy to be laughed at.",
        "17:9": "For though no terrible thing did fear them; yet being scared with beasts that passed by, and hissing of serpents,",
        "17:10": "They died for fear, denying that they saw the air, which could of no side be avoided.",
        "17:11": "For wickedness, condemned by her own witness, is very timorous, and being pressed with conscience, always forecasteth grievous things.",
        "17:12": "For fear is nothing else but a betraying of the succours which reason offereth.",
        "17:13": "And the expectation from within, being less, counteth the ignorance more than the cause which bringeth the torment.",
        "17:14": "But they sleeping the same sleep that night, which was indeed intolerable, and which came upon them out of the bottoms of inevitable hell,",
        "17:15": "Were partly vexed with monstrous apparitions, and partly fainted, their heart failing them: for a sudden fear, and not looked for, came upon them.",
        "17:16": "So then whosoever there fell down was straitly kept, shut up in a prison without iron bars,",
        "17:17": "For whether he were husbandman, or shepherd, or a labourer in the field, he was overtaken, and endured that necessity, which could not be avoided: for they were all bound with one chain of darkness.",
        "17:18": "Whether it were a whistling wind, or a melodious noise of birds among the spreading branches, or a pleasing fall of water running violently,",
        "17:19": "Or a terrible sound of stones cast down, or a running that could not be seen of skipping beasts, or a roaring voice of most savage wild beasts, or a rebounding echo from the hollow mountains; these things made them to swoon for fear.",
        "17:20": "For the whole world shined with clear light, and none were hindered in their labour:",
        "17:21": "Over them only was spread an heavy night, an image of that darkness which should afterward receive them: but yet were they unto themselves more grievous than the darkness.",
        "18:1": "Nevertheless thy saints had a very great light, whose voice they hearing, and not seeing their shape, because they also had not suffered the same things, they counted them happy.",
        "18:2": "But for that they did not hurt them now, of whom they had been wronged before, they thanked them, and besought them pardon for that they had been enemies.",
        "18:3": "Instead whereof thou gavest them a burning pillar of fire, both to be a guide of the unknown journey, and an harmless sun to entertain them honourably.",
        "18:4": "For they were worthy to be deprived of light and imprisoned in darkness, who had kept thy sons shut up, by whom the uncorrupt light of the law was to be given unto the world.",
        "18:5": "And when they had determined to slay the babes of the saints, one child being cast forth, and saved, to reprove them, thou tookest away the multitude of their children, and destroyedst them altogether in a mighty water.",
        "18:6": "Of that night were our fathers certified afore, that assuredly knowing unto what oaths they had given credence, they might afterwards be of good cheer.",
        "18:7": "So of thy people was accepted both the salvation of the righteous, and destruction of the enemies.",
        "18:8": "For wherewith thou didst punish our adversaries, by the same thou didst glorify us, whom thou hadst called.",
        "18:9": "For the righteous children of good men did sacrifice secretly, and with one consent made a holy law, that the saints should be like partakers of the same good and evil, the fathers now singing out the songs of praise.",
        "18:10": "But on the other side there sounded an ill according cry of the enemies, and a lamentable noise was carried abroad for children that were bewailed.",
        "18:11": "The master and the servant were punished after one manner; and like as the king, so suffered the common person.",
        "18:12": "So they all together had innumerable dead with one kind of death; neither were the living sufficient to bury them: for in one moment the noblest offspring of them was destroyed.",
        "18:13": "For whereas they would not believe any thing by reason of the enchantments; upon the destruction of the firstborn, they acknowledged this people to be the sons of God.",
        "18:14": "For while all things were in quiet silence, and that night was in the midst of her swift course,",
        "18:15": "Thine Almighty word leaped down from heaven out of thy royal throne, as a fierce man of war into the midst of a land of destruction,",
        "18:16": "And brought thine unfeigned commandment as a sharp sword, and standing up filled all things with death; and it touched the heaven, but it stood upon the earth.",
        "18:17": "Then suddenly visions of horrible dreams troubled them sore, and terrors came upon them unlooked for.",
        "18:18": "And one thrown here, and another there, half dead, shewed the cause of his death.",
        "18:19": "For the dreams that troubled them did foreshew this, lest they should perish, and not know why they were afflicted.",
        "18:20": "Yea, the tasting of death touched the righteous also, and there was a destruction of the multitude in the wilderness: but the wrath endured not long.",
        "18:21": "For then the blameless man made haste, and stood forth to defend them; and bringing the shield of his proper ministry, even prayer, and the propitiation of incense, set himself against the wrath, and so brought the calamity to an end, declaring that he was thy servant.",
        "18:22": "So he overcame the destroyer, not with strength of body, nor force of arms, but with a word subdued him that punished, alleging the oaths and covenants made with the fathers.",
        "18:23": "For when the dead were now fallen down by heaps one upon another, standing between, he stayed the wrath, and parted the way to the living.",
        "18:24": "For in the long garment was the whole world, and in the four rows of the stones was the glory of the fathers graven, and thy Majesty upon the daidem of his head.",
        "18:25": "Unto these the destroyer gave place, and was afraid of them: for it was enough that they only tasted of the wrath.",
        "19:1": "As for the ungodly, wrath came upon them without mercy unto the end: for he knew before what they would do;",
        "19:2": "How that having given them leave to depart, and sent them hastily away, they would repent and pursue them.",
        "19:3": "For whilst they were yet mourning and making lamentation at the graves of the dead, they added another foolish device, and pursued them as fugitives, whom they had intreated to be gone.",
        "19:4": "For the destiny, whereof they were worthy, drew them unto this end, and made them forget the things that had already happened, that they might fulfil the punishment which was wanting to their torments:",
        "19:5": "And that thy people might pass a wonderful way: but they might find a strange death.",
        "19:6": "For the whole creature in his proper kind was fashioned again anew, serving the peculiar commandments that were given unto them, that thy children might be kept without hurt:",
        "19:7": "As namely, a cloud shadowing the camp; and where water stood before, dry land appeared; and out of the Red sea a way without impediment; and out of the violent stream a green field:",
        "19:8": "Wherethrough all the people went that were defended with thy hand, seeing thy marvellous strange wonders.",
        "19:9": "For they went at large like horses, and leaped like lambs, praising thee, O Lord, who hadst delivered them.",
        "19:10": "For they were yet mindful of the things that were done while they sojourned in the strange land, how the ground brought forth flies instead of cattle, and how the river cast up a multitude of frogs instead of fishes.",
        "19:11": "But afterwards they saw a new generation of fowls, when, being led with their appetite, they asked delicate meats.",
        "19:12": "For quails came up unto them from the sea for their contentment.",
        "19:13": "And punishments came upon the sinners not without former signs by the force of thunders: for they suffered justly according to their own wickedness, insomuch as they used a more hard and hateful behaviour toward strangers.",
        "19:14": "For the Sodomites did not receive those, whom they knew not when they came: but these brought friends into bondage, that had well deserved of them.",
        "19:15": "And not only so, but peradventure some respect shall be had of those, because they used strangers not friendly:",
        "19:16": "But these very grievously afflicted them, whom they had received with feastings, and were already made partakers of the same laws with them.",
        "19:17": "Therefore even with blindness were these stricken, as those were at the doors of the righteous man: when, being compassed about with horrible great darkness, every one sought the passage of his own doors.",
        "19:18": "For the elements were changed in themselves by a kind of harmony, like as in a psaltery notes change the name of the tune, and yet are always sounds; which may well be perceived by the sight of the things that have been done.",
        "19:19": "For earthly things were turned into watery, and the things, that before swam in the water, now went upon the ground.",
        "19:20": "The fire had power in the water, forgetting his own virtue: and the water forgat his own quenching nature.",
        "19:21": "On the other side, the flames wasted not the flesh of the corruptible living things, though they walked therein; neither melted they the icy kind of heavenly meat that was of nature apt to melt.",
        "19:22": "For in all things, O Lord, thou didst magnify thy people, and glorify them, neither didst thou lightly regard them: but didst assist them in every time and place."

        "1:3": "I Tobit have walked all the days of my life in the ways of truth and justice, and I did many almsdeeds to my brethren, and my nation, who came with me to Nineve, into the land of the Assyrians.",
        "1:4": "And when I was in mine own country, in the land of Israel being but young, all the tribe of Nephthali my father fell from the house of Jerusalem, which was chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, that all the tribes should sacrifice there, where the temple of the habitation of the most High was consecrated and built for all ages.",
        "1:5": "Now all the tribes which together revolted, and the house of my father Nephthali, sacrificed unto the heifer Baal.",
        "1:6": "But I alone went often to Jerusalem at the feasts, as it was ordained unto all the people of Israel by an everlasting decree, having the firstfruits and tenths of increase, with that which was first shorn; and them gave I at the altar to the priests the children of Aaron.",

        "2:10": "And I knew not that there were sparrows in the wall, and mine eyes being open, the sparrows muted warm dung into mine eyes, and a whiteness came in mine eyes: and I went to the physicians, but they helped me not: moreover Achiacharus did nourish me, until I went into Elymais.",
        "2:11": "And my wife Anna did take women’s works to do.",
        "2:12": "And when she had sent them home to the owners, they paid her wages, and gave her also besides a kid.",
        "2:13": "And when it was in my house, and began to cry, I said unto her, From whence is this kid? is it not stolen? render it to the owners; for it is not lawful to eat any thing that is stolen.",
        "2:14": "But she replied upon me, It was given for a gift more than the wages. Howbeit I did not believe her, but bade her render it to the owners: and I was abashed at her. But she replied upon me, Where are thine alms and thy righteous deeds? behold, thou and all thy works are known.",

        "3:5": "And now thy judgments are many and true: deal with me according to my sins and my fathers’: because we have not kept thy commandments, neither have walked in truth before thee.",
        "3:6": "Now therefore deal with me as seemeth best unto thee, and command my spirit to be taken from me, that I may be dissolved, and become earth: for it is profitable for me to die rather than to live, because I have heard false reproaches, and have much sorrow: command therefore that I may now be delivered out of this distress, and go into the everlasting place: turn not thy face away from me.",
        "3:7": "It came to pass the same day, that in Ecbatane a city of Media Sara the daughter of Raguel was also reproached by her father’s maids;",
        "3:8": "Because that she had been married to seven husbands, whom Asmodeus the evil spirit had killed, before they had lain with her. Dost thou not know, said they, that thou hast strangled thine husbands? thou hast had already seven husbands, neither wast thou named after any of them.",
        "3:9": "Wherefore dost thou beat us for them? if they be dead, go thy ways after them, let us never see of thee either son or daughter.",
        "3:10": "Whe she heard these things, she was very sorrowful, so that she thought to have strangled herself; and she said, I am the only daughter of my father, and if I do this, it shall be a reproach unto him, and I shall bring his old age with sorrow unto the grave.",
        "3:11": "Then she prayed toward the window, and said, Blessed art thou, O Lord my God, and thine holy and glorious name is blessed and honourable for ever: let all thy works praise thee for ever.",
        "3:12": "And now, O Lord, I set mine eyes and my face toward thee,",
        "3:13": "And say, Take me out of the earth, that I may hear no more the reproach.",
        "3:14": "Thou knowest, Lord, that I am pure from all sin with man,",
        "3:15": "And that I never polluted my name, nor the name of my father, in the land of my captivity: I am the only daughter of my father, neither hath he any child to be his heir, neither any near kinsman, nor any son of his alive, to whom I may keep myself for a wife: my seven husbands are already dead; and why should I live? but if it please not thee that I should die, command some regard to be had of me, and pity taken of me, that I hear no more reproach.",
        "3:16": "So the prayers of them both were heard before the majesty of the great God.",
        "3:17": "And Raphael was sent to heal them both, that is, to scale away the whiteness of Tobit’s eyes, and to give Sara the daughter of Raguel for a wife to Tobias the son of Tobit; and to bind Asmodeus the evil spirit; because she belonged to Tobias by right of inheritance. The selfsame time came Tobit home, and entered into his house, and Sara the daughter of Raguel came down from her upper chamber.",
        "4:1": "In that day Tobit remembered the money which he had committed to Gabael in Rages of Media,",
        "4:2": "And said with himself, I have wished for death; wherefore do I not call for my son Tobias that I may signify to him of the money before I die?",
        "4:3": "And when he had called him, he said, My son, when I am dead, bury me; and despise not thy mother, but honour her all the days of thy life, and do that which shall please her, and grieve her not.",
        "4:4": "Remember, my son, that she saw many dangers for thee, when thou wast in her womb: and when she is dead, bury her by me in one grave.",
        "4:5": "My son, be mindful of the Lord our God all thy days, and let not thy will be set to sin, or to transgress his commandments: do uprightly all thy life long, and follow not the ways of unrighteousness.",
        "4:6": "For if thou deal truly, thy doings shall prosperously succeed to thee, and to all them that live justly.",
        "4:7": "Give alms of thy substance; and when thou givest alms, let not thine eye be envious, neither turn thy face from any poor, and the face of God shall not be turned away from thee.",
        "4:8": "If thou hast abundance give alms accordingly: if thou have but a little, be not afraid to give according to that little:",
        "4:9": "For thou layest up a good treasure for thyself against the day of necessity.",
        "4:10": "Because that alms do deliver from death, and suffereth not to come into darkness.",
        "4:11": "For alms is a good gift unto all that give it in the sight of the most High.",
        "4:12": "Beware of all whoredom, my son, and chiefly take a wife of the seed of thy fathers, and take not a strange woman to wife, which is not of thy father’s tribe: for we are the children of the prophets, Noe, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: remember, my son, that our fathers from the beginning, even that they all married wives of their own kindred, and were blessed in their children, and their seed shall inherit the land.",
        "4:13": "Now therefore, my son, love thy brethren, and despise not in thy heart thy brethren, the sons and daughters of thy people, in not taking a wife of them: for in pride is destruction and much trouble, and in lewdness is decay and great want: for lewdness is the mother of famine.",
        "4:14": "Let not the wages of any man, which hath wrought for thee, tarry with thee, but give him it out of hand: for if thou serve God, he will also repay thee: be circumspect my son, in all things thou doest, and be wise in all thy conversation.",
        "4:15": "Do that to no man which thou hatest: drink not wine to make thee drunken: neither let drunkenness go with thee in thy journey.",
        "4:16": "Give of thy bread to the hungry, and of thy garments to them that are naked; and according to thine abundance give alms: and let not thine eye be envious, when thou givest alms.",
        "4:17": "Pour out thy bread on the burial of the just, but give nothing to the wicked.",
        "4:18": "Ask counsel of all that are wise, and despise not any counsel that is profitable.",
        "4:19": "Bless the Lord thy God alway, and desire of him that thy ways may be directed, and that all thy paths and counsels may prosper: for every nation hath not counsel; but the Lord himself giveth all good things, and he humbleth whom he will, as he will; now therefore, my son, remember my commandments, neither let them be put out of thy mind.",
        "4:20": "And now I signify this to they that I committed ten talents to Gabael the son of Gabrias at Rages in Media.",
        "4:21": "And fear not, my son, that we are made poor: for thou hast much wealth, if thou fear God, and depart from all sin, and do that which is pleasing in his sight.",
        "5:1": "Tobias then answered and said, Father, I will do all things which thou hast commanded me:",
        "5:2": "But how can I receive the money, seeing I know him not?",
        "5:3": "Then he gave him the handwriting, and said unto him, Seek thee a man which may go with thee, whiles I yet live, and I will give him wages: and go and receive the money.",
        "5:4": "Therefore when he went to seek a man, he found Raphael that was an angel.",
        "5:5": "But he knew not; and he said unto him, Canst thou go with me to Rages? and knowest thou those places well?",
        "5:6": "To whom the angel said, I will go with thee, and I know the way well: for I have lodged with our brother Gabael.",
        "5:7": "Then Tobias said unto him, Tarry for me, till I tell my father.",
        "5:8": "Then he said unto him, Go and tarry not. So he went in and said to his father, Behold, I have found one which will go with me. Then he said, Call him unto me, that I may know of what tribe he is, and whether he be a trusty man to go with thee.",
        "5:9": "So he called him, and he came in, and they saluted one another.",
        "5:10": "Then Tobit said unto him, Brother, shew me of what tribe and family thou art.",
        "5:11": "To whom he said, Dost thou seek for a tribe or family, or an hired man to go with thy son? Then Tobit said unto him, I would know, brother, thy kindred and name.",
        "5:12": "Then he said, I am Azarias, the son of Ananias the great, and of thy brethren.",
        "5:13": "Then Tobit said, Thou art welcome, brother; be not now angry with me, because I have enquired to know thy tribe and thy family; for thou art my brother, of an honest and good stock: for I know Ananias and Jonathas, sons of that great Samaias, as we went together to Jerusalem to worship, and offered the firstborn, and the tenths of the fruits; and they were not seduced with the error of our brethren: my brother, thou art of a good stock.",
        "5:14": "But tell me, what wages shall I give thee? wilt thou a drachm a day, and things necessary, as to mine own son?",
        "5:15": "Yea, moreover, if ye return safe, I will add something to thy wages.",
        "5:16": "So they were well pleased. Then said he to Tobias, Prepare thyself for the journey, and God send you a good journey. And when his son had prepared all things for the journey, his father said, Go thou with this man, and God, which dwelleth in heaven, prosper your journey, and the angel of God keep you company. So they went forth both, and the young man’s dog with them.",
        "5:17": "But Anna his mother wept, and said to Tobit, Why hast thou sent away our son? is he not the staff of our hand, in going in and out before us?",
        "5:18": "Be not greedy to add money to money: but let it be as refuse in respect of our child.",
        "5:19": "For that which the Lord hath given us to live with doth suffice us.",
        "5:20": "Then said Tobit to her, Take no care, my sister; he shall return in safety, and thine eyes shall see him.",
        "5:21": "For the good angel will keep him company, and his journey shall be prosperous, and he shall return safe.",
        "5:22": "Then she made an end of weeping.",
        "6:1": "And as they went on their journey, they came in the evening to the river Tigris, and they lodged there.",
        "6:2": "And when the young man went down to wash himself, a fish leaped out of the river, and would have devoured him.",
        "6:3": "Then the angel said unto him, Take the fish. And the young man laid hold of the fish, and drew it to land.",
        "6:4": "To whom the angel said, Open the fish, and take the heart and the liver and the gall, and put them up safely.",
        "6:5": "So the young man did as the angel commanded him; and when they had roasted the fish, they did eat it: then they both went on their way, till they drew near to Ecbatane.",
        "6:6": "Then the young man said to the angel, Brother Azarias, to what use is the heart and the liver and the gal of the fish?",
        "6:7": "And he said unto him, Touching the heart and the liver, if a devil or an evil spirit trouble any, we must make a smoke thereof before the man or the woman, and the party shall be no more vexed.",
        "6:8": "As for the gall, it is good to anoint a man that hath whiteness in his eyes, and he shall be healed.",
        "6:9": "And when they were come near to Rages,",
        "6:10": "The angel said to the young man, Brother, to day we shall lodge with Raguel, who is thy cousin; he also hath one only daughter, named Sara; I will speak for her, that she may be given thee for a wife.",
        "6:11": "For to thee doth the right of her appertain, seeing thou only art of her kindred.",
        "6:12": "And the maid is fair and wise: now therefore hear me, and I will speak to her father; and when we return from Rages we will celebrate the marriage: for I know that Raguel cannot marry her to another according to the law of Moses, but he shall be guilty of death, because the right of inheritance doth rather appertain to thee than to any other.",
        "6:13": "Then the young man answered the angel, I have heard, brother Azarias that this maid hath been given to seven men, who all died in the marriage chamber.",
        "6:14": "And now I am the only son of my father, and I am afraid, lest if I go in unto her, I die, as the other before: for a wicked spirit loveth her, which hurteth no body, but those which come unto her; wherefore I also fear lest I die, and bring my father’s and my mother’s life because of me to the grave with sorrow: for they have no other son to bury them.",
        "6:15": "Then the angel said unto him, Dost thou not remember the precepts which thy father gave thee, that thou shouldest marry a wife of thine own kindred? wherefore hear me, O my brother; for she shall be given thee to wife; and make thou no reckoning of the evil spirit; for this same night shall she be given thee in marriage.",
        "6:16": "And when thou shalt come into the marriage chamber, thou shalt take the ashes of perfume, and shalt lay upon them some of the heart and liver of the fish, and shalt make a smoke with it:",
        "6:17": "And the devil shall smell it, and flee away, and never come again any more: but when thou shalt come to her, rise up both of you, and pray to God which is merciful, who will have pity on you, and save you: fear not, for she is appointed unto thee from the beginning; and thou shalt preserve her, and she shall go with thee. Moreover I suppose that she shall bear thee children. Now when Tobias had heard these things, he loved her, and his heart was effectually joined to her.",
        "7:1": "And when they were come to Ecbatane, they came to the house of Raguel, and Sara met them: and after they had saluted one another, she brought them into the house.",
        "7:2": "Then said Raguel to Edna his wife, How like is this young man to Tobit my cousin!",
        "7:3": "And Raguel asked them, From whence are ye, brethren? To whom they said, We are of the sons of Nephthalim, which are captives in Nineve.",
        "7:4": "Then he said to them, Do ye know Tobit our kinsman? And they said, We know him. Then said he, Is he in good health?",
        "7:5": "And they said, He is both alive, and in good health: and Tobias said, He is my father.",
        "7:6": "Then Raguel leaped up, and kissed him, and wept,",
        "7:7": "And blessed him, and said unto him, Thou art the son of an honest and good man. But when he had heard that Tobit was blind, he was sorrowful, and wept.",
        "7:8": "And likewise Edna his wife and Sara his daughter wept. Moreover they entertained them cheerfully; and after that they had killed a ram of the flock, they set store of meat on the table. Then said Tobias to Raphael, Brother Azarias, speak of those things of which thou didst talk in the way, and let this business be dispatched.",
        "7:9": "So he communicated the matter with Raguel: and Raguel said to Tobias, Eat and drink, and make merry:",
        "7:10": "For it is meet that thou shouldest marry my daughter: nevertheless I will declare unto thee the truth.",
        "7:11": "I have given my daughter in marriage to seven men, who died that night they came in unto her: nevertheless for the present be merry. But Tobias said, I will eat nothing here, till we agree and swear one to another.",
        "7:12": "Raguel said, Then take her from henceforth according to the manner, for thou art her cousin, and she is thine, and the merciful God give you good success in all things.",
        "7:13": "Then he called his daughter Sara, and she came to her father, and he took her by the hand, and gave her to be wife to Tobias, saying, Behold, take her after the law of Moses, and lead her away to thy father. And he blessed them;",
        "7:14": "And called Edna his wife, and took paper, and did write an instrument of covenants, and sealed it.",
        "7:15": "Then they began to eat.",
        "7:16": "After Raguel called his wife Edna, and said unto her, Sister, prepare another chamber, and bring her in thither.",
        "7:17": "Which when she had done as he had bidden her, she brought her thither: and she wept, and she received the tears of her daughter, and said unto her,",
        "7:18": "Be of good comfort, my daughter; the Lord of heaven and earth give thee joy for this thy sorrow: be of good comfort, my daughter.",
        "8:1": "And when they had supped, they brought Tobias in unto her.",
        "8:2": "And as he went, he remembered the words of Raphael, and took the ashes of the perfumes, and put the heart and the liver of the fish thereupon, and made a smoke therewith.",
        "8:3": "The which smell when the evil spirit had smelled, he fled into the utmost parts of Egypt, and the angel bound him.",
        "8:4": "And after that they were both shut in together, Tobias rose out of the bed, and said, Sister, arise, and let us pray that God would have pity on us.",
        "8:5": "Then began Tobias to say, Blessed art thou, O God of our fathers, and blessed is thy holy and glorious name for ever; let the heavens bless thee, and all thy creatures.",
        "8:6": "Thou madest Adam, and gavest him Eve his wife for an helper and stay: of them came mankind: thou hast said, It is not good that man should be alone; let us make unto him an aid like unto himself.",
        "8:7": "And now, O Lord, I take not this my sister for lust but uprightly: therefore mercifully ordain that we may become aged together.",
        "8:8": "And she said with him, Amen.",
        "8:9": "So they slept both that night. And Raguel arose, and went and made a grave,",
        "8:10": "Saying, I fear lest he also be dead.",
        "8:11": "But when Raguel was come into his house,",
        "8:12": "He said unto his wife Edna. Send one of the maids, and let her see whether he be alive: if he be not, that we may bury him, and no man know it.",
        "8:13": "So the maid opened the door, and went in, and found them both asleep,",
        "8:14": "And came forth, and told them that he was alive.",
        "8:15": "Then Raguel praised God, and said, O God, thou art worthy to be praised with all pure and holy praise; therefore let thy saints praise thee with all thy creatures; and let all thine angels and thine elect praise thee for ever.",
        "8:16": "Thou art to be praised, for thou hast made me joyful; and that is not come to me which I suspected; but thou hast dealt with us according to thy great mercy.",
        "8:17": "Thou art to be praised because thou hast had mercy of two that were the only begotten children of their fathers: grant them mercy, O Lord, and finish their life in health with joy and mercy.",
        "8:18": "Then Raguel bade his servants to fill the grave.",
        "8:19": "And he kept the wedding feast fourteen days.",
        "8:20": "For before the days of the marriage were finished, Raguel had said unto him by an oath, that he should not depart till the fourteen days of the marriage were expired;",
        "8:21": "And then he should take the half of his goods, and go in safety to his father; and should have the rest when I and my wife be dead.",
        "9:1": "Then Tobias called Raphael, and said unto him,",
        "9:2": "Brother Azarias, take with thee a servant, and two camels, and go to Rages of Media to Gabael, and bring me the money, and bring him to the wedding.",
        "9:3": "For Raguel hath sworn that I shall not depart.",
        "9:4": "But my father counteth the days; and if I tarry long, he will be very sorry.",
        "9:5": "So Raphael went out, and lodged with Gabael, and gave him the handwriting: who brought forth bags which were sealed up, and gave them to him.",
        "9:6": "And early in the morning they went forth both together, and came to the wedding: and Tobias blessed his wife.",
        "10:1": "Now Tobit his father counted every day: and when the days of the journey were expired, and they came not,",
        "10:2": "Then Tobit said, Are they detained? or is Gabael dead, and there is no man to give him the money?",
        "10:3": "Therefore he was very sorry.",
        "10:4": "Then his wife said unto him, My son is dead, seeing he stayeth long; and she began to wail him, and said,",
        "10:5": "Now I care for nothing, my son, since I have let thee go, the light of mine eyes.",
        "10:6": "To whom Tobit said, Hold thy peace, take no care, for he is safe.",
        "10:7": "But she said, Hold thy peace, and deceive me not; my son is dead. And she went out every day into the way which they went, and did eat no meat on the daytime, and ceased not whole nights to bewail her son Tobias, until the fourteen days of the wedding were expired, which Raguel had sworn that he should spend there. Then Tobias said to Raguel, Let me go, for my father and my mother look no more to see me.",
        "10:8": "But his father in law said unto him, Tarry with me, and I will send to thy father, and they shall declare unto him how things go with thee.",
        "10:9": "But Tobias said, No; but let me go to my father.",
        "10:10": "Then Raguel arose, and gave him Sara his wife, and half his goods, servants, and cattle, and money:",
        "10:11": "And he blessed them, and sent them away, saying, The God of heaven give you a prosperous journey, my children.",
        "10:12": "And he said to his daughter, Honour thy father and thy mother in law, which are now thy parents, that I may hear good report of thee. And he kissed her. Edna also said to Tobias, The Lord of heaven restore thee, my dear brother, and grant that I may see thy children of my daughter Sara before I die, that I may rejoice before the Lord: behold, I commit my daughter unto thee of special trust; where are do not entreat her evil.",
        "11:1": "After these things Tobias went his way, praising God that he had given him a prosperous journey, and blessed Raguel and Edna his wife, and went on his way till they drew near unto Nineve.",
        "11:2": "Then Raphael said to Tobias, Thou knowest, brother, how thou didst leave thy father:",
        "11:3": "Let us haste before thy wife, and prepare the house.",
        "11:4": "And take in thine hand the gall of the fish. So they went their way, and the dog went after them.",
        "11:5": "Now Anna sat looking about toward the way for her son.",
        "11:6": "And when she espied him coming, she said to his father, Behold, thy son cometh, and the man that went with him.",
        "11:7": "Then said Raphael, I know, Tobias, that thy father will open his eyes.",
        "11:8": "Therefore anoint thou his eyes with the gall, and being pricked therewith, he shall rub, and the whiteness shall fall away, and he shall see thee.",
        "11:9": "Then Anna ran forth, and fell upon the neck of her son, and said unto him, Seeing I have seen thee, my son, from henceforth I am content to die. And they wept both.",
        "11:10": "Tobit also went forth toward the door, and stumbled: but his son ran unto him,",
        "11:11": "And took hold of his father: and he strake of the gall on his fathers’ eyes, saying, Be of good hope, my father.",
        "11:12": "And when his eyes began to smart, he rubbed them;",
        "11:13": "And the whiteness pilled away from the corners of his eyes: and when he saw his son, he fell upon his neck.",
        "11:14": "And he wept, and said, Blessed art thou, O God, and blessed is thy name for ever; and blessed are all thine holy angels:",
        "11:15": "For thou hast scourged, and hast taken pity on me: for, behold, I see my son Tobias. And his son went in rejoicing, and told his father the great things that had happened to him in Media.",
        "11:16": "Then Tobit went out to meet his daughter in law at the gate of Nineve, rejoicing and praising God: and they which saw him go marvelled, because he had received his sight.",
        "11:17": "But Tobias gave thanks before them, because God had mercy on him. And when he came near to Sara his daughter in law, he blessed her, saying, Thou art welcome, daughter: God be blessed, which hath brought thee unto us, and blessed be thy father and thy mother. And there was joy among all his brethren which were at Nineve.",
        "11:18": "And Achiacharus, and Nasbas his brother’s son, came:",
        "11:19": "And Tobias’ wedding was kept seven days with great joy.",
        "12:1": "Then Tobit called his son Tobias, and said unto him, My son, see that the man have his wages, which went with thee, and thou must give him more.",
        "12:2": "And Tobias said unto him, O father, it is no harm to me to give him half of those things which I have brought:",
        "12:3": "For he hath brought me again to thee in safety, and made whole my wife, and brought me the money, and likewise healed thee.",
        "12:4": "Then the old man said, It is due unto him.",
        "12:5": "So he called the angel, and he said unto him, Take half of all that ye have brought and go away in safety.",
        "12:6": "Then he took them both apart, and said unto them, Bless God, praise him, and magnify him, and praise him for the things which he hath done unto you in the sight of all that live. It is good to praise God, and exalt his name, and honourably to shew forth the works of God; therefore be not slack to praise him.",
        "12:7": "It is good to keep close the secret of a king, but it is honourable to reveal the works of God. Do that which is good, and no evil shall touch you.",
        "12:8": "Prayer is good with fasting and alms and righteousness. A little with righteousness is better than much with unrighteousness. It is better to give alms than to lay up gold:",
        "12:9": "For alms doth deliver from death, and shall purge away all sin. Those that exercise alms and righteousness shall be filled with life:",
        "12:10": "But they that sin are enemies to their own life.",
        "12:11": "Surely I will keep close nothing from you. For I said, It was good to keep close the secret of a king, but that it was honourable to reveal the works of God.",
        "12:12": "Now therefore, when thou didst pray, and Sara thy daughter in law, I did bring the remembrance of your prayers before the Holy One: and when thou didst bury the dead, I was with thee likewise.",
        "12:13": "And when thou didst not delay to rise up, and leave thy dinner, to go and cover the dead, thy good deed was not hid from me: but I was with thee.",
        "12:14": "And now God hath sent me to heal thee and Sara thy daughter in law.",
        "12:15": "I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels, which present the prayers of the saints, and which go in and out before the glory of the Holy One.",
        "12:16": "Then they were both troubled, and fell upon their faces: for they feared.",
        "12:17": "But he said unto them, Fear not, for it shall go well with you; praise God therefore.",
        "12:18": "For not of any favour of mine, but by the will of our God I came; wherefore praise him for ever.",
        "12:19": "All these days I did appear unto you; but I did neither eat nor drink, but ye did see a vision.",
        "12:20": "Now therefore give God thanks: for I go up to him that sent me; but write all things which are done in a book.",
        "12:21": "And when they arose, they saw him no more.",
        "12:22": "Then they confessed the great and wonderful works of God, and how the angel of the Lord had appeared unto them.",
        "13:1": "Then Tobit wrote a prayer of rejoicing, and said, Blessed be God that liveth for ever, and blessed be his kingdom.",
        "13:2": "For he doth scourge, and hath mercy: he leadeth down to hell, and bringeth up again: neither is there any that can avoid his hand.",
        "13:3": "Confess him before the Gentiles, ye children of Israel: for he hath scattered us among them.",
        "13:4": "There declare his greatness, and extol him before all the living: for he is our Lord, and he is the God our Father for ever.",
        "13:5": "And he will scourge us for our iniquities, and will have mercy again, and will gather us out of all nations, among whom he hath scattered us.",
        "13:6": "If ye turn to him with your whole heart, and with your whole mind, and deal uprightly before him, then will he turn unto you, and will not hide his face from you. Therefore see what he will do with you, and confess him with your whole mouth, and praise the Lord of might, and extol the everlasting King. In the land of my captivity do I praise him, and declare his might and majesty to a sinful nation. O ye sinners, turn and do justice before him: who can tell if he will accept you, and have mercy on you?",
        "13:7": "I will extol my God, and my soul shall praise the King of heaven, and shall rejoice in his greatness.",
        "13:8": "Let all men speak, and let all praise him for his righteousness.",
        "13:9": "O Jerusalem, the holy city, he will scourge thee for thy children’s works, and will have mercy again on the sons of the righteous.",
        "13:10": "Give praise to the Lord, for he is good: and praise the everlasting King, that his tabernacle may be builded in thee again with joy, and let him make joyful there in thee those that are captives, and love in thee for ever those that are miserable.",
        "13:11": "Many nations shall come from far to the name of the Lord God with gifts in their hands, even gifts to the King of heaven; all generations shall praise thee with great joy.",
        "13:12": "Cursed are all they which hate thee, and blessed shall all be which love thee for ever.",
        "13:13": "Rejoice and be glad for the children of the just: for they shall be gathered together, and shall bless the Lord of the just.",
        "13:14": "O blessed are they which love thee, for they shall rejoice in thy peace: blessed are they which have been sorrowful for all thy scourges; for they shall rejoice for thee, when they have seen all thy glory, and shall be glad for ever.",
        "13:15": "Let my soul bless God the great King.",
        "13:16": "For Jerusalem shall be built up with sapphires and emeralds, and precious stone: thy walls and towers and battlements with pure gold.",
        "13:17": "And the streets of Jerusalem shall be paved with beryl and carbuncle and stones of Ophir.",
        "13:18": "And all her streets shall say, Alleluia; and they shall praise him, saying, Blessed be God, which hath extolled it for ever.",
        "14:1": "So Tobit made an end of praising God.",
        "14:2": "And he was eight and fifty years old when he lost his sight, which was restored to him after eight years: and he gave alms, and he increased in the fear of the Lord God, and praised him.",
        "14:3": "And when he was very aged he called his son, and the sons of his son, and said to him, My son, take thy children; for, behold, I am aged, and am ready to depart out of this life.",
        "14:4": "Go into Media my son, for I surely believe those things which Jonas the prophet spake of Nineve, that it shall be overthrown; and that for a time peace shall rather be in Media; and that our brethren shall lie scattered in the earth from that good land: and Jerusalem shall be desolate, and the house of God in it shall be burned, and shall be desolate for a time;",
        "14:5": "And that again God will have mercy on them, and bring them again into the land, where they shall build a temple, but not like to the first, until the time of that age be fulfilled; and afterward they shall return from all places of their captivity, and build up Jerusalem gloriously, and the house of God shall be built in it for ever with a glorious building, as the prophets have spoken thereof.",
        "14:6": "And all nations shall turn, and fear the Lord God truly, and shall bury their idols.",
        "14:7": "So shall all nations praise the Lord, and his people shall confess God, and the Lord shall exalt his people; and all those which love the Lord God in truth and justice shall rejoice, shewing mercy to our brethren.",
        "14:8": "And now, my son, depart out of Nineve, because that those things which the prophet Jonas spake shall surely come to pass.",
        "14:9": "But keep thou the law and the commandments, and shew thyself merciful and just, that it may go well with thee.",
        "14:10": "And bury me decently, and thy mother with me; but tarry no longer at Nineve. Remember, my son, how Aman handled Achiacharus that brought him up, how out of light he brought him into darkness, and how he rewarded him again: yet Achiacharus was saved, but the other had his reward: for he went down into darkness. Manasses gave alms, and escaped the snares of death which they had set for him: but Aman fell into the snare, and perished.",
        "14:11": "Wherefore now, my son, consider what alms doeth, and how righteousness doth deliver. When he had said these things, he gave up the ghost in the bed, being an hundred and eight and fifty years old; and he buried him honourably.",

        "5:3": "And he said unto them, Tell me now, ye sons of Chanaan, who this people is, that dwelleth in the hill country, and what are the cities that they inhabit, and what is the multitude of their army, and wherein is their power and strength, and what king is set over them, or captain of their army;",
        "5:4": "And why have they determined not to come and meet me, more than all the inhabitants of the west.",
        "5:5": "Then said Achior, the captain of all the sons of Ammon, Let my lord now hear a word from the mouth of thy servant, and I will declare unto thee the truth concerning this people, which dwelleth near thee, and inhabiteth the hill countries: and there shall no lie come out of the mouth of thy servant.",

        "5:7": "And they sojourned heretofore in Mesopotamia, because they would not follow the gods of their fathers, which were in the land of Chaldea.",

        "5:9": "Then their God commanded them to depart from the place where they sojourned, and to go into the land of Chanaan: where they dwelt, and were increased with gold and silver, and with very much cattle.",
        "5:10": "But when a famine covered all the land of Chanaan, they went down into Egypt, and sojourned there, while they were nourished, and became there a great multitude, so that one could not number their nation.",
        "5:11": "Therefore the king of Egypt rose up against them, and dealt subtilly with them, and brought them low with labouring in brick, and made them slaves.",
        "5:12": "Then they cried unto their God, and he smote all the land of Egypt with incurable plagues: so the Egyptians cast them out of their sight.",
        "5:13": "And God dried the Red sea before them,",
        "5:14": "And brought them to mount Sina, and Cades-Barne, and cast forth all that dwelt in the wilderness.",
        "5:15": "So they dwelt in the land of the Amorites, and they destroyed by their strength all them of Esebon, and passing over Jordan they possessed all the hill country.",
        "5:16": "And they cast forth before them the Chanaanite, the Pherezite, the Jebusite, and the Sychemite, and all the Gergesites, and they dwelt in that country many days.",
        "5:17": "And whilst they sinned not before their God, they prospered, because the God that hateth iniquity was with them.",
        "5:18": "But when they departed from the way which he appointed them, they were destroyed in many battles very sore, and were led captives into a land that was not their’s, and the temple of their God was cast to the ground, and their cities were taken by the enemies.",
        "5:19": "But now are they returned to their God, and are come up from the places where they were scattered, and have possessed Jerusalem, where their sanctuary is, and are seated in the hill country; for it was desolate.",
        "5:20": "Now therefore, my lord and governor, if there be any error against this people, and they sin against their God, let us consider that this shall be their ruin, and let us go up, and we shall overcome them.",
        "5:21": "But if there be no iniquity in their nation, let my lord now pass by, lest their Lord defend them, and their God be for them, and we become a reproach before all the world.",
        "5:22": "And when Achior had finished these sayings, all the people standing round about the tent murmured, and the chief men of Holofernes, and all that dwelt by the sea side, and in Moab, spake that he should kill him.",
        "5:23": "For, say they, we will not be afraid of the face of the children of Israel: for, lo, it is a people that have no strength nor power for a strong battle",
        "5:24": "Now therefore, lord Holofernes, we will go up, and they shall be a prey to be devoured of all thine army.",
        "6:1": "And when the tumult of men that were about the council was ceased, Holofernes the chief captain of the army of Assur said unto Achior and all the Moabites before all the company of other nations,",
        "6:2": "And who art thou, Achior, and the hirelings of Ephraim, that thou hast prophesied against us as to day, and hast said, that we should not make war with the people of Israel, because their God will defend them? and who is God but Nabuchodonosor?",
        "6:3": "He will send his power, and will destroy them from the face of the earth, and their God shall not deliver them: but we his servants will destroy them as one man; for they are not able to sustain the power of our horses.",
        "6:4": "For with them we will tread them under foot, and their mountains shall be drunken with their blood, and their fields shall be filled with their dead bodies, and their footsteps shall not be able to stand before us, for they shall utterly perish, saith king Nabuchodonosor, lord of all the earth: for he said, None of my words shall be in vain.",
        "6:5": "And thou, Achior, an hireling of Ammon, which hast spoken these words in the day of thine iniquity, shalt see my face no more from this day, until I take vengeance of this nation that came out of Egypt.",
        "6:6": "And then shall the sword of mine army, and the multitude of them that serve me, pass through thy sides, and thou shalt fall among their slain, when I return.",
        "6:7": "Now therefore my servants shall bring thee back into the hill country, and shall set thee in one of the cities of the passages:",
        "6:8": "And thou shalt not perish, till thou be destroyed with them.",
        "6:9": "And if thou persuade thyself in thy mind that they shall be taken, let not thy countenance fall: I have spoken it, and none of my words shall be in vain.",
        "6:10": "Then Holofernes commanded his servants, that waited in his tent, to take Achior, and bring him to Bethulia, and deliver him into the hands of the children of Israel.",
        "6:11": "So his servants took him, and brought him out of the camp into the plain, and they went from the midst of the plain into the hill country, and came unto the fountains that were under Bethulia.",
        "6:12": "And when the men of the city saw them, they took up their weapons, and went out of the city to the top of the hill: and every man that used a sling kept them from coming up by casting of stones against them.",
        "6:13": "Nevertheless having gotten privily under the hill, they bound Achior, and cast him down, and left him at the foot of the hill, and returned to their lord.",
        "6:14": "But the Israelites descended from their city, and came unto him, and loosed him, and brought him to Bethulia, and presented him to the governors of the city:",
        "6:15": "Which were in those days Ozias the son of Micha, of the tribe of Simeon, and Chabris the son of Gothoniel, and Charmis the son of Melchiel.",
        "6:16": "And they called together all the ancients of the city, and all their youth ran together, and their women, to the assembly, and they set Achior in the midst of all their people. Then Ozias asked him of that which was done.",
        "6:17": "And he answered and declared unto them the words of the council of Holofernes, and all the words that he had spoken in the midst of the princes of Assur, and whatsoever Holofernes had spoken proudly against the house of Israel.",
        "6:18": "Then the people fell down and worshipped God, and cried unto God. saying,",
        "6:19": "O Lord God of heaven, behold their pride, and pity the low estate of our nation, and look upon the face of those that are sanctified unto thee this day.",
        "6:20": "Then they comforted Achior, and praised him greatly.",
        "6:21": "And Ozias took him out of the assembly unto his house, and made a feast to the elders; and they called on the God of Israel all that night for help.",
        "7:1": "The next day Holofernes commanded all his army, and all his people which were come to take his part, that they should remove their camp against Bethulia, to take aforehand the ascents of the hill country, and to make war against the children of Israel.",
        "7:2": "Then their strong men removed their camps in that day, and the army of the men of war was an hundred and seventy thousand footmen, and twelve thousand horsemen, beside the baggage, and other men that were afoot among them, a very great multitude.",
        "7:3": "And they camped in the valley near unto Bethulia, by the fountain, and they spread themselves in breadth over Dothaim even to Belmaim, and in length from Bethulia unto Cynamon, which is over against Esdraelon.",
        "7:4": "Now the children of Israel, when they saw the multitude of them, were greatly troubled, and said every one to his neighbour, Now will these men lick up the face of the earth; for neither the high mountains, nor the valleys, nor the hills, are able to bear their weight.",
        "7:5": "Then every man took up his weapons of war, and when they had kindled fires upon their towers, they remained and watched all that night.",
        "7:6": "But in the second day Holofernes brought forth all his horsemen in the sight of the children of Israel which were in Bethulia,",
        "7:7": "And viewed the passages up to the city, and came to the fountains of their waters, and took them, and set garrisons of men of war over them, and he himself removed toward his people.",
        "7:8": "Then came unto him all the chief of the children of Esau, and all the governors of the people of Moab, and the captains of the sea coast, and said,",
        "7:9": "Let our lord now hear a word, that there be not an overthrow in thine army.",
        "7:10": "For this people of the children of Israel do not trust in their spears, but in the height of the mountains wherein they dwell, because it is not easy to come up to the tops of their mountains.",
        "7:11": "Now therefore, my lord, fight not against them in battle array, and there shall not so much as one man of thy people perish.",
        "7:12": "Remain in thy camp, and keep all the men of thine army, and let thy servants get into their hands the fountain of water, which issueth forth of the foot of the mountain:",
        "7:13": "For all the inhabitants of Bethulia have their water thence; so shall thirst kill them, and they shall give up their city, and we and our people shall go up to the tops of the mountains that are near, and will camp upon them, to watch that none go out of the city.",
        "7:14": "So they and their wives and their children shall be consumed with fire, and before the sword come against them, they shall be overthrown in the streets where they dwell.",
        "7:15": "Thus shalt thou render them an evil reward; because they rebelled, and met not thy person peaceably.",
        "7:16": "And these words pleased Holofernes and all his servants, and he appointed to do as they had spoken.",
        "7:17": "So the camp of the children of Ammon departed, and with them five thousand of the Assyrians, and they pitched in the valley, and took the waters, and the fountains of the waters of the children of Israel.",
        "7:18": "Then the children of Esau went up with the children of Ammon, and camped in the hill country over against Dothaim: and they sent some of them toward the south, and toward the east over against Ekrebel, which is near unto Chusi, that is upon the brook Mochmur; and the rest of the army of the Assyrians camped in the plain, and covered the face of the whole land; and their tents and carriages were pitched to a very great multitude.",
        "7:19": "Then the children of Israel cried unto the Lord their God, because their heart failed, for all their enemies had compassed them round about, and there was no way to escape out from among them.",
        "7:20": "Thus all the company of Assur remained about them, both their footmen, chariots, and horsemen, four and thirty days, so that all their vessels of water failed all the inhibitants of Bethulia.",
        "7:21": "And the cisterns were emptied, and they had not water to drink their fill for one day; for they gave them drink by measure.",
        "7:22": "Therefore their young children were out of heart, and their women and young men fainted for thirst, and fell down in the streets of the city, and by the passages of the gates, and there was no longer any strength in them.",
        "7:23": "Then all the people assembled to Ozias, and to the chief of the city, both young men, and women, and children, and cried with a loud voice, and said before all the elders,",
        "7:24": "God be judge between us and you: for ye have done us great injury, in that ye have not required peace of the children of Assur.",
        "7:25": "For now we have no helper: but God hath sold us into their hands, that we should be thrown down before them with thirst and great destruction.",
        "7:26": "Now therefore call them unto you, and deliver the whole city for a spoil to the people of Holofernes, and to all his army.",
        "7:27": "For it is better for us to be made a spoil unto them, than to die for thirst: for we will be his servants, that our souls may live, and not see the death of our infants before our eyes, nor our wives nor our children to die.",
        "7:28": "We take to witness against you the heaven and the earth, and our God and Lord of our fathers, which punisheth us according to our sins and the sins of our fathers, that he do not according as we have said this day.",
        "7:29": "Then there was great weeping with one consent in the midst of the assembly; and they cried unto the Lord God with a loud voice.",
        "7:30": "Then said Ozias to them, Brethren, be of good courage, let us yet endure five days, in the which space the Lord our God may turn his mercy toward us; for he will not forsake us utterly.",
        "7:31": "And if these days pass, and there come no help unto us, I will do according to your word.",
        "7:32": "And he dispersed the people, every one to their own charge; and they went unto the walls and towers of their city, and sent the women and children into their houses: and they were very low brought in the city.",
        "8:1": "Now at that time Judith heard thereof, which was the daughter of Merari, the son of Ox, the son of Joseph, the son of Ozel, the son of Elcia, the son of Ananias, the son of Gedeon, the son of Raphaim, the son of Acitho, the son of Eliu, the son of Eliab, the son of Nathanael, the son of Samael, the son of Salasadal, the son of Israel.",
        "8:2": "And Manasses was her husband, of her tribe and kindred, who died in the barley harvest.",
        "8:3": "For as he stood overseeing them that bound sheaves in the field, the heat came upon his head, and he fell on his bed, and died in the city of Bethulia: and they buried him with his fathers in the field between Dothaim and Balamo.",
        "8:4": "So Judith was a widow in her house three years and four months.",
        "8:5": "And she made her a tent upon the top of her house, and put on sackcloth upon her loins and ware her widow’s apparel.",
        "8:6": "And she fasted all the days of her widowhood, save the eves of the sabbaths, and the sabbaths, and the eves of the new moons, and the new moons and the feasts and solemn days of the house of Israel.",
        "8:7": "She was also of a goodly countenance, and very beautiful to behold: and her husband Manasses had left her gold, and silver, and menservants and maidservants, and cattle, and lands; and she remained upon them.",
        "8:8": "And there was none that gave her an ill word; as she feared God greatly.",
        "8:9": "Now when she heard the evil words of the people against the governor, that they fainted for lack of water; for Judith had heard all the words that Ozias had spoken unto them, and that he had sworn to deliver the city unto the Assyrians after five days;",
        "8:10": "Then she sent her waitingwoman, that had the government of all things that she had, to call Ozias and Chabris and Charmis, the ancients of the city.",
        "8:11": "And they came unto her, and she said unto them, Hear me now, O ye governors of the inhabitants of Bethulia: for your words that ye have spoken before the people this day are not right, touching this oath which ye made and pronounced between God and you, and have promised to deliver the city to our enemies, unless within these days the Lord turn to help you.",
        "8:12": "And now who are ye that have tempted God this day, and stand instead of God among the children of men?",
        "8:13": "And now try the Lord Almighty, but ye shall never know any thing.",
        "8:14": "For ye cannot find the depth of the heart of man, neither can ye perceive the things that he thinketh: then how can ye search out God, that hath made all these things, and know his mind, or comprehend his purpose? Nay, my brethren, provoke not the Lord our God to anger.",
        "8:15": "For if he will not help us within these five days, he hath power to defend us when he will, even every day, or to destroy us before our enemies.",
        "8:16": "Do not bind the counsels of the Lord our God: for God is not as man, that he may be threatened; neither is he as the son of man, that he should be wavering.",
        "8:17": "Therefore let us wait for salvation of him, and call upon him to help us, and he will hear our voice, if it please him.",
        "8:18": "For there arose none in our age, neither is there any now in these days neither tribe, nor family, nor people, nor city among us, which worship gods made with hands, as hath been aforetime.",
        "8:19": "For the which cause our fathers were given to the sword, and for a spoil, and had a great fall before our enemies.",
        "8:20": "But we know none other god, therefore we trust that he will not despise us, nor any of our nation.",
        "8:21": "For if we be taken so, all Judea shall lie waste, and our sanctuary shall be spoiled; and he will require the profanation thereof at our mouth.",
        "8:22": "And the slaughter of our brethren, and the captivity of the country, and the desolation of our inheritance, will he turn upon our heads among the Gentiles, wheresoever we shall be in bondage; and we shall be an offence and a reproach to all them that possess us.",
        "8:23": "For our servitude shall not be directed to favour: but the Lord our God shall turn it to dishonour.",
        "8:24": "Now therefore, O brethren, let us shew an example to our brethren, because their hearts depend upon us, and the sanctuary, and the house, and the altar, rest upon us.",
        "8:25": "Moreover let us give thanks to the Lord our God, which trieth us, even as he did our fathers.",
        "8:26": "Remember what things he did to Abraham, and how he tried Isaac, and what happened to Jacob in Mesopotamia of Syria, when he kept the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother.",
        "8:27": "For he hath not tried us in the fire, as he did them, for the examination of their hearts, neither hath he taken vengeance on us: but the Lord doth scourge them that come near unto him, to admonish them.",
        "8:28": "Then said Ozias to her, All that thou hast spoken hast thou spoken with a good heart, and there is none that may gainsay thy words.",
        "8:29": "For this is not the first day wherein thy wisdom is manifested; but from the beginning of thy days all the people have known thy understanding, because the disposition of thine heart is good.",
        "8:30": "But the people were very thirsty, and compelled us to do unto them as we have spoken, and to bring an oath upon ourselves, which we will not break.",
        "8:31": "Therefore now pray thou for us, because thou art a godly woman, and the Lord will send us rain to fill our cisterns, and we shall faint no more.",
        "8:32": "Then said Judith unto them, Hear me, and I will do a thing, which shall go throughout all generations to the children of our nation.",
        "8:33": "Ye shall stand this night in the gate, and I will go forth with my waitingwoman: and within the days that ye have promised to deliver the city to our enemies the Lord will visit Israel by mine hand.",
        "8:34": "But enquire not ye of mine act: for I will not declare it unto you, till the things be finished that I do.",
        "8:35": "Then said Ozias and the princes unto her, Go in peace, and the Lord God be before thee, to take vengeance on our enemies.",
        "8:36": "So they returned from the tent, and went to their wards.",
        "9:1": "Judith fell upon her face, and put ashes upon her head, and uncovered the sackcloth wherewith she was clothed; and about the time that the incense of that evening was offered in Jerusalem in the house of the Lord Judith cried with a loud voice, and said,",
        "9:2": "O Lord God of my father Simeon, to whom thou gavest a sword to take vengeance of the strangers, who loosened the girdle of a maid to defile her, and discovered the thigh to her shame, and polluted her virginity to her reproach; for thou saidst, It shall not be so; and yet they did so:",
        "9:3": "Wherefore thou gavest their rulers to be slain, so that they dyed their bed in blood, being deceived, and smotest the servants with their lords, and the lords upon their thrones;",
        "9:4": "And hast given their wives for a prey, and their daughters to be captives, and all their spoils to be divided among thy dear children; which were moved with thy zeal, and abhorred the pollution of their blood, and called upon thee for aid: O God, O my God, hear me also a widow.",
        "9:5": "For thou hast wrought not only those things, but also the things which fell out before, and which ensued after; thou hast thought upon the things which are now, and which are to come.",
        "9:6": "Yea, what things thou didst determine were ready at hand, and said, Lo, we are here: for all thy ways are prepared, and thy judgments are in thy foreknowledge.",
        "9:7": "For, behold, the Assyrians are multiplied in their power; they are exalted with horse and man; they glory in the strength of their footmen; they trust in shield, and spear, and bow, and sling; and know not that thou art the Lord that breakest the battles: the Lord is thy name.",
        "9:8": "Throw down their strength in thy power, and bring down their force in thy wrath: for they have purposed to defile thy sanctuary, and to pollute the tabernacle where thy glorious name resteth and to cast down with sword the horn of thy altar.",
        "9:9": "Behold their pride, and send thy wrath upon their heads: give into mine hand, which am a widow, the power that I have conceived.",
        "9:10": "Smite by the deceit of my lips the servant with the prince, and the prince with the servant: break down their stateliness by the hand of a woman.",
        "9:11": "For thy power standeth not in multitude nor thy might in strong men: for thou art a God of the afflicted, an helper of the oppressed, an upholder of the weak, a protector of the forlorn, a saviour of them that are without hope.",
        "9:12": "I pray thee, I pray thee, O God of my father, and God of the inheritance of Israel, Lord of the heavens and earth, Creator of the waters, king of every creature, hear thou my prayer:",
        "9:13": "And make my speech and deceit to be their wound and stripe, who have purposed cruel things against thy covenant, and thy hallowed house, and against the top of Sion, and against the house of the possession of thy children.",
        "9:14": "And make every nation and tribe to acknowledge that thou art the God of all power and might, and that there is none other that protecteth the people of Israel but thou.",
        "10:1": "Now after that she had ceased to cry unto the God of Israel, and bad made an end of all these words.",
        "10:2": "She rose where she had fallen down, and called her maid, and went down into the house in the which she abode in the sabbath days, and in her feast days,",
        "10:3": "And pulled off the sackcloth which she had on, and put off the garments of her widowhood, and washed her body all over with water, and anointed herself with precious ointment, and braided the hair of her head, and put on a tire upon it, and put on her garments of gladness, wherewith she was clad during the life of Manasses her husband.",
        "10:4": "And she took sandals upon her feet, and put about her her bracelets, and her chains, and her rings, and her earrings, and all her ornaments, and decked herself bravely, to allure the eyes of all men that should see her.",
        "10:5": "Then she gave her maid a bottle of wine, and a cruse of oil, and filled a bag with parched corn, and lumps of figs, and with fine bread; so she folded all these things together, and laid them upon her.",
        "10:6": "Thus they went forth to the gate of the city of Bethulia, and found standing there Ozias and the ancients of the city, Chabris and Charmis.",
        "10:7": "And when they saw her, that her countenance was altered, and her apparel was changed, they wondered at her beauty very greatly, and said unto her.",
        "10:8": "The God, the God of our fathers give thee favour, and accomplish thine enterprizes to the glory of the children of Israel, and to the exaltation of Jerusalem. Then they worshipped God.",
        "10:9": "And she said unto them, Command the gates of the city to be opened unto me, that I may go forth to accomplish the things whereof ye have spoken with me. So they commanded the young men to open unto her, as she had spoken.",
        "10:10": "And when they had done so, Judith went out, she, and her maid with her; and the men of the city looked after her, until she was gone down the mountain, and till she had passed the valley, and could see her no more.",
        "10:11": "Thus they went straight forth in the valley: and the first watch of the Assyrians met her,",
        "10:12": "And took her, and asked her, Of what people art thou? and whence comest thou? and whither goest thou? And she said, I am a woman of the Hebrews, and am fled from them: for they shall be given you to be consumed:",
        "10:13": "And I am coming before Holofernes the chief captain of your army, to declare words of truth; and I will shew him a way, whereby he shall go, and win all the hill country, without losing the body or life of any one of his men.",
        "10:14": "Now when the men heard her words, and beheld her countenance, they wondered greatly at her beauty, and said unto her,",
        "10:15": "Thou hast saved thy life, in that thou hast hasted to come down to the presence of our lord: now therefore come to his tent, and some of us shall conduct thee, until they have delivered thee to his hands.",
        "10:16": "And when thou standest before him, be not afraid in thine heart, but shew unto him according to thy word; and he will entreat thee well.",
        "10:17": "Then they chose out of them an hundred men to accompany her and her maid; and they brought her to the tent of Holofernes.",
        "10:18": "Then was there a concourse throughout all the camp: for her coming was noised among the tents, and they came about her, as she stood without the tent of Holofernes, till they told him of her.",
        "10:19": "And they wondered at her beauty, and admired the children of Israel because of her, and every one said to his neighbour, Who would despise this people, that have among them such women? surely it is not good that one man of them be left who being let go might deceive the whole earth.",
        "10:20": "And they that lay near Holofernes went out, and all his servants and they brought her into the tent.",
        "10:21": "Now Holofernes rested upon his bed under a canopy, which was woven with purple, and gold, and emeralds, and precious stones.",
        "10:22": "So they shewed him of her; and he came out before his tent with silver lamps going before him.",
        "10:23": "And when Judith was come before him and his servants they all marvelled at the beauty of her countenance; and she fell down upon her face, and did reverence unto him: and his servants took her up.",
        "11:1": "Then said Holofernes unto her, Woman, be of good comfort, fear not in thine heart: for I never hurt any that was willing to serve Nabuchodonosor, the king of all the earth.",
        "11:2": "Now therefore, if thy people that dwelleth in the mountains had not set light by me, I would not have lifted up my spear against them: but they have done these things to themselves.",
        "11:3": "But now tell me wherefore thou art fled from them, and art come unto us: for thou art come for safeguard; be of good comfort, thou shalt live this night, and hereafter:",
        "11:4": "For none shall hurt thee, but entreat thee well, as they do the servants of king Nabuchodonosor my lord.",
        "11:5": "Then Judith said unto him, Receive the words of thy servant, and suffer thine handmaid to speak in thy presence, and I will declare no lie to my lord this night.",
        "11:6": "And if thou wilt follow the words of thine handmaid, God will bring the thing perfectly to pass by thee; and my lord shall not fail of his purposes.",
        "11:7": "As Nabuchodonosor king of all the earth liveth, and as his power liveth, who hath sent thee for the upholding of every living thing: for not only men shall serve him by thee, but also the beasts of the field, and the cattle, and the fowls of the air, shall live by thy power under Nabuchodonosor and all his house.",
        "11:8": "For we have heard of thy wisdom and thy policies, and it is reported in all the earth, that thou only art excellent in all the kingdom, and mighty in knowledge, and wonderful in feats of war.",
        "11:9": "Now as concerning the matter, which Achior did speak in thy council, we have heard his words; for the men of Bethulia saved him, and he declared unto them all that he had spoken unto thee.",
        "11:10": "Therefore, O lord and governor, respect not his word; but lay it up in thine heart, for it is true: for our nation shall not be punished, neither can sword prevail against them, except they sin against their God.",
        "11:11": "And now, that my lord be not defeated and frustrate of his purpose, even death is now fallen upon them, and their sin hath overtaken them, wherewith they will provoke their God to anger whensoever they shall do that which is not fit to be done:",
        "11:12": "For their victuals fail them, and all their water is scant, and they have determined to lay hands upon their cattle, and purposed to consume all those things, that God hath forbidden them to eat by his laws:",
        "11:13": "And are resolved to spend the firstfruits of the the tenths of wine and oil, which they had sanctified, and reserved for the priests that serve in Jerusalem before the face of our God; the which things it is not lawful for any of the people so much as to touch with their hands.",
        "11:14": "For they have sent some to Jerusalem, because they also that dwell there have done the like, to bring them a licence from the senate.",
        "11:15": "Now when they shall bring them word, they will forthwith do it, and they shall be given to thee to be destroyed the same day.",
        "11:16": "Wherefore I thine handmaid, knowing all this, am fled from their presence; and God hath sent me to work things with thee, whereat all the earth shall be astonished, and whosoever shall hear it.",
        "11:17": "For thy servant is religious, and serveth the God of heaven day and night: now therefore, my lord, I will remain with thee, and thy servant will go out by night into the valley, and I will pray unto God, and he will tell me when they have committed their sins:",
        "11:18": "And I will come and shew it unto thee: then thou shalt go forth with all thine army, and there shall be none of them that shall resist thee.",
        "11:19": "And I will lead thee through the midst of Judea, until thou come before Jerusalem; and I will set thy throne in the midst thereof; and thou shalt drive them as sheep that have no shepherd, and a dog shall not so much as open his mouth at thee: for these things were told me according to my foreknowledge, and they were declared unto me, and I am sent to tell thee.",
        "11:20": "Then her words pleased Holofernes and all his servants; and they marvelled at her wisdom, and said,",
        "11:21": "There is not such a woman from one end of the earth to the other, both for beauty of face, and wisdom of words.",
        "11:22": "Likewise Holofernes said unto her. God hath done well to send thee before the people, that strength might be in our hands and destruction upon them that lightly regard my lord.",
        "11:23": "And now thou art both beautiful in thy countenance, and witty in thy words: surely if thou do as thou hast spoken thy God shall be my God, and thou shalt dwell in the house of king Nabuchodonosor, and shalt be renowned through the whole earth.",
        "12:1": "Then he commanded to bring her in where his plate was set; and bade that they should prepare for her of his own meats, and that she should drink of his own wine.",
        "12:2": "And Judith said, I will not eat thereof, lest there be an offence: but provision shall be made for me of the things that I have brought.",
        "12:3": "Then Holofernes said unto her, If thy provision should fail, how should we give thee the like? for there be none with us of thy nation.",
        "12:4": "Then said Judith unto him As thy soul liveth, my lord, thine handmaid shall not spend those things that I have, before the Lord work by mine hand the things that he hath determined.",
        "12:5": "Then the servants of Holofernes brought her into the tent, and she slept till midnight, and she arose when it was toward the morning watch,",
        "12:6": "And sent to Holofernes, saving, Let my lord now command that thine handmaid may go forth unto prayer.",
        "12:7": "Then Holofernes commanded his guard that they should not stay her: thus she abode in the camp three days, and went out in the night into the valley of Bethulia, and washed herself in a fountain of water by the camp.",
        "12:8": "And when she came out, she besought the Lord God of Israel to direct her way to the raising up of the children of her people.",
        "12:9": "So she came in clean, and remained in the tent, until she did eat her meat at evening.",
        "12:10": "And in the fourth day Holofernes made a feast to his own servants only, and called none of the officers to the banquet.",
        "12:11": "Then said he to Bagoas the eunuch, who had charge over all that he had, Go now, and persuade this Hebrew woman which is with thee, that she come unto us, and eat and drink with us.",
        "12:12": "For, lo, it will be a shame for our person, if we shall let such a woman go, not having had her company; for if we draw her not unto us, she will laugh us to scorn.",
        "12:13": "Then went Bagoas from the presence of Holofernes, and came to her, and he said, Let not this fair damsel fear to come to my lord, and to be honoured in his presence, and drink wine, and be merry with us and be made this day as one of the daughters of the Assyrians, which serve in the house of Nabuchodonosor.",
        "12:14": "Then said Judith unto him, Who am I now, that I should gainsay my lord? surely whatsoever pleaseth him I will do speedily, and it shall be my joy unto the day of my death.",
        "12:15": "So she arose, and decked herself with her apparel and all her woman’s attire, and her maid went and laid soft skins on the ground for her over against Holofernes, which she had received of Bagoas far her daily use, that she might sit and eat upon them.",
        "12:16": "Now when Judith came in and sat down, Holofernes his heart was ravished with her, and his mind was moved, and he desired greatly her company; for he waited a time to deceive her, from the day that he had seen her.",
        "12:17": "Then said Holofernes unto her, Drink now, and be merry with us.",
        "12:18": "So Judith said, I will drink now, my lord, because my life is magnified in me this day more than all the days since I was born.",
        "12:19": "Then she took and ate and drank before him what her maid had prepared.",
        "12:20": "And Holofernes took great delight in her, and drank more wine than he had drunk at any time in one day since he was born.",
        "13:1": "Now when the evening was come, his servants made haste to depart, and Bagoas shut his tent without, and dismissed the waiters from the presence of his lord; and they went to their beds: for they were all weary, because the feast had been long.",
        "13:2": "And Judith was left along in the tent, and Holofernes lying along upon his bed: for he was filled with wine.",
        "13:3": "Now Judith had commanded her maid to stand without her bedchamber, and to wait for her. coming forth, as she did daily: for she said she would go forth to her prayers, and she spake to Bagoas according to the same purpose.",
        "13:4": "So all went forth and none was left in the bedchamber, neither little nor great. Then Judith, standing by his bed, said in her heart, O Lord God of all power, look at this present upon the works of mine hands for the exaltation of Jerusalem.",
        "13:5": "For now is the time to help thine inheritance, and to execute thine enterprizes to the destruction of the enemies which are risen against us.",
        "13:6": "Then she came to the pillar of the bed, which was at Holofernes’ head, and took down his fauchion from thence,",
        "13:7": "And approached to his bed, and took hold of the hair of his head, and said, Strengthen me, O Lord God of Israel, this day.",
        "13:8": "And she smote twice upon his neck with all her might, and she took away his head from him.",
        "13:9": "And tumbled his body down from the bed, and pulled down the canopy from the pillars; and anon after she went forth, and gave Holofernes his head to her maid;",
        "13:10": "And she put it in her bag of meat: so they twain went together according to their custom unto prayer: and when they passed the camp, they compassed the valley, and went up the mountain of Bethulia, and came to the gates thereof.",
        "13:11": "Then said Judith afar off, to the watchmen at the gate, Open, open now the gate: God, even our God, is with us, to shew his power yet in Jerusalem, and his forces against the enemy, as he hath even done this day.",
        "13:12": "Now when the men of her city heard her voice, they made haste to go down to the gate of their city, and they called the elders of the city.",
        "13:13": "And then they ran all together, both small and great, for it was strange unto them that she was come: so they opened the gate, and received them, and made a fire for a light, and stood round about them.",
        "13:14": "Then she said to them with a loud voice, Praise, praise God, praise God, I say, for he hath not taken away his mercy from the house of Israel, but hath destroyed our enemies by mine hands this night.",
        "13:15": "So she took the head out of the bag, and shewed it, and said unto them, behold the head of Holofernes, the chief captain of the army of Assur, and behold the canopy, wherein he did lie in his drunkenness; and the Lord hath smitten him by the hand of a woman.",
        "13:16": "As the Lord liveth, who hath kept me in my way that I went, my countenance hath deceived him to his destruction, and yet hath he not committed sin with me, to defile and shame me.",
        "13:17": "Then all the people were wonderfully astonished, and bowed themselves and worshipped God, and said with one accord, Blessed be thou, O our God, which hast this day brought to nought the enemies of thy people.",
        "13:18": "Then said Ozias unto her, O daughter, blessed art thou of the most high God above all the women upon the earth; and blessed be the Lord God, which hath created the heavens and the earth, which hath directed thee to the cutting off of the head of the chief of our enemies.",
        "13:19": "For this thy confidence shall not depart from the heart of men, which remember the power of God for ever.",
        "13:20": "And God turn these things to thee for a perpetual praise, to visit thee in good things because thou hast not spared thy life for the affliction of our nation, but hast revenged our ruin, walking a straight way before our God. And all the people said; So be it, so be it.",
        "14:1": "Then said Judith unto them, Hear me now, my brethren, and take this head, and hang it upon the highest place of your walls.",
        "14:2": "And so soon as the morning shall appear, and the sun shall come forth upon the earth, take ye every one his weapons, and go forth every valiant man out of the city, and set ye a captain over them, as though ye would go down into the field toward the watch of the Assyrians; but go not down.",
        "14:3": "Then they shall take their armour, and shall go into their camp, and raise up the captains of the army of Assur, and shall run to the tent of Holofernes, but shall not find him: then fear shall fall upon them, and they shall flee before your face.",
        "14:4": "So ye, and all that inhabit the coast of Israel, shall pursue them, and overthrow them as they go.",

        "16:5": "He bragged that he would burn up my borders, and kill my young men with the sword, and dash the sucking children against the ground, and make mine infants as a prey, and my virgins as a spoil.",
        "16:6": "But the Almighty Lord hath disappointed them by the hand of a woman.",
        "16:7": "For the mighty one did not fall by the young men, neither did the sons of the Titans smite him, nor high giants set upon him: but Judith the daughter of Merari weakened him with the beauty of her countenance.",
        "16:8": "For she put off the garment of her widowhood for the exaltation of those that were oppressed in Israel, and anointed her face with ointment, and bound her hair in a tire, and took a linen garment to deceive him.",
        "16:9": "Her sandals ravished his eyes, her beauty took his mind prisoner, and the fauchion passed through his neck.",
        "16:10": "The Persians quaked at her boldness, and the Medes were daunted at her hardiness.",

        "16:12": "The sons of the damsels have pierced them through, and wounded them as fugatives’ children: they perished by the battle of the Lord.",
        "16:13": "I will sing unto the Lord a new song: O Lord, thou art great and glorious, wonderful in strength, and invincible.",

        "16:16": "For all sacrifice is too little for a sweet savour unto thee, and all the fat is not sufficient for thy burnt offering: but he that feareth the Lord is great at all times.",
        "16:17": "Woe to the nations that rise up against my kindred! the Lord Almighty will take vengeance of them in the day of judgment, in putting fire and worms in their flesh; and they shall feel them, and weep for ever.",

        "16:23": "But she increased more and more in honour, and waxed old in her husband’s house, being an hundred and five years old, and made her maid free; so she died in Bethulia: and they buried her in the cave of her husband Manasses.",
        "16:24": "And the house of Israel lamented her seven days: and before she died, she did distribute her goods to all them that were nearest of kindred to Manasses her husband, and to them that were the nearest of her kindred.",
        "16:25": "And there was none that made the children of Israel any more afraid in the days of Judith, nor a long time after her death."

        "1:2": "And made many wars, and won many strong holds, and slew the kings of the earth,",

        "1:12": "So this device pleased them well.",
        "1:13": "Then certain of the people were so forward herein, that they went to the king, who gave them licence to do after the ordinances of the heathen:",
        "1:14": "Whereupon they built a place of exercise at Jerusalem according to the customs of the heathen:",

        "1:36": "For it was a place to lie in wait against the sanctuary, and an evil adversary to Israel.",
        "1:37": "Thus they shed innocent blood on every side of the sanctuary, and defiled it:",
        "1:38": "Insomuch that the inhabitants of Jerusalem fled because of them: whereupon the city was made an habitation of strangers, and became strange to those that were born in her; and her own children left her.",

        "1:58": "Thus did they by their authority unto the Israelites every month, to as many as were found in the cities.",
        "1:59": "Now the five and twentieth day of the month they did sacrifice upon the idol altar, which was upon the altar of God.",
        "1:60": "At which time according to the commandment they put to death certain women, that had caused their children to be circumcised.",
        "1:61": "And they hanged the infants about their necks, and rifled their houses, and slew them that had circumcised them.",
        "1:62": "Howbeit many in Israel were fully resolved and confirmed in themselves not to eat any unclean thing.",
        "1:63": "Wherefore the rather to die, that they might not be defiled with meats, and that they might not profane the holy covenant: so then they died.",
        "1:64": "And there was very great wrath upon Israel.",
        "2:1": "In those days arose Mattathias the son of John, the son of Simeon, a priest of the sons of Joarib, from Jerusalem, and dwelt in Modin.",

        "2:7": "He said, Woe is me! wherefore was I born to see this misery of my people, and of the holy city, and to dwell there, when it was delivered into the hand of the enemy, and the sanctuary into the hand of strangers?",
        "2:8": "Her temple is become as a man without glory.",
        "2:9": "Her glorious vessels are carried away into captivity, her infants are slain in the streets, her young men with the sword of the enemy.",
        "2:10": "What nation hath not had a part in her kingdom and gotten of her spoils?",
        "2:11": "All her ornaments are taken away; of a free woman she is become a bondslave.",
        "2:12": "And, behold, our sanctuary, even our beauty and our glory, is laid waste, and the Gentiles have profaned it.",
        "2:13": "To what end therefore shall we live any longer?",
        "2:14": "Then Mattathias and his sons rent their clothes, and put on sackcloth, and mourned very sore.",
        "2:15": "In the mean while the king’s officers, such as compelled the people to revolt, came into the city Modin, to make them sacrifice.",
        "2:16": "And when many of Israel came unto them, Mattathias also and his sons came together.",
        "2:17": "Then answered the king’s officers, and said to Mattathias on this wise, Thou art a ruler, and an honourable and great man in this city, and strengthened with sons and brethren:",
        "2:18": "Now therefore come thou first, and fulfil the king’s commandment, like as all the heathen have done, yea, and the men of Juda also, and such as remain at Jerusalem: so shalt thou and thy house be in the number of the king’s friends, and thou and thy children shall be honoured with silver and gold, and many rewards.",
        "2:19": "Then Mattathias answered and spake with a loud voice, Though all the nations that are under the king’s dominion obey him, and fall away every one from the religion of their fathers, and give consent to his commandments:",
        "2:20": "Yet will I and my sons and my brethren walk in the covenant of our fathers.",
        "2:21": "God forbid that we should forsake the law and the ordinances.",
        "2:22": "We will not hearken to the king’s words, to go from our religion, either on the right hand, or the left.",
        "2:23": "Now when he had left speaking these words, there came one of the Jews in the sight of all to sacrifice on the altar which was at Modin, according to the king’s commandment.",
        "2:24": "Which thing when Mattathias saw, he was inflamed with zeal, and his reins trembled, neither could he forbear to shew his anger according to judgment: wherefore he ran, and slew him upon the altar.",
        "2:25": "Also the king’s commissioner, who compelled men to sacrifice, he killed at that time, and the altar he pulled down.",
        "2:26": "Thus dealt he zealously for the law of God like as Phinees did unto Zambri the son of Salom.",
        "2:27": "And Mattathias cried throughout the city with a loud voice, saying, Whosoever is zealous of the law, and maintaineth the covenant, let him follow me.",
        "2:28": "So he and his sons fled into the mountains, and left all that ever they had in the city.",
        "2:29": "Then many that sought after justice and judgment went down into the wilderness, to dwell there:",
        "2:30": "Both they, and their children, and their wives; and their cattle; because afflictions increased sore upon them.",
        "2:31": "Now when it was told the king’s servants, and the host that was at Jerusalem, in the city of David, that certain men, who had broken the king’s commandment, were gone down into the secret places in the wilderness,",
        "2:32": "They pursued after them a great number, and having overtaken them, they camped against them, and made war against them on the sabbath day.",
        "2:33": "And they said unto them, Let that which ye have done hitherto suffice; come forth, and do according to the commandment of the king, and ye shall live.",
        "2:34": "But they said, We will not come forth, neither will we do the king’s commandment, to profane the sabbath day.",
        "2:35": "So then they gave them the battle with all speed.",
        "2:36": "Howbeit they answered them not, neither cast they a stone at them, nor stopped the places where they lay hid;",
        "2:37": "But said, Let us die all in our innocency: heaven and earth will testify for us, that ye put us to death wrongfully.",
        "2:38": "So they rose up against them in battle on the sabbath, and they slew them, with their wives and children and their cattle, to the number of a thousand people.",
        "2:39": "Now when Mattathias and his friends understood hereof, they mourned for them right sore.",
        "2:40": "And one of them said to another, If we all do as our brethren have done, and fight not for our lives and laws against the heathen, they will now quickly root us out of the earth.",
        "2:41": "At that time therefore they decreed, saying, Whosoever shall come to make battle with us on the sabbath day, we will fight against him; neither will we die all, as our brethren that were murdered im the secret places.",
        "2:42": "Then came there unto him a company of Assideans who were mighty men of Israel, even all such as were voluntarily devoted unto the law.",
        "2:43": "Also all they that fled for persecution joined themselves unto them, and were a stay unto them.",
        "2:44": "So they joined their forces, and smote sinful men in their anger, and wicked men in their wrath: but the rest fled to the heathen for succour.",
        "2:45": "Then Mattathias and his friends went round about, and pulled down the altars:",
        "2:46": "And what children soever they found within the coast of Israel uncircumcised, those they circumcised valiantly.",
        "2:47": "They pursued also after the proud men, and the work prospered in their hand.",
        "2:48": "So they recovered the law out of the hand of the Gentiles, and out of the hand of kings, neither suffered they the sinner to triumph.",
        "2:49": "Now when the time drew near that Mattathias should die, he said unto his sons, Now hath pride and rebuke gotten strength, and the time of destruction, and the wrath of indignation:",
        "2:50": "Now therefore, my sons, be ye zealous for the law, and give your lives for the covenant of your fathers.",
        "2:51": "Call to remembrance what acts our fathers did in their time; so shall ye receive great honour and an everlasting name.",
        "2:52": "Was not Abraham found faithful in temptation, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness?",
        "2:53": "Joseph in the time of his distress kept the commandment and was made lord of Egypt.",
        "2:54": "Phinees our father in being zealous and fervent obtained the covenant of an everlasting priesthood.",
        "2:55": "Jesus for fulfilling the word was made a judge in Israel.",
        "2:56": "Caleb for bearing witness before the congregation received the heritage of the land.",
        "2:57": "David for being merciful possessed the throne of an everlasting kingdom.",
        "2:58": "Elias for being zealous and fervent for the law was taken up into heaven.",
        "2:59": "Ananias, Azarias, and Misael, by believing were saved out of the flame.",
        "2:60": "Daniel for his innocency was delivered from the mouth of lions.",
        "2:61": "And thus consider ye throughout all ages, that none that put their trust in him shall be overcome.",
        "2:62": "Fear not then the words of a sinful man: for his glory shall be dung and worms.",
        "2:63": "To day he shall be lifted up and to morrow he shall not be found, because he is returned into his dust, and his thought is come to nothing.",
        "2:64": "Wherefore, ye my sons, be valiant and shew yourselves men in the behalf of the law; for by it shall ye obtain glory.",
        "2:65": "And behold, I know that your brother Simon is a man of counsel, give ear unto him alway: he shall be a father unto you.",
        "2:66": "As for Judas Maccabeus, he hath been mighty and strong, even from his youth up: let him be your captain, and fight the battle of the people.",
        "2:67": "Take also unto you all those that observe the law, and avenge ye the wrong of your people.",
        "2:68": "Recompense fully the heathen, and take heed to the commandments of the law.",
        "2:69": "So he blessed them, and was gathered to his fathers.",
        "2:70": "And he died in the hundred forty and sixth year, and his sons buried him in the sepulchres of his fathers at Modin, and all Israel made great lamentation for him.",
        "3:1": "Then his son Judas, called Maccabeus, rose up in his stead.",
        "3:2": "And all his brethren helped him, and so did all they that held with his father, and they fought with cheerfulness the battle of Israel.",
        "3:3": "So he gat his people great honour, and put on a breastplate as a giant, and girt his warlike harness about him, and he made battles, protecting the host with his sword.",
        "3:4": "In his acts he was like a lion, and like a lion’s whelp roaring for his prey.",
        "3:5": "For He pursued the wicked, and sought them out, and burnt up those that vexed his people.",
        "3:6": "Wherefore the wicked shrunk for fear of him, and all the workers of iniquity were troubled, because salvation prospered in his hand.",
        "3:7": "He grieved also many kings, and made Jacob glad with his acts, and his memorial is blessed for ever.",
        "3:8": "Moreover he went through the cities of Juda, destroying the ungodly out of them, and turning away wrath from Israel:",
        "3:9": "So that he was renowned unto the utmost part of the earth, and he received unto him such as were ready to perish.",
        "3:10": "Then Apollonius gathered the Gentiles together, and a great host out of Samaria, to fight against Israel.",

        "3:12": "Wherefore Judas took their spoils, and Apollonius’ sword also, and therewith he fought all his life long.",
        "3:13": "Now when Seron, a prince of the army of Syria, heard say that Judas had gathered unto him a multitude and company of the faithful to go out with him to war;",
        "3:14": "He said, I will get me a name and honour in the kingdom; for I will go fight with Judas and them that are with him, who despise the king’s commandment.",
        "3:15": "So he made him ready to go up, and there went with him a mighty host of the ungodly to help him, and to be avenged of the children of Israel.",
        "3:16": "And when he came near to the going up of Bethhoron, Judas went forth to meet him with a small company:",
        "3:17": "Who, when they saw the host coming to meet them, said unto Judas, How shall we be able, being so few, to fight against so great a multitude and so strong, seeing we are ready to faint with fasting all this day?",
        "3:18": "Unto whom Judas answered, It is no hard matter for many to be shut up in the hands of a few; and with the God of heaven it is all one, to deliver with a great multitude, or a small company:",
        "3:19": "For the victory of battle standeth not in the multitude of an host; but strength cometh from heaven.",
        "3:20": "They come against us in much pride and iniquity to destroy us, and our wives and children, and to spoil us:",
        "3:21": "But we fight for our lives and our laws.",

        "3:23": "Now as soon as he had left off speaking, he leapt suddenly upon them, and so Seron and his host was overthrown before him.",
        "3:24": "And they pursued them from the going down of Bethhoron unto the plain, where were slain about eight hundred men of them; and the residue fled into the land of the Philistines.",
        "3:25": "Then began the fear of Judas and his brethren, and an exceeding great dread, to fall upon the nations round about them:",
        "3:26": "Insomuch as his fame came unto the king, and all nations talked of the battles of Judas.",
        "3:27": "Now when king Antiochus heard these things, he was full of indignation: wherefore he sent and gathered together all the forces of his realm, even a very strong army.",
        "3:28": "He opened also his treasure, and gave his soldiers pay for a year, commanding them to be ready whensoever he should need them.",
        "3:29": "Nevertheless, when he saw that the money of his treasures failed and that the tributes in the country were small, because of the dissension and plague, which he had brought upon the land in taking away the laws which had been of old time;",
        "3:30": "He feared that he should not be able to bear the charges any longer, nor to have such gifts to give so liberally as he did before: for he had abounded above the kings that were before him.",
        "3:31": "Wherefore, being greatly perplexed in his mind, he determined to go into Persia, there to take the tributes of the countries, and to gather much money.",
        "3:32": "So he left Lysias, a nobleman, and one of the blood royal, to oversee the affairs of the king from the river Euphrates unto the borders of Egypt:",
        "3:33": "And to bring up his son Antiochus, until he came again.",
        "3:34": "Moreover he delivered unto him the half of his forces, and the elephants, and gave him charge of all things that he would have done, as also concerning them that dwelt in Juda and Jerusalem:",
        "3:35": "To wit, that he should send an army against them, to destroy and root out the strength of Israel, and the remnant of Jerusalem, and to take away their memorial from that place;",
        "3:36": "And that he should place strangers in all their quarters, and divide their land by lot.",
        "3:37": "So the king took the half of the forces that remained, and departed from Antioch, his royal city, the hundred forty and seventh year; and having passed the river Euphrates, he went through the high countries.",
        "3:38": "Then Lysias chose Ptolemee the son of Dorymenes, Nicanor, and Gorgias, mighty men of the king’s friends:",
        "3:39": "And with them he sent forty thousand footmen, and seven thousand horsemen, to go into the land of Juda, and to destroy it, as the king commanded.",
        "3:40": "So they went forth with all their power, and came and pitched by Emmaus in the plain country.",
        "3:41": "And the merchants of the country, hearing the fame of them, took silver and gold very much, with servants, and came into the camp to buy the children of Israel for slaves: a power also of Syria and of the land of the Philistines joined themselves unto them.",
        "3:42": "Now when Judas and his brethren saw that miseries were multiplied, and that the forces did encamp themselves in their borders: for they knew how the king had given commandment to destroy the people, and utterly abolish them;",
        "3:43": "They said one to another, Let us restore the decayed fortune of our people, and let us fight for our people and the sanctuary.",
        "3:44": "Then was the congregation gathered together, that they might be ready for battle, and that they might pray, and ask mercy and compassion.",
        "3:45": "Now Jerusalem lay void as a wilderness, there was none of her children that went in or out: the sanctuary also was trodden down, and aliens kept the strong hold; the heathen had their habitation in that place; and joy was taken from Jacob, and the pipe with the harp ceased.",
        "3:46": "Wherefore the Israelites assembled themselves together, and came to Maspha, over against Jerusalem; for in Maspha was the place where they prayed aforetime in Israel.",
        "3:47": "Then they fasted that day, and put on sackcloth, and cast ashes upon their heads, and rent their clothes,",
        "3:48": "And laid open the book of the law, wherein the heathen had sought to paint the likeness of their images.",
        "3:49": "They brought also the priests’ garments, and the firstfruits, and the tithes: and the Nazarites they stirred up, who had accomplished their days.",
        "3:50": "Then cried they with a loud voice toward heaven, saying, What shall we do with these, and whither shall we carry them away?",
        "3:51": "For thy sanctuary is trodden down and profaned, and thy priests are in heaviness, and brought low.",
        "3:52": "And lo, the heathen are assembled together against us to destroy us: what things they imagine against us, thou knowest.",
        "3:53": "How shall we be able to stand against them, except thou, O God, be our help?",
        "3:54": "Then sounded they with trumpets, and cried with a loud voice.",
        "3:55": "And after this Judas ordained captains over the people, even captains over thousands, and over hundreds, and over fifties, and over tens.",
        "3:56": "But as for such as were building houses, or had betrothed wives, or were planting vineyards, or were fearful, those he commanded that they should return, every man to his own house, according to the law.",
        "3:57": "So the camp removed, and pitched upon the south side of Emmaus.",
        "3:58": "And Judas said, arm yourselves, and be valiant men, and see that ye be in readiness against the morning, that ye may fight with these nations, that are assembled together against us to destroy us and our sanctuary:",
        "3:59": "For it is better for us to die in battle, than to behold the calamities of our people and our sanctuary.",
        "3:60": "Nevertheless, as the will of God is in heaven, so let him do.",
        "4:1": "Then took Gorgias five thousand footmen, and a thousand of the best horsemen, and removed out of the camp by night;",
        "4:2": "To the end he might rush in upon the camp of the Jews, and smite them suddenly. And the men of the fortress were his guides.",
        "4:3": "Now when Judas heard thereof he himself removed, and the valiant men with him, that he might smite the king’s army which was at Emmaus,",
        "4:4": "While as yet the forces were dispersed from the camp.",
        "4:5": "In the mean season came Gorgias by night into the camp of Judas: and when he found no man there, he sought them in the mountains: for said he, These fellows flee from us",
        "4:6": "But as soon as it was day, Judas shewed himself in the plain with three thousand men, who nevertheless had neither armour nor swords to their minds.",
        "4:7": "And they saw the camp of the heathen, that it was strong and well harnessed, and compassed round about with horsemen; and these were expert of war.",
        "4:8": "Then said Judas to the men that were with him, Fear ye not their multitude, neither be ye afraid of their assault.",
        "4:9": "Remember how our fathers were delivered in the Red sea, when Pharaoh pursued them with an army.",
        "4:10": "Now therefore let us cry unto heaven, if peradventure the Lord will have mercy upon us, and remember the covenant of our fathers, and destroy this host before our face this day:",
        "4:11": "That so all the heathen may know that there is one who delivereth and saveth Israel.",
        "4:12": "Then the strangers lifted up their eyes, and saw them coming over against them.",
        "4:13": "Wherefore they went out of the camp to battle; but they that were with Judas sounded their trumpets.",
        "4:14": "So they joined battle, and the heathen being discomfited fled into the plain.",
        "4:15": "Howbeit all the hindmost of them were slain with the sword: for they pursued them unto Gazera, and unto the plains of Idumea, and Azotus, and Jamnia, so that there were slain of them upon a three thousand men.",
        "4:16": "This done, Judas returned again with his host from pursuing them,",
        "4:17": "And said to the people, Be not greedy of the spoil inasmuch as there is a battle before us,",
        "4:18": "And Gorgias and his host are here by us in the mountain: but stand ye now against our enemies, and overcome them, and after this ye may boldly take the spoils.",
        "4:19": "As Judas was yet speaking these words, there appeared a part of them looking out of the mountain:",
        "4:20": "Who when they perceived that the Jews had put their host to flight and were burning the tents; for the smoke that was seen declared what was done:",
        "4:21": "When therefore they perceived these things, they were sore afraid, and seeing also the host of Judas in the plain ready to fight,",
        "4:22": "They fled every one into the land of strangers.",
        "4:23": "Then Judas returned to spoil the tents, where they got much gold, and silver, and blue silk, and purple of the sea, and great riches.",
        "4:24": "After this they went home, and sung a song of thanksgiving, and praised the Lord in heaven: because it is good, because his mercy endureth forever.",
        "4:25": "Thus Israel had a great deliverance that day.",
        "4:26": "Now all the strangers that had escaped came and told Lysias what had happened:",
        "4:27": "Who, when he heard thereof, was confounded and discouraged, because neither such things as he would were done unto Israel, nor such things as the king commanded him were come to pass.",
        "4:28": "The next year therefore following Lysias gathered together threescore thousand choice men of foot, and five thousand horsemen, that he might subdue them.",
        "4:29": "So they came into Idumea, and pitched their tents at Bethsura, and Judas met them with ten thousand men.",
        "4:30": "And when he saw that mighty army, he prayed and said, Blessed art thou, O Saviour of Israel, who didst quell the violence of the mighty man by the hand of thy servant David, and gavest the host of strangers into the hands of Jonathan the son of Saul, and his armourbearer;",
        "4:31": "Shut up this army in the hand of thy people Israel, and let them be confounded in their power and horsemen:",
        "4:32": "Make them to be of no courage, and cause the boldness of their strength to fall away, and let them quake at their destruction:",
        "4:33": "Cast them down with the sword of them that love thee, and let all those that know thy name praise thee with thanksgiving.",
        "4:34": "So they joined battle; and there were slain of the host of Lysias about five thousand men, even before them were they slain.",
        "4:35": "Now when Lysias saw his army put to flight, and the manliness of Judas’ soldiers, and how they were ready either to live or die valiantly, he went into Antiochia, and gathered together a company of strangers, and having made his army greater than it was, he purposed to come again into Judea.",
        "4:36": "Then said Judas and his brethren, Behold, our enemies are discomfited: let us go up to cleanse and dedicate the sanctuary.",
        "4:37": "Upon this all the host assembled themselves together, and went up into mount Sion.",
        "4:38": "And when they saw the sanctuary desolate, and the altar profaned, and the gates burned up, and shrubs growing in the courts as in a forest, or in one of the mountains, yea, and the priests’ chambers pulled down;",
        "4:39": "They rent their clothes, and made great lamentation, and cast ashes upon their heads,",
        "4:40": "And fell down flat to the ground upon their faces, and blew an alarm with the trumpets, and cried toward heaven.",
        "4:41": "Then Judas appointed certain men to fight against those that were in the fortress, until he had cleansed the sanctuary.",
        "4:42": "So he chose priests of blameless conversation, such as had pleasure in the law:",
        "4:43": "Who cleansed the sanctuary, and bare out the defiled stones into an unclean place.",
        "4:44": "And when as they consulted what to do with the altar of burnt offerings, which was profaned;",
        "4:45": "They thought it best to pull it down, lest it should be a reproach to them, because the heathen had defiled it: wherefore they pulled it down,",
        "4:46": "And laid up the stones in the mountain of the temple in a convenient place, until there should come a prophet to shew what should be done with them.",
        "4:47": "Then they took whole stones according to the law, and built a new altar according to the former;",
        "4:48": "And made up the sanctuary, and the things that were within the temple, and hallowed the courts.",
        "4:49": "They made also new holy vessels, and into the temple they brought the candlestick, and the altar of burnt offerings, and of incense, and the table.",
        "4:50": "And upon the altar they burned incense, and the lamps that were upon the candlestick they lighted, that they might give light in the temple.",
        "4:51": "Furthermore they set the loaves upon the table, and spread out the veils, and finished all the works which they had begun to make.",
        "4:52": "Now on the five and twentieth day of the ninth month, which is called the month Casleu, in the hundred forty and eighth year, they rose up betimes in the morning,",
        "4:53": "And offered sacrifice according to the law upon the new altar of burnt offerings, which they had made.",
        "4:54": "Look, at what time and what day the heathen had profaned it, even in that was it dedicated with songs, and citherns, and harps, and cymbals.",
        "4:55": "Then all the people fell upon their faces, worshipping and praising the God of heaven, who had given them good success.",
        "4:56": "And so they kept the dedication of the altar eight days and offered burnt offerings with gladness, and sacrificed the sacrifice of deliverance and praise.",
        "4:57": "They decked also the forefront of the temple with crowns of gold, and with shields; and the gates and the chambers they renewed, and hanged doors upon them.",
        "4:58": "Thus was there very great gladness among the people, for that the reproach of the heathen was put away.",
        "4:59": "Moreover Judas and his brethren with the whole congregation of Israel ordained, that the days of the dedication of the altar should be kept in their season from year to year by the space of eight days, from the five and twentieth day of the month Casleu, with mirth and gladness.",
        "4:60": "At that time also they builded up the mount Sion with high walls and strong towers round about, lest the Gentiles should come and tread it down as they had done before.",
        "4:61": "And they set there a garrison to keep it, and fortified Bethsura to preserve it; that the people might have a defence against Idumea.",
        "5:1": "Now when the nations round about heard that the altar was built and the sanctuary renewed as before, it displeased them very much.",
        "5:2": "Wherefore they thought to destroy the generation of Jacob that was among them, and thereupon they began to slay and destroy the people.",
        "5:3": "Then Judas fought against the children of Esau in Idumea at Arabattine, because they besieged Gael: and he gave them a great overthrow, and abated their courage, and took their spoils.",
        "5:4": "Also he remembered the injury of the children of Bean, who had been a snare and an offence unto the people, in that they lay in wait for them in the ways.",
        "5:5": "He shut them up therefore in the towers, and encamped against them, and destroyed them utterly, and burned the towers of that place with fire, and all that were therein.",
        "5:6": "Afterward he passed over to the children of Ammon, where he found a mighty power, and much people, with Timotheus their captain.",
        "5:7": "So he fought many battles with them, till at length they were discomfited before him; and he smote them.",
        "5:8": "And when he had taken Jazar, with the towns belonging thereto, he returned into Judea.",
        "5:9": "Then the heathen that were at Galaad assembled themselves together against the Israelites that were in their quarters, to destroy them; but they fled to the fortress of Dathema.",
        "5:10": "And sent letters unto Judas and his brethren, The heathen that are round about us are assembled together against us to destroy us:",
        "5:11": "And they are preparing to come and take the fortress whereunto we are fled, Timotheus being captain of their host.",
        "5:12": "Come now therefore, and deliver us from their hands, for many of us are slain:",
        "5:13": "Yea, all our brethren that were in the places of Tobie are put to death: their wives and their children also they have carried away captives, and borne away their stuff; and they have destroyed there about a thousand men.",
        "5:14": "While these letters were yet reading, behold, there came other messengers from Galilee with their clothes rent, who reported on this wise,",
        "5:15": "And said, They of Ptolemais, and of Tyrus, and Sidon, and all Galilee of the Gentiles, are assembled together against us to consume us.",
        "5:16": "Now when Judas and the people heard these words, there assembled a great congregation together, to consult what they should do for their brethren, that were in trouble, and assaulted of them.",
        "5:17": "Then said Judas unto Simon his brother, Choose thee out men, and go and deliver thy brethren that are in Galilee, for I and Jonathan my brother will go into the country of Galaad.",
        "5:18": "So he left Joseph the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, captains of the people, with the remnant of the host in Judea to keep it.",
        "5:19": "Unto whom he gave commandment, saying, Take ye the charge of this people, and see that ye make not war against the heathen until the time that we come again.",
        "5:20": "Now unto Simon were given three thousand men to go into Galilee, and unto Judas eight thousand men for the country of Galaad.",
        "5:21": "Then went Simon into Galilee, where he fought many battles with the heathen, so that the heathen were discomfited by him.",
        "5:22": "And he pursued them unto the gate of Ptolemais; and there were slain of the heathen about three thousand men, whose spoils he took.",
        "5:23": "And those that were in Galilee, and in Arbattis, with their wives and their children, and all that they had, took he away with him, and brought them into Judea with great joy.",
        "5:24": "Judas Maccabeus also and his brother Jonathan went over Jordan, and travelled three days’ journey in the wilderness,",
        "5:25": "Where they met with the Nabathites, who came unto them in a peaceable manner, and told them every thing that had happened to their brethren in the land of Galaad:",
        "5:26": "And how that many of them were shut up in Bosora, and Bosor, and Alema, Casphor, Maked, and Carnaim; all these cities are strong and great:",
        "5:27": "And that they were shut up in the rest of the cities of the country of Galaad, and that against to morrow they had appointed to bring their host against the forts, and to take them, and to destroy them all in one day.",
        "5:28": "Hereupon Judas and his host turned suddenly by the way of the wilderness unto Bosora; and when he had won the city, he slew all the males with the edge of the sword, and took all their spoils, and burned the city with fire,",
        "5:29": "From whence he removed by night, and went till he came to the fortress.",
        "5:30": "And betimes in the morning they looked up, and, behold, there was an innumerable people bearing ladders and other engines of war, to take the fortress: for they assaulted them.",
        "5:31": "When Judas therefore saw that the battle was begun, and that the cry of the city went up to heaven, with trumpets, and a great sound,",
        "5:32": "He said unto his host, Fight this day for your brethren.",
        "5:33": "So he went forth behind them in three companies, who sounded their trumpets, and cried with prayer.",
        "5:34": "Then the host of Timotheus, knowing that it was Maccabeus, fled from him: wherefore he smote them with a great slaughter; so that there were killed of them that day about eight thousand men.",
        "5:35": "This done, Judas turned aside to Maspha; and after he had assaulted it he took and slew all the males therein, and received the spoils thereof and and burnt it with fire.",
        "5:36": "From thence went he, and took Casphon, Maged, Bosor, and the other cities of the country of Galaad.",
        "5:37": "After these things gathered Timotheus another host and encamped against Raphon beyond the brook.",
        "5:38": "So Judas sent men to espy the host, who brought him word, saying, All the heathen that be round about us are assembled unto them, even a very great host.",
        "5:39": "He hath also hired the Arabians to help them and they have pitched their tents beyond the brook, ready to come and fight against thee. Upon this Judas went to meet them.",
        "5:40": "Then Timotheus said unto the captains of his host, When Judas and his host come near the brook, if he pass over first unto us, we shall not be able to withstand him; for he will mightily prevail against us:",
        "5:41": "But if he be afraid, and camp beyond the river, we shall go over unto him, and prevail against him.",
        "5:42": "Now when Judas came near the brook, he caused the scribes of the people to remain by the brook: unto whom he gave commandment, saying, Suffer no man to remain in the camp, but let all come to the battle.",
        "5:43": "So he went first over unto them, and all the people after him: then all the heathen, being discomfited before him, cast away their weapons, and fled unto the temple that was at Carnaim.",
        "5:44": "But they took the city, and burned the temple with all that were therein. Thus was Carnaim subdued, neither could they stand any longer before Judas.",
        "5:45": "Then Judas gathered together all the Israelites that were in the country of Galaad, from the least unto the greatest, even their wives, and their children, and their stuff, a very great host, to the end they might come into the land of Judea.",
        "5:46": "Now when they came unto Ephron, (this was a great city in the way as they should go, very well fortified) they could not turn from it, either on the right hand or the left, but must needs pass through the midst of it.",
        "5:47": "Then they of the city shut them out, and stopped up the gates with stones.",
        "5:48": "Whereupon Judas sent unto them in peaceable manner, saying, Let us pass through your land to go into our own country, and none shall do you any hurt; we will only pass through on foot: howbeit they would not open unto him.",
        "5:49": "Wherefore Judas commanded a proclamation to be made throughout the host, that every man should pitch his tent in the place where he was.",
        "5:50": "So the soldiers pitched, and assaulted the city all that day and all that night, till at the length the city was delivered into his hands:",
        "5:51": "Who then slew all the males with the edge of the sword, and rased the city, and took the spoils thereof, and passed through the city over them that were slain.",
        "5:52": "After this went they over Jordan into the great plain before Bethsan.",
        "5:53": "And Judas gathered together those that came behind, and exhorted the people all the way through, till they came into the land of Judea.",
        "5:54": "So they went up to mount Sion with joy and gladness, where they offered burnt offerings, because not one of them were slain until they had returned in peace.",
        "5:55": "Now what time as Judas and Jonathan were in the land of Galaad, and Simon his brother in Galilee before Ptolemais,",
        "5:56": "Joseph the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, captains of the garrisons, heard of the valiant acts and warlike deeds which they had done.",
        "5:57": "Wherefore they said, Let us also get us a name, and go fight against the heathen that are round about us.",
        "5:58": "So when they had given charge unto the garrison that was with them, they went toward Jamnia.",
        "5:59": "Then came Gorgias and his men out of the city to fight against them.",
        "5:60": "And so it was, that Joseph and Azaras were put to flight, and pursued unto the borders of Judea: and there were slain that day of the people of Israel about two thousand men.",
        "5:61": "Thus was there a great overthrow among the children of Israel, because they were not obedient unto Judas and his brethren, but thought to do some valiant act.",
        "5:62": "Moreover these men came not of the seed of those, by whose hand deliverance was given unto Israel.",
        "5:63": "Howbeit the man Judas and his brethren were greatly renowned in the sight of all Israel, and of all the heathen, wheresoever their name was heard of;",
        "5:64": "Insomuch as the the people assembled unto them with joyful acclamations.",
        "5:65": "Afterward went Judas forth with his brethren, and fought against the children of Esau in the land toward the south, where he smote Hebron, and the towns thereof, and pulled down the fortress of it, and burned the towers thereof round about.",
        "5:66": "From thence he removed to go into the land of the Philistines, and passed through Samaria.",
        "5:67": "At that time certain priests, desirous to shew their valour, were slain in battle, for that they went out to fight unadvisedly.",
        "5:68": "So Judas turned to Azotus in the land of the Philistines, and when he had pulled down their altars, and burned their carved images with fire, and spoiled their cities, he returned into the land of Judea.",
        "6:1": "About that time king Antiochus travelling through the high countries heard say, that Elymais in the country of Persia was a city greatly renowned for riches, silver, and gold;",
        "6:2": "And that there was in it a very rich temple, wherein were coverings of gold, and breastplates, and shields, which Alexander, son of Philip, the Macedonian king, who reigned first among the Grecians, had left there.",
        "6:3": "Wherefore he came and sought to take the city, and to spoil it; but he was not able, because they of the city, having had warning thereof,",
        "6:4": "Rose up against him in battle: so he fled, and departed thence with great heaviness, and returned to Babylon.",
        "6:5": "Moreover there came one who brought him tidings into Persia, that the armies, which went against the land of Judea, were put to flight:",
        "6:6": "And that Lysias, who went forth first with a great power was driven away of the Jews; and that they were made strong by the armour, and power, and store of spoils, which they had gotten of the armies, whom they had destroyed:",
        "6:7": "Also that they had pulled down the abomination, which he had set up upon the altar in Jerusalem, and that they had compassed about the sanctuary with high walls, as before, and his city Bethsura.",
        "6:8": "Now when the king heard these words, he was astonished and sore moved: whereupon he laid him down upon his bed, and fell sick for grief, because it had not befallen him as he looked for.",
        "6:9": "And there he continued many days: for his grief was ever more and more, and he made account that he should die.",
        "6:10": "Wherefore he called for all his friends, and said unto them, The sleep is gone from mine eyes, and my heart faileth for very care.",
        "6:11": "And I thought with myself, Into what tribulation am I come, and how great a flood of misery is it, wherein now I am! for I was bountiful and beloved in my power.",
        "6:12": "But now I remember the evils that I did at Jerusalem, and that I took all the vessels of gold and silver that were therein, and sent to destroy the inhabitants of Judea without a cause.",
        "6:13": "I perceive therefore that for this cause these troubles are come upon me, and, behold, I perish through great grief in a strange land.",
        "6:14": "Then called he for Philip, one of his friends, who he made ruler over all his realm,",
        "6:15": "And gave him the crown, and his robe, and his signet, to the end he should bring up his son Antiochus, and nourish him up for the kingdom.",
        "6:16": "So king Antiochus died there in the hundred forty and ninth year.",
        "6:17": "Now when Lysias knew that the king was dead, he set up Antiochus his son, whom he had brought up being young, to reign in his stead, and his name he called Eupator.",
        "6:18": "About this time they that were in the tower shut up the Israelites round about the sanctuary, and sought always their hurt, and the strengthening of the heathen.",
        "6:19": "Wherefore Judas, purposing to destroy them, called all the people together to besiege them.",
        "6:20": "So they came together, and besieged them in the hundred and fiftieth year, and he made mounts for shot against them, and other engines.",
        "6:21": "Howbeit certain of them that were besieged got forth, unto whom some ungodly men of Israel joined themselves:",
        "6:22": "And they went unto the king, and said, How long will it be ere thou execute judgment, and avenge our brethren?",
        "6:23": "We have been willing to serve thy father, and to do as he would have us, and to obey his commandments;",
        "6:24": "For which cause they of our nation besiege the tower, and are alienated from us: moreover as many of us as they could light on they slew, and spoiled our inheritance.",
        "6:25": "Neither have they stretched out their hand against us only, but also against their borders.",
        "6:26": "And, behold, this day are they besieging the tower at Jerusalem, to take it: the sanctuary also and Bethsura have they fortified.",
        "6:27": "Wherefore if thou dost not prevent them quickly, they will do the greater things than these, neither shalt thou be able to rule them.",
        "6:28": "Now when the king heard this, he was angry, and gathered together all his friends, and the captains of his army, and those that had charge of the horse.",
        "6:29": "There came also unto him from other kingdoms, and from isles of the sea, bands of hired soldiers.",
        "6:30": "So that the number of his army was an hundred thousand footmen, and twenty thousand horsemen, and two and thirty elephants exercised in battle.",
        "6:31": "These went through Idumea, and pitched against Bethsura, which they assaulted many days, making engines of war; but they of Bethsura came out, and burned them with fire, and fought valiantly.",
        "6:32": "Upon this Judas removed from the tower, and pitched in Bathzacharias, over against the king’s camp.",
        "6:33": "Then the king rising very early marched fiercely with his host toward Bathzacharias, where his armies made them ready to battle, and sounded the trumpets.",
        "6:34": "And to the end they might provoke the elephants to fight, they shewed them the blood of grapes and mulberries.",
        "6:35": "Moreover they divided the beasts among the armies, and for every elephant they appointed a thousand men, armed with coats of mail, and with helmets of brass on their heads; and beside this, for every beast were ordained five hundred horsemen of the best.",
        "6:36": "These were ready at every occasion: wheresoever the beast was, and whithersoever the beast went, they went also, neither departed they from him.",
        "6:37": "And upon the beasts were there strong towers of wood, which covered every one of them, and were girt fast unto them with devices: there were also upon every one two and thirty strong men, that fought upon them, beside the Indian that ruled him.",
        "6:38": "As for the remnant of the horsemen, they set them on this side and that side at the two parts of the host giving them signs what to do, and being harnessed all over amidst the ranks.",
        "6:39": "Now when the sun shone upon the shields of gold and brass, the mountains glistered therewith, and shined like lamps of fire.",
        "6:40": "So part of the king’s army being spread upon the high mountains, and part on the valleys below, they marched on safely and in order.",
        "6:41": "Wherefore all that heard the noise of their multitude, and the marching of the company, and the rattling of the harness, were moved: for the army was very great and mighty.",
        "6:42": "Then Judas and his host drew near, and entered into battle, and there were slain of the king’s army six hundred men.",
        "6:43": "Eleazar also, surnamed Savaran, perceiving that one of the beasts, armed with royal harness, was higher than all the rest, and supposing that the king was upon him,",
        "6:44": "Put himself in jeopardy, to the end he might deliver his people, and get him a perpetual name:",
        "6:45": "Wherefore he ran upon him courageously through the midst of the battle, slaying on the right hand and on the left, so that they were divided from him on both sides.",
        "6:46": "Which done, he crept under the elephant, and thrust him under, and slew him: whereupon the elephant fell down upon him, and there he died.",
        "6:47": "Howbeit the rest of the Jews seeing the strength of the king, and the violence of his forces, turned away from them.",
        "6:48": "Then the king’s army went up to Jerusalem to meet them, and the king pitched his tents against Judea, and against mount Sion.",
        "6:49": "But with them that were in Bethsura he made peace: for they came out of the city, because they had no victuals there to endure the siege, it being a year of rest to the land.",
        "6:50": "So the king took Bethsura, and set a garrison there to keep it.",
        "6:51": "As for the sanctuary, he besieged it many days: and set there artillery with engines and instruments to cast fire and stones, and pieces to cast darts and slings.",
        "6:52": "Whereupon they also made engines against their engines, and held them battle a long season.",
        "6:53": "Yet at the last, their vessels being without victuals, (for that it was the seventh year, and they in Judea that were delivered from the Gentiles, had eaten up the residue of the store;)",
        "6:54": "There were but a few left in the sanctuary, because the famine did so prevail against them, that they were fain to disperse themselves, every man to his own place.",
        "6:55": "At that time Lysias heard say, that Philip, whom Antiochus the king, whiles he lived, had appointed to bring up his son Antiochus, that he might be king,",
        "6:56": "Was returned out of Persia and Media, and the king’s host also that went with him, and that he sought to take unto him the ruling of the affairs.",
        "6:57": "Wherefore he went in all haste, and said to the king and the captains of the host and the company, We decay daily, and our victuals are but small, and the place we lay siege unto is strong, and the affairs of the kingdom lie upon us:",
        "6:58": "Now therefore let us be friends with these men, and make peace with them, and with all their nation;",
        "6:59": "And covenant with them, that they shall live after their laws, as they did before: for they are therefore displeased, and have done all these things, because we abolished their laws.",
        "6:60": "So the king and the princes were content: wherefore he sent unto them to make peace; and they accepted thereof.",
        "6:61": "Also the king and the princes made an oath unto them: whereupon they went out of the strong hold.",
        "6:62": "Then the king entered into mount Sion; but when he saw the strength of the place, he broke his oath that he had made, and gave commandment to pull down the wall round about.",
        "6:63": "Afterward departed he in all haste, and returned unto Antiochia, where he found Philip to be master of the city: so he fought against him, and took the city by force.",
        "7:1": "In the hundred and one and fiftieth year Demetrius the son of Seleucus departed from Rome, and came up with a few men unto a city of the sea coast, and reigned there.",
        "7:2": "And as he entered into the palace of his ancestors, so it was, that his forces had taken Antiochus and Lysias, to bring them unto him.",
        "7:3": "Wherefore, when he knew it, he said, Let me not see their faces.",
        "7:4": "So his host slew them. Now when Demetrius was set upon the throne of his kingdom,",
        "7:5": "There came unto him all the wicked and ungodly men of Israel, having Alcimus, who was desirous to be high priest, for their captain:",
        "7:6": "And they accused the people to the king, saying, Judas and his brethren have slain all thy friends, and driven us out of our own land.",
        "7:7": "Now therefore send some man whom thou trustest, and let him go and see what havock he hath made among us, and in the king’s land, and let him punish them with all them that aid them.",
        "7:8": "Then the king chose Bacchides, a friend of the king, who ruled beyond the flood, and was a great man in the kingdom, and faithful to the king,",
        "7:9": "And him he sent with that wicked Alcimus, whom he made high priest, and commanded that he should take vengeance of the children of Israel.",
        "7:10": "So they departed, and came with a great power into the land of Judea, where they sent messengers to Judas and his brethren with peaceable words deceitfully.",
        "7:11": "But they gave no heed to their words; for they saw that they were come with a great power.",
        "7:12": "Then did there assemble unto Alcimus and Bacchides a company of scribes, to require justice.",
        "7:13": "Now the Assideans were the first among the children of Israel that sought peace of them:",
        "7:14": "For said they, One that is a priest of the seed of Aaron is come with this army, and he will do us no wrong.",
        "7:15": "So he spake unto them, peaceably, and sware unto them, saying, we will procure the harm neither of you nor your friends.",
        "7:16": "Whereupon they believed him: howbeit he took of them threescore men, and slew them in one day, according to the words which he wrote,",
        "7:17": "The flesh of thy saints have they cast out, and their blood have they shed round about Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them.",
        "7:18": "Wherefore the fear and dread of them fell upon all the people, who said, There is neither truth nor righteousness in them; for they have broken the covenant and oath that they made.",
        "7:19": "After this, removed Bacchides from Jerusalem, and pitched his tents in Bezeth, where he sent and took many of the men that had forsaken him, and certain of the people also, and when he had slain them, he cast them into the great pit.",
        "7:20": "Then committed he the country to Alcimus, and left with him a power to aid him: so Bacchides went to the king.",
        "7:21": "But Alcimus contended for the high priesthood.",
        "7:22": "And unto him resorted all such as troubled the people, who, after they had gotten the land of Juda into their power, did much hurt in Israel.",
        "7:23": "Now when Judas saw all the mischief that Alcimus and his company had done among the Israelites, even above the heathen,",
        "7:24": "He went out into all the coasts of Judea round about, and took vengeance of them that had revolted from him, so that they durst no more go forth into the country.",
        "7:25": "On the other side, when Alcimus saw that Judas and his company had gotten the upper hand, and knew that he was not able to abide their force, he went again to the king, and said all the worst of them that he could.",
        "7:26": "Then the king sent Nicanor, one of his honourable princes, a man that bare deadly hate unto Israel, with commandment to destroy the people.",
        "7:27": "So Nicanor came to Jerusalem with a great force; and sent unto Judas and his brethren deceitfully with friendly words, saying,",
        "7:28": "Let there be no battle between me and you; I will come with a few men, that I may see you in peace.",
        "7:29": "He came therefore to Judas, and they saluted one another peaceably. Howbeit the enemies were prepared to take away Judas by violence.",
        "7:30": "Which thing after it was known to Judas, to wit, that he came unto him with deceit, he was sore afraid of him, and would see his face no more.",
        "7:31": "Nicanor also, when he saw that his counsel was discovered, went out to fight against Judas beside Capharsalama:",
        "7:32": "Where there were slain of Nicanor’s side about five thousand men, and the rest fled into the city of David.",
        "7:33": "After this went Nicanor up to mount Sion, and there came out of the sanctuary certain of the priests and certain of the elders of the people, to salute him peaceably, and to shew him the burnt sacrifice that was offered for the king.",
        "7:34": "But he mocked them, and laughed at them, and abused them shamefully, and spake proudly,",
        "7:35": "And sware in his wrath, saying, Unless Judas and his host be now delivered into my hands, if ever I come again in safety, I will burn up this house: and with that he went out in a great rage.",
        "7:36": "Then the priests entered in, and stood before the altar and the temple, weeping, and saying,",
        "7:37": "Thou, O Lord, didst choose this house to be called by thy name, and to be a house of prayer and petition for thy people:",
        "7:38": "Be avenged of this man and his host, and let them fall by the sword: remember their blasphemies, and suffer them not to continue any longer.",
        "7:39": "So Nicanor went out of Jerusalem, and pitched his tents in Bethhoron, where an host out of Syria met him.",
        "7:40": "But Judas pitched in Adasa with three thousand men, and there he prayed, saying,",
        "7:41": "O Lord, when they that were sent from the king of the Assyrians blasphemed, thine angel went out, and smote an hundred fourscore and five thousand of them.",
        "7:42": "Even so destroy thou this host before us this day, that the rest may know that he hath spoken blasphemously against thy sanctuary, and judge thou him according to his wickedness.",
        "7:43": "So the thirteenth day of the month Adar the hosts joined battle: but Nicanor’s host was discomfited, and he himself was first slain in the battle.",
        "7:44": "Now when Nicanor’s host saw that he was slain, they cast away their weapons, and fled.",
        "7:45": "Then they pursued after them a day’s journey, from Adasa unto Gazera, sounding an alarm after them with their trumpets.",
        "7:46": "Whereupon they came forth out of all the towns of Judea round about, and closed them in; so that they, turning back upon them that pursued them, were all slain with the sword, and not one of them was left.",
        "7:47": "Afterwards they took the spoils, and the prey, and smote off Nicanors head, and his right hand, which he stretched out so proudly, and brought them away, and hanged them up toward Jerusalem.",
        "7:48": "For this cause the people rejoiced greatly, and they kept that day a day of great gladness.",
        "7:49": "Moreover they ordained to keep yearly this day, being the thirteenth of Adar.",
        "7:50": "Thus the land of Juda was in rest a little while.",
        "8:1": "Now Judas had heard of the the Romans, that they were mighty and valiant men, and such as would lovingly accept all that joined themselves unto them, and make a league of amity with all that came unto them;",
        "8:2": "And that they were men of great valour. It was told him also of their wars and noble acts which they had done among the Galatians, and how they had conquered them, and brought them under tribute;",
        "8:3": "And what they had done in the country of Spain, for the winning of the mines of the silver and gold which is there;",
        "8:4": "And that by their policy and patience they had conquered all the place, though it were very far from them; and the kings also that came against them from the uttermost part of the earth, till they had discomfited them, and given them a great overthrow, so that the rest did give them tribute every year:",
        "8:5": "Beside this, how they had discomfited in battle Philip, and Perseus, king of the Citims, with others that lifted up themselves against them, and had overcome them:",
        "8:6": "How also Antiochus the great king of Asia, that came against them in battle, having an hundred and twenty elephants, with horsemen, and chariots, and a very great army, was discomfited by them;",
        "8:7": "And how they took him alive, and covenanted that he and such as reigned after him should pay a great tribute, and give hostages, and that which was agreed upon,",
        "8:8": "And the country of India, and Media and Lydia and of the goodliest countries, which they took of him, and gave to king Eumenes:",
        "8:9": "Moreover how the Grecians had determined to come and destroy them;",
        "8:10": "And that they, having knowledge thereof sent against them a certain captain, and fighting with them slew many of them, and carried away captives their wives and their children, and spoiled them, and took possession of their lands, and pulled down their strong holds, and brought them to be their servants unto this day:",
        "8:11": "It was told him besides, how they destroyed and brought under their dominion all other kingdoms and isles that at any time resisted them;",
        "8:12": "But with their friends and such as relied upon them they kept amity: and that they had conquered kingdoms both far and nigh, insomuch as all that heard of their name were afraid of them:",
        "8:13": "Also that, whom they would help to a kingdom, those reign; and whom again they would, they displace: finally, that they were greatly exalted:",
        "8:14": "Yet for all this none of them wore a crown or was clothed in purple, to be magnified thereby:",
        "8:15": "Moreover how they had made for themselves a senate house, wherein three hundred and twenty men sat in council daily, consulting alway for the people, to the end they might be well ordered:",
        "8:16": "And that they committed their government to one man every year, who ruled over all their country, and that all were obedient to that one, and that there was neither envy nor emmulation among them.",
        "8:17": "In consideration of these things, Judas chose Eupolemus the son of John, the son of Accos, and Jason the son of Eleazar, and sent them to Rome, to make a league of amity and confederacy with them,",
        "8:18": "And to intreat them that they would take the yoke from them; for they saw that the kingdom of the Grecians did oppress Israel with servitude.",
        "8:19": "They went therefore to Rome, which was a very great journey, and came into the senate, where they spake and said.",
        "8:20": "Judas Maccabeus with his brethren, and the people of the Jews, have sent us unto you, to make a confederacy and peace with you, and that we might be registered your confederates and friends.",
        "8:21": "So that matter pleased the Romans well.",
        "8:22": "And this is the copy of the epistle which the senate wrote back again in tables of brass, and sent to Jerusalem, that there they might have by them a memorial of peace and confederacy:",
        "8:23": "Good success be to the Romans, and to the people of the Jews, by sea and by land for ever: the sword also and enemy be far from them,",
        "8:24": "If there come first any war upon the Romans or any of their confederates throughout all their dominion,",
        "8:25": "The people of the Jews shall help them, as the time shall be appointed, with all their heart:",
        "8:26": "Neither shall they give any thing unto them that make war upon them, or aid them with victuals, weapons, money, or ships, as it hath seemed good unto the Romans; but they shall keep their covenants without taking any thing therefore.",
        "8:27": "In the same manner also, if war come first upon the nation of the Jews, the Romans shall help them with all their heart, according as the time shall be appointed them:",
        "8:28": "Neither shall victuals be given to them that take part against them, or weapons, or money, or ships, as it hath seemed good to the Romans; but they shall keep their covenants, and that without deceit.",
        "8:29": "According to these articles did the Romans make a covenant with the people of the Jews.",
        "8:30": "Howbeit if hereafter the one party or the other shall think to meet to add or diminish any thing, they may do it at their pleasures, and whatsoever they shall add or take away shall be ratified.",
        "8:31": "And as touching the evils that Demetrius doeth to the Jews, we have written unto him, saying, Wherefore thou made thy yoke heavy upon our friends and confederates the Jews?",
        "8:32": "If therefore they complain any more against thee, we will do them justice, and fight with thee by sea and by land.",
        "9:1": "Furthermore, when Demetrius heard the Nicanor and his host were slain in battle, he sent Bacchides and Alcimus into the land of Judea the second time, and with them the chief strength of his host:",
        "9:2": "Who went forth by the way that leadeth to Galgala, and pitched their tents before Masaloth, which is in Arbela, and after they had won it, they slew much people.",
        "9:3": "Also the first month of the hundred fifty and second year they encamped before Jerusalem:",
        "9:4": "From whence they removed, and went to Berea, with twenty thousand footmen and two thousand horsemen.",
        "9:5": "Now Judas had pitched his tents at Eleasa, and three thousand chosen men with him:",
        "9:6": "Who seeing the multitude of the other army to he so great were sore afraid; whereupon many conveyed themselves out of the host, insomuch as abode of them no more but eight hundred men.",
        "9:7": "When Judas therefore saw that his host slipt away, and that the battle pressed upon him, he was sore troubled in mind, and much distressed, for that he had no time to gather them together.",
        "9:8": "Nevertheless unto them that remained he said, Let us arise and go up against our enemies, if peradventure we may be able to fight with them.",
        "9:9": "But they dehorted him, saying, We shall never be able: let us now rather save our lives, and hereafter we will return with our brethren, and fight against them: for we are but few.",
        "9:10": "Then Judas said, God forbid that I should do this thing, and flee away from them: if our time be come, let us die manfully for our brethren, and let us not stain our honour.",
        "9:11": "With that the host of Bacchides removed out of their tents, and stood over against them, their horsemen being divided into two troops, and their slingers and archers going before the host and they that marched in the foreward were all mighty men.",
        "9:12": "As for Bacchides, he was in the right wing: so the host drew near on the two parts, and sounded their trumpets.",
        "9:13": "They also of Judas’ side, even they sounded their trumpets also, so that the earth shook at the noise of the armies, and the battle continued from morning till night.",
        "9:14": "Now when Judas perceived that Bacchides and the strength of his army were on the right side, he took with him all the hardy men,",
        "9:15": "Who discomfited the right wing, and pursued them unto the mount Azotus.",
        "9:16": "But when they of the left wing saw that they of the right wing were discomfited, they followed upon Judas and those that were with him hard at the heels from behind:",
        "9:17": "Whereupon there was a sore battle, insomuch as many were slain on both parts.",
        "9:18": "Judas also was killed, and the remnant fled.",
        "9:19": "THen Jonathan and Simon took Judas their brother, and buried him in the sepulchre of his fathers in Modin.",
        "9:20": "Moreover they bewailed him, and all Israel made great lamentation for him, and mourned many days, saying,",
        "9:21": "How is the valiant man fallen, that delivered Israel!",
        "9:22": "As for the other things concerning Judas and his wars, and the noble acts which he did, and his greatness, they are not written: for they were very many.",
        "9:23": "Now after the death of Judas the wicked began to put forth their heads in all the coasts of Israel, and there arose up all such as wrought iniquity.",
        "9:24": "In those days also was there a very great famine, by reason whereof the country revolted, and went with them.",
        "9:25": "Then Bacchides chose the wicked men, and made them lords of the country.",
        "9:26": "And they made enquiry and search for Judas’ friends, and brought them unto Bacchides, who took vengeance of them, and used them despitefully.",
        "9:27": "So was there a great affliction in Israel, the like whereof was not since the time that a prophet was not seen among them.",
        "9:28": "For this cause all Judas’ friends came together, and said unto Jonathan,",
        "9:29": "Since thy brother Judas died, we have no man like him to go forth against our enemies, and Bacchides, and against them of our nation that are adversaries to us.",
        "9:30": "Now therefore we have chosen thee this day to be our prince and captain in his stead, that thou mayest fight our battles.",
        "9:31": "Upon this Jonathan took the governance upon him at that time, and rose up instead of his brother Judas.",
        "9:32": "But when Bacchides gat knowledge thereof, he sought for to slay him",
        "9:33": "Then Jonathan, and Simon his brother, and all that were with him, perceiving that, fled into the wilderness of Thecoe, and pitched their tents by the water of the pool Asphar.",
        "9:34": "Which when Bacchides understood, he came near to Jordan with all his host upon the sabbath day.",
        "9:35": "Now Jonathan had sent his brother John, a captain of the people, to pray his friends the Nabathites, that they might leave with them their carriage, which was much.",
        "9:36": "But the children of Jambri came out of Medaba, and took John, and all that he had, and went their way with it.",
        "9:37": "After this came word to Jonathan and Simon his brother, that the children of Jambri made a great marriage, and were bringing the bride from Nadabatha with a great train, as being the daughter of one of the great princes of Chanaan.",
        "9:38": "Therefore they remembered John their brother, and went up, and hid themselves under the covert of the mountain:",
        "9:39": "Where they lifted up their eyes, and looked, and, behold, there was much ado and great carriage: and the bridegroom came forth, and his friends and brethren, to meet them with drums, and instruments of musick, and many weapons.",
        "9:40": "Then Jonathan and they that were with him rose up against them from the place where they lay in ambush, and made a slaughter of them in such sort, as many fell down dead, and the remnant fled into the mountain, and they took all their spoils.",
        "9:41": "Thus was the marriage turned into mourning, and the noise of their melody into lamentation.",
        "9:42": "So when they had avenged fully the blood of their brother, they turned again to the marsh of Jordan.",
        "9:43": "Now when Bacchides heard hereof, he came on the sabbath day unto the banks of Jordan with a great power.",
        "9:44": "Then Jonathan said to his company, Let us go up now and fight for our lives, for it standeth not with us to day, as in time past:",
        "9:45": "For, behold, the battle is before us and behind us, and the water of Jordan on this side and that side, the marsh likewise and wood, neither is there place for us to turn aside.",
        "9:46": "Wherefore cry ye now unto heaven, that ye may be delivered from the hand of your enemies.",
        "9:47": "With that they joined battle, and Jonathan stretched forth his hand to smite Bacchides, but he turned back from him.",
        "9:48": "Then Jonathan and they that were with him leapt into Jordan, and swam over unto the other bank: howbeit the other passed not over Jordan unto them.",
        "9:49": "So there were slain of Bacchides’ side that day about a thousand men.",
        "9:50": "Afterward returned Bacchides to Jerusalem and repaired the strong cites in Judea; the fort in Jericho, and Emmaus, and Bethhoron, and Bethel, and Thamnatha, Pharathoni, and Taphon, these did he strengthen with high walls, with gates and with bars.",
        "9:51": "And in them he set a garrison, that they might work malice upon Israel.",
        "9:52": "He fortified also the city Bethsura, and Gazera, and the tower, and put forces in them, and provision of victuals.",
        "9:53": "Besides, he took the chief men’s sons in the country for hostages, and put them into the tower at Jerusalem to be kept.",
        "9:54": "Moreover in the hundred fifty and third year, in the second month, Alcimus commanded that the wall of the inner court of the sanctuary should be pulled down; he pulled down also the works of the prophets",
        "9:55": "And as he began to pull down, even at that time was Alcimus plagued, and his enterprizes hindered: for his mouth was stopped, and he was taken with a palsy, so that he could no more speak any thing, nor give order concerning his house.",
        "9:56": "So Alcimus died at that time with great torment.",
        "9:57": "Now when Bacchides saw that Alcimus was dead, he returned to the king: whereupon the land of Judea was in rest two years.",
        "9:58": "Then all the ungodly men held a council, saying, Behold, Jonathan and his company are at ease, and dwell without care: now therefore we will bring Bacchides hither, who shall take them all in one night.",
        "9:59": "So they went and consulted with him.",
        "9:60": "Then removed he, and came with a great host, and sent letters privily to his adherents in Judea, that they should take Jonathan and those that were with him: howbeit they could not, because their counsel was known unto them.",
        "9:61": "Wherefore they took of the men of the country, that were authors of that mischief, about fifty persons, and slew them.",
        "9:62": "Afterward Jonathan, and Simon, and they that were with him, got them away to Bethbasi, which is in the wilderness, and they repaired the decays thereof, and made it strong.",
        "9:63": "Which thing when Bacchides knew, he gathered together all his host, and sent word to them that were of Judea.",
        "9:64": "Then went he and laid siege against Bethbasi; and they fought against it a long season and made engines of war.",
        "9:65": "But Jonathan left his brother Simon in the city, and went forth himself into the country, and with a certain number went he forth.",
        "9:66": "And he smote Odonarkes and his brethren, and the children of Phasiron in their tent.",
        "9:67": "And when he began to smite them, and came up with his forces, Simon and his company went out of the city, and burned up the engines of war,",
        "9:68": "And fought against Bacchides, who was discomfited by them, and they afflicted him sore: for his counsel and travail was in vain.",
        "9:69": "Wherefore he was very wroth at the wicked men that gave him counsel to come into the country, inasmuch as he slew many of them, and purposed to return into his own country.",
        "9:70": "Whereof when Jonathan had knowledge, he sent ambassadors unto him, to the end he should make peace with him, and deliver them the prisoners.",
        "9:71": "Which thing he accepted, and did according to his demands, and sware unto him that he would never do him harm all the days of his life.",
        "9:72": "When therefore he had restored unto him the prisoners that he had taken aforetime out of the land of Judea, he returned and went his way into his own land, neither came he any more into their borders.",
        "9:73": "Thus the sword ceased from Israel: but Jonathan dwelt at Machmas, and began to govern the people; and he destroyed the ungodly men out of Israel.",
        "10:1": "In the hundred and sixtieth year Alexander, the son of Antiochus surnamed Epiphanes, went up and took Ptolemais: for the people had received him, by means whereof he reigned there,",
        "10:2": "Now when king Demetrius heard thereof, he gathered together an exceeding great host, and went forth against him to fight.",
        "10:3": "Moreover Demetrius sent letters unto Jonathan with loving words, so as he magnified him.",
        "10:4": "For said he, Let us first make peace with him, before he join with Alexander against us:",
        "10:5": "Else he will remember all the evils that we have done against him, and against his brethren and his people.",
        "10:6": "Wherefore he gave him authority to gather together an host, and to provide weapons, that he might aid him in battle: he commanded also that the hostages that were in the tower should be delivered him.",
        "10:7": "Then came Jonathan to Jerusalem, and read the letters in the audience of all the people, and of them that were in the tower:",
        "10:8": "Who were sore afraid, when they heard that the king had given him authority to gather together an host.",
        "10:9": "Whereupon they of the tower delivered their hostages unto Jonathan, and he delivered them unto their parents.",
        "10:10": "This done, Jonathan settled himself in Jerusalem, and began to build and repair the city.",
        "10:11": "And he commanded the workmen to build the walls and the mount Sion and about with square stones for fortification; and they did so.",
        "10:12": "Then the strangers, that were in the fortresses which Bacchides had built, fled away;",
        "10:13": "Insomuch as every man left his place, and went into his own country.",
        "10:14": "Only at Bethsura certain of those that had forsaken the law and the commandments remained still: for it was their place of refuge.",
        "10:15": "Now when king Alexander had heard what promises Demetrius had sent unto Jonathan: when also it was told him of the battles and noble acts which he and his brethren had done, and of the pains that they had endured,",
        "10:16": "He said, Shall we find such another man? now therefore we will make him our friend and confederate.",
        "10:17": "Upon this he wrote a letter, and sent it unto him, according to these words, saying,",
        "10:18": "King Alexander to his brother Jonathan sendeth greeting:",
        "10:19": "We have heard of thee, that thou art a man of great power, and meet to be our friend.",
        "10:20": "Wherefore now this day we ordain thee to be the high priest of thy nation, and to be called the king’s friend; (and therewithal he sent him a purple robe and a crown of gold:) and require thee to take our part, and keep friendship with us.",
        "10:21": "So in the seventh month of the hundred and sixtieth year, at the feast of the tabernacles, Jonathan put on the holy robe, and gathered together forces, and provided much armour.",
        "10:22": "Whereof when Demetrius heard, he was very sorry, and said,",
        "10:23": "What have we done, that Alexander hath prevented us in making amity with the Jews to strengthen himself?",
        "10:24": "I also will write unto them words of encouragement, and promise them dignities and gifts, that I may have their aid.",
        "10:25": "He sent unto them therefore to this effect: King Demetrius unto the people of the Jews sendeth greeting:",
        "10:26": "Whereas ye have kept covenants with us, and continued in our friendship, not joining yourselves with our enemies, we have heard hereof, and are glad.",
        "10:27": "Wherefore now continue ye still to be faithful unto us, and we will well recompense you for the things ye do in our behalf,",
        "10:28": "And will grant you many immunities, and give you rewards.",
        "10:29": "And now do I free you, and for your sake I release all the Jews, from tributes, and from the customs of salt, and from crown taxes,",
        "10:30": "And from that which appertaineth unto me to receive for the third part or the seed, and the half of the fruit of the trees, I release it from this day forth, so that they shall not be taken of the land of Judea, nor of the three governments which are added thereunto out of the country of Samaria and Galilee, from this day forth for evermore.",
        "10:31": "Let Jerusalem also be holy and free, with the borders thereof, both from tenths and tributes.",
        "10:32": "And as for the tower which is at Jerusalem, I yield up authority over it, and give the high priest, that he may set in it such men as he shall choose to keep it.",
        "10:33": "Moreover I freely set at liberty every one of the Jews, that were carried captives out of the land of Judea into any part of my kingdom, and I will that all my officers remit the tributes even of their cattle.",
        "10:34": "Furthermore I will that all the feasts, and sabbaths, and new moons, and solemn days, and the three days before the feast, and the three days after the feast shall be all of immunity and freedom for all the Jews in my realm.",
        "10:35": "Also no man shall have authority to meddle with or to molest any of them in any matter.",
        "10:36": "I will further, that there be enrolled among the king’s forces about thirty thousand men of the Jews, unto whom pay shall be given, as belongeth to all king’s forces.",
        "10:37": "And of them some shall be placed in the king’s strong holds, of whom also some shall be set over the affairs of the kingdom, which are of trust: and I will that their overseers and governors be of themselves, and that they live after their own laws, even as the king hath commanded in the land of Judea.",
        "10:38": "And concerning the three governments that are added to Judea from the country of Samaria, let them be joined with Judea, that they may be reckoned to be under one, nor bound to obey other authority than the high priest’s.",
        "10:39": "As for Ptolemais, and the land pertaining thereto, I give it as a free gift to the sanctuary at Jerusalem for the necessary expences of the sanctuary.",
        "10:40": "Moreover I give every year fifteen thousand shekels of silver out of the king’s accounts from the places appertaining.",
        "10:41": "And all the overplus, which the officers payed not in as in former time, from henceforth shall be given toward the works of the temple.",
        "10:42": "And beside this, the five thousand shekels of silver, which they took from the uses of the temple out of the accounts year by year, even those things shall be released, because they appertain to the priests that minister.",
        "10:43": "And whosoever they be that flee unto the temple at Jerusalem, or be within the liberties hereof, being indebted unto the king, or for any other matter, let them be at liberty, and all that they have in my realm.",
        "10:44": "For the building also and repairing of the works of the sanctuary expences shall be given of the king’s accounts.",
        "10:45": "Yea, and for the building of the walls of Jerusalem, and the fortifying thereof round about, expences shall be given out of the king’s accounts, as also for the building of the walls in Judea.",
        "10:46": "Now when Jonathan and the people heard these words, they gave no credit unto them, nor received them, because they remembered the great evil that he had done in Israel; for he had afflicted them very sore.",
        "10:47": "But with Alexander they were well pleased, because he was the first that entreated of true peace with them, and they were confederate with him always.",
        "10:48": "Then gathered king Alexander great forces, and camped over against Demetrius.",
        "10:49": "And after the two kings had joined battle, Demetrius’ host fled: but Alexander followed after him, and prevailed against them.",
        "10:50": "And he continued the battle very sore until the sun went down: and that day was Demetrius slain.",
        "10:51": "Afterward Alexander sent ambassadors to Ptolemee king of Egypt with a message to this effect:",
        "10:52": "Forasmuch as I am come again to my realm, and am set in the throne of my progenitors, and have gotten the dominion, and overthrown Demetrius, and recovered our country;",
        "10:53": "For after I had joined battle with him, both he and his host was discomfited by us, so that we sit in the throne of his kingdom:",
        "10:54": "Now therefore let us make a league of amity together, and give me now thy daughter to wife: and I will be thy son in law, and will give both thee and her as according to thy dignity.",
        "10:55": "Then Ptolemee the king gave answer, saying, Happy be the day wherein thou didst return into the land of thy fathers, and satest in the throne of their kingdom.",
        "10:56": "And now will I do to thee, as thou hast written: meet me therefore at Ptolemais, that we may see one another; for I will marry my daughter to thee according to thy desire.",
        "10:57": "So Ptolemee went out of Egypt with his daughter Cleopatra, and they came unto Ptolemais in the hundred threescore and second year:",
        "10:58": "Where king Alexander meeting him, he gave unto him his daughter Cleopatra, and celebrated her marriage at Ptolemais with great glory, as the manner of kings is.",
        "10:59": "Now king Alexander had written unto Jonathan, that he should come and meet him.",
        "10:60": "Who thereupon went honourably to Ptolemais, where he met the two kings, and gave them and their friends silver and gold, and many presents, and found favour in their sight.",
        "10:61": "At that time certain pestilent fellows of Israel, men of a wicked life, assembled themselves against him, to accuse him: but the king would not hear them.",
        "10:62": "Yea more than that, the king commanded to take off his garments, and clothe him in purple: and they did so.",
        "10:63": "And he made him sit by himself, and said into his princes, Go with him into the midst of the city, and make proclamation, that no man complain against him of any matter, and that no man trouble him for any manner of cause.",
        "10:64": "Now when his accusers saw that he was honored according to the proclamation, and clothed in purple, they fled all away.",
        "10:65": "So the king honoured him, and wrote him among his chief friends, and made him a duke, and partaker of his dominion.",
        "10:66": "Afterward Jonathan returned to Jerusalem with peace and gladness.",
        "10:67": "Furthermore in the; hundred threescore and fifth year came Demetrius son of Demetrius out of Crete into the land of his fathers:",
        "10:68": "Whereof when king Alexander heard tell, he was right sorry, and returned into Antioch.",
        "10:69": "Then Demetrius made Apollonius the governor of Celosyria his general, who gathered together a great host, and camped in Jamnia, and sent unto Jonathan the high priest, saying,",
        "10:70": "Thou alone liftest up thyself against us, and I am laughed to scorn for thy sake, and reproached: and why dost thou vaunt thy power against us in the mountains?",
        "10:71": "Now therefore, if thou trustest in thine own strength, come down to us into the plain field, and there let us try the matter together: for with me is the power of the cities.",
        "10:72": "Ask and learn who I am, and the rest that take our part, and they shall tell thee that thy foot is not able to to flight in their own land.",
        "10:73": "Wherefore now thou shalt not be able to abide the horsemen and so great a power in the plain, where is neither stone nor flint, nor place to flee unto.",
        "10:74": "So when Jonathan heard these words of Apollonius, he was moved in his mind, and choosing ten thousand men he went out of Jerusalem, where Simon his brother met him for to help him.",
        "10:75": "And he pitched his tents against Joppa: but; they of Joppa shut him out of the city, because Apollonius had a garrison there.",
        "10:76": "Then Jonathan laid siege unto it: whereupon they of the city let him in for fear: and so Jonathan won Joppa.",
        "10:77": "Whereof when Apollonius heard, he took three thousand horsemen, with a great host of footmen, and went to Azotus as one that journeyed, and therewithal drew him forth into the plain. because he had a great number of horsemen, in whom he put his trust.",
        "10:78": "Then Jonathan followed after him to Azotus, where the armies joined battle.",
        "10:79": "Now Apollonius had left a thousand horsemen in ambush.",
        "10:80": "And Jonathan knew that there was an ambushment behind him; for they had compassed in his host, and cast darts at the people, from morning till evening.",
        "10:81": "But the people stood still, as Jonathan had commanded them: and so the enemies’ horses were tired.",
        "10:82": "Then brought Simon forth his host, and set them against the footmen, (for the horsemen were spent) who were discomfited by him, and fled.",
        "10:83": "The horsemen also, being scattered in the field, fled to Azotus, and went into Bethdagon, their idol’s temple, for safety.",
        "10:84": "But Jonathan set fire on Azotus, and the cities round about it, and took their spoils; and the temple of Dagon, with them that were fled into it, he burned with fire.",
        "10:85": "Thus there were burned and slain with the sword well nigh eight thousand men.",
        "10:86": "And from thence Jonathan removed his host, and camped against Ascalon, where the men of the city came forth, and met him with great pomp.",
        "10:87": "After this returned Jonathan and his host unto Jerusalem, having any spoils.",
        "10:88": "Now when king ALexander heard these things, he honoured Jonathan yet more.",
        "10:89": "And sent him a buckle of gold, as the use is to be given to such as are of the king’s blood: he gave him also Accaron with the borders thereof in possession.",
        "11:1": "And the king of Egypt gathered together a great host, like the sand that lieth upon the sea shore, and many ships, and went about through deceit to get Alexander’s kingdom, and join it to his own.",
        "11:2": "Whereupon he took his journey into Spain in peaceable manner, so as they of the cities opened unto him, and met him: for king Alexander had commanded them so to do, because he was his brother in law.",
        "11:3": "Now as Ptolemee entered into the cities, he set in every one of them a garrison of soldiers to keep it.",
        "11:4": "And when he came near to Azotus, they shewed him the temple of Dagon that was burnt, and Azotus and the suburbs thereof that were destroyed, and the bodies that were cast abroad and them that he had burnt in the battle; for they had made heaps of them by the way where he should pass.",
        "11:5": "Also they told the king whatsoever Jonathan had done, to the intent he might blame him: but the king held his peace.",
        "11:6": "Then Jonathan met the king with great pomp at Joppa, where they saluted one another, and lodged.",
        "11:7": "Afterward Jonathan, when he had gone with the king to the river called Eleutherus, returned again to Jerusalem.",
        "11:8": "King Ptolemee therefore, having gotten the dominion of the cities by the sea unto Seleucia upon the sea coast, imagined wicked counsels against Alexander.",
        "11:9": "Whereupon he sent ambasadors unto king Demetrius, saying, Come, let us make a league betwixt us, and I will give thee my daughter whom Alexander hath, and thou shalt reign in thy father’s kingdom:",
        "11:10": "For I repent that I gave my daughter unto him, for he sought to slay me.",
        "11:11": "Thus did he slander him, because he was desirous of his kingdom.",
        "11:12": "Wherefore he took his daughter from him, and gave her to Demetrius, and forsook Alexander, so that their hatred was openly known.",
        "11:13": "Then Ptolemee entered into Antioch, where he set two crowns upon his head, the crown of Asia, and of Egypt.",
        "11:14": "In the mean season was king Alexander in Cilicia, because those that dwelt in those parts had revolted from him.",
        "11:15": "But when Alexander heard of this, he came to war against him: whereupon king Ptolemee brought forth his host, and met him with a mighty power, and put him to flight.",
        "11:16": "So Alexander fled into Arabia there to be defended; but king Ptolemee was exalted:",
        "11:17": "For Zabdiel the Arabian took off Alexander’s head, and sent it unto Ptolemee.",
        "11:18": "King Ptolemee also died the third day after, and they that were in the strong holds were slain one of another.",
        "11:19": "By this means Demetrius reigned in the hundred threescore and seventh year.",
        "11:20": "At the same time Jonathan gathered together them that were in Judea to take the tower that was in Jerusalem: and he made many engines of war against it.",
        "11:21": "Then came ungodly persons, who hated their own people, went unto the king, and told him that Jonathan besieged the tower,",
        "11:22": "Whereof when he heard, he was angry, and immediately removing, he came to Ptolemais, and wrote unto Jonathan, that he should not lay siege to the tower, but come and speak with him at Ptolemais in great haste.",
        "11:23": "Nevertheless Jonathan, when he heard this, commanded to besiege it still: and he chose certain of the elders of Israel and the priests, and put himself in peril;",
        "11:24": "And took silver and gold, and raiment, and divers presents besides, and went to Ptolemais unto the king, where he found favour in his sight.",
        "11:25": "And though certain ungodly men of the people had made complaints against him,",
        "11:26": "Yet the king entreated him as his predecessors had done before, and promoted him in the sight of all his friends,",
        "11:27": "And confirmed him in the high priesthood, and in all the honours that he had before, and gave him preeminence among his chief friends.",
        "11:28": "Then Jonathan desired the king, that he would make Judea free from tribute, as also the three governments, with the country of Samaria; and he promised him three hundred talents.",
        "11:29": "So the king consented, and wrote letters unto Jonathan of all these things after this manner:",
        "11:30": "King Demetrius unto his brother Jonathan, and unto the nation of the Jews, sendeth greeting:",
        "11:31": "We send you here a copy of the letter which we did write unto our cousin Lasthenes concerning you, that ye might see it.",
        "11:32": "King Demetrius unto his father Lasthenes sendeth greeting:",
        "11:33": "We are determined to do good to the people of the Jews, who are our friends, and keep covenants with us, because of their good will toward us.",
        "11:34": "Wherefore we have ratified unto them the borders of Judea, with the three governments of Apherema and Lydda and Ramathem, that are added unto Judea from the country of Samaria, and all things appertaining unto them, for all such as do sacrifice in Jerusalem, instead of the payments which the king received of them yearly aforetime out of the fruits of the earth and of trees.",
        "11:35": "And as for other things that belong unto us, of the tithes and customs pertaining unto us, as also the saltpits, and the crown taxes, which are due unto us, we discharge them of them all for their relief.",
        "11:36": "And nothing hereof shall be revoked from this time forth for ever.",
        "11:37": "Now therefore see that thou make a copy of these things, and let it be delivered unto Jonathan, and set upon the holy mount in a conspicuous place.",
        "11:38": "After this, when king Demetrius saw that the land was quiet before him, and that no resistance was made against him, he sent away all his forces, every one to his own place, except certain bands of strangers, whom he had gathered from the isles of the heathen: wherefore all the forces of his fathers hated him.",
        "11:39": "Moreover there was one Tryphon, that had been of Alexander’s part afore, who, seeing that all the host murmured against Demetrius, went to Simalcue the Arabian that brought up Antiochus the young son of Alexander,",
        "11:40": "And lay sore upon him to deliver him this young Antiochus, that he might reign in his father’s stead: he told him therefore all that Demetrius had done, and how his men of war were at enmity with him, and there he remained a long season.",
        "11:41": "In the mean time Jonathan sent unto king Demetrius, that he would cast those of the tower out of Jerusalem, and those also in the fortresses: for they fought against Israel.",
        "11:42": "So Demetrius sent unto Jonathan, saying, I will not only do this for thee and thy people, but I will greatly honour thee and thy nation, if opportunity serve.",
        "11:43": "Now therefore thou shalt do well, if thou send me men to help me; for all my forces are gone from me.",
        "11:44": "Upon this Jonathan sent him three thousand strong men unto Antioch: and when they came to the king, the king was very glad of their coming.",
        "11:45": "Howbeit they that were of the city gathered themselves together into the midst of the city, to the number of an hundred and twenty thousand men, and would have slain the king.",
        "11:46": "Wherefore the king fled into the court, but they of the city kept the passages of the city, and began to fight.",
        "11:47": "Then the king called to the Jews for help, who came unto him all at once, and dispersing themselves through the city slew that day in the city to the number of an hundred thousand.",
        "11:48": "Also they set fire on the city, and gat many spoils that day, and delivered the king.",
        "11:49": "So when they of the city saw that the Jews had got the city as they would, their courage was abated: wherefore they made supplication to the king, and cried, saying,",
        "11:50": "Grant us peace, and let the Jews cease from assaulting us and the city.",
        "11:51": "With that they cast away their weapons, and made peace; and the Jews were honoured in the sight of the king, and in the sight of all that were in his realm; and they returned to Jerusalem, having great spoils.",
        "11:52": "So king Demetrius sat on the throne of his kingdom, and the land was quiet before him.",
        "11:53": "Nevertheless he dissembled in all that ever he spake, and estranged himself from Jonathan, neither rewarded he him according to the benefits which he had received of him, but troubled him very sore.",
        "11:54": "After this returned Tryphon, and with him the young child Antiochus, who reigned, and was crowned.",
        "11:55": "Then there gathered unto him all the men of war, whom Demetrius had put away, and they fought against Demetrius, who turned his back and fled.",
        "11:56": "Moreover Tryphon took the elephants, and won Antioch.",
        "11:57": "At that time young Antiochus wrote unto Jonathan, saying, I confirm thee in the high priesthood, and appoint thee ruler over the four governments, and to be one of the king’s friends.",
        "11:58": "Upon this he sent him golden vessels to be served in, and gave him leave to drink in gold, and to be clothed in purple, and to wear a golden buckle.",
        "11:59": "His brother Simon also he made captain from the place called The ladder of Tyrus unto the borders of Egypt.",
        "11:60": "Then Jonathan went forth, and passed through the cities beyond the water, and all the forces of Syria gathered themselves unto him for to help him: and when he came to Ascalon, they of the city met him honourably.",
        "11:61": "From whence he went to Gaza, but they of Gaza shut him out; wherefore he laid siege unto it, and burned the suburbs thereof with fire, and spoiled them.",
        "11:62": "Afterward, when they of Gaza made supplication unto Jonathan, he made peace with them, and took the sons of their chief men for hostages, and sent them to Jerusalem, and passed through the country unto Damascus.",
        "11:63": "Now when Jonathan heard that Demetrius’ princes were come to Cades, which is in Galilee, with a great power, purposing to remove him out of the country,",
        "11:64": "He went to meet them, and left Simon his brother in the country.",
        "11:65": "Then Simon encamped against Bethsura and fought against it a long season, and shut it up:",
        "11:66": "But they desired to have peace with him, which he granted them, and then put them out from thence, and took the city, and set a garrison in it.",
        "11:67": "As for Jonathan and his host, they pitched at the water of Gennesar, from whence betimes in the morning they gat them to the plain of Nasor.",
        "11:68": "And, behold, the host of strangers met them in the plain, who, having laid men in ambush for him in the mountains, came themselves over against him.",
        "11:69": "So when they that lay in ambush rose out of their places and joined battle, all that were of Jonathan’s side fled;",
        "11:70": "Insomuch as there was not one of them left, except Mattathias the son of Absalom, and Judas the son of Calphi, the captains of the host.",
        "11:71": "Then Jonathan rent his clothes, and cast earth upon his head, and prayed.",
        "11:72": "Afterwards turning again to battle, he put them to flight, and so they ran away.",
        "11:73": "Now when his own men that were fled saw this, they turned again unto him, and with him pursued them to Cades, even unto their own tents, and there they camped.",
        "11:74": "So there were slain of the heathen that day about three thousand men: but Jonathan returned to Jerusalem.",
        "12:1": "Now when Jonathan saw that time served him, he chose certain men, and sent them to Rome, for to confirm and renew the friendship that they had with them.",
        "12:2": "He sent letters also to the Lacedemonians, and to other places, for the same purpose.",
        "12:3": "So they went unto Rome, and entered into the senate, and said, Jonathan the high priest, and the people of the Jews, sent us unto you, to the end ye should renew the friendship, which ye had with them, and league, as in former time.",
        "12:4": "Upon this the Romans gave them letters unto the governors of every place that they should bring them into the land of Judea peaceably.",
        "12:5": "And this is the copy of the letters which Jonathan wrote to the Lacedemonians:",
        "12:6": "Jonathan the high priest, and the elders of the nation, and the priests, and the other of the Jews, unto the Lacedemonians their brethren send greeting:",
        "12:7": "There were letters sent in times past unto Onias the high priest from Darius, who reigned then among you, to signify that ye are our brethren, as the copy here underwritten doth specify.",
        "12:8": "At which time Onias entreated the ambassador that was sent honourably, and received the letters, wherein declaration was made of the league and friendship.",
        "12:9": "Therefore we also, albeit we need none of these things, that we have the holy books of scripture in our hands to comfort us,",
        "12:10": "Have nevertheless attempted to send unto you for the renewing of brotherhood and friendship, lest we should become strangers unto you altogether: for there is a long time passed since ye sent unto us.",
        "12:11": "We therefore at all times without ceasing, both in our feasts, and other convenient days, do remember you in the sacrifices which we offer, and in our prayers, as reason is, and as it becometh us to think upon our brethren:",
        "12:12": "And we are right glad of your honour.",
        "12:13": "As for ourselves, we have had great troubles and wars on every side, forsomuch as the kings that are round about us have fought against us.",
        "12:14": "Howbeit we would not be troublesome unto you, nor to others of our confederates and friends, in these wars:",
        "12:15": "For we have help from heaven that succoureth us, so as we are delivered from our enemies, and our enemies are brought under foot.",
        "12:16": "For this cause we chose Numenius the son of Antiochus, and Antipater he son of Jason, and sent them unto the Romans, to renew the amity that we had with them, and the former league.",
        "12:17": "We commanded them also to go unto you, and to salute and to deliver you our letters concerning the renewing of our brotherhood.",
        "12:18": "Wherefore now ye shall do well to give us an answer thereto.",
        "12:19": "And this is the copy of the letters which Oniares sent.",
        "12:20": "Areus king of the Lacedemonians to Onias the high priest, greeting:",
        "12:21": "It is found in writing, that the Lacedemonians and Jews are brethren, and that they are of the stock of Abraham:",
        "12:22": "Now therefore, since this is come to our knowledge, ye shall do well to write unto us of your prosperity.",
        "12:23": "We do write back again to you, that your cattle and goods are our’s, and our’s are your’s We do command therefore our ambassadors to make report unto you on this wise.",
        "12:24": "Now when Jonathan heard that Demebius’ princes were come to fight against him with a greater host than afore,",
        "12:25": "He removed from Jerusalem, and met them in the land of Amathis: for he gave them no respite to enter his country.",
        "12:26": "He sent spies also unto their tents, who came again, and told him that they were appointed to come upon them in the night season.",
        "12:27": "Wherefore so soon as the sun was down, Jonathan commanded his men to watch, and to be in arms, that all the night long they might be ready to fight: also he sent forth centinels round about the host.",
        "12:28": "But when the adversaries heard that Jonathan and his men were ready for battle, they feared, and trembled in their hearts, and they kindled fires in their camp.",
        "12:29": "Howbeit Jonathan and his company knew it not till the morning: for they saw the lights burning.",
        "12:30": "Then Jonathan pursued after them, but overtook them not: for they were gone over the river Eleutherus.",
        "12:31": "Wherefore Jonathan turned to the Arabians, who were called Zabadeans, and smote them, and took their spoils.",
        "12:32": "And removing thence, he came to Damascus, and so passed through all the country,",
        "12:33": "Simon also went forth, and passed through the country unto Ascalon, and the holds there adjoining, from whence he turned aside to Joppa, and won it.",
        "12:34": "For he had heard that they would deliver the hold unto them that took Demetrius’ part; wherefore he set a garrison there to keep it.",
        "12:35": "After this came Jonathan home again, and calling the elders of the people together, he consulted with them about building strong holds in Judea,",
        "12:36": "And making the walls of Jerusalem higher, and raising a great mount between the tower and the city, for to separate it from the city, that so it might be alone, that men might neither sell nor buy in it.",
        "12:37": "Upon this they came together to build up the city, forasmuch as part of the wall toward the brook on the east side was fallen down, and they repaired that which was called Caphenatha.",
        "12:38": "Simon also set up Adida in Sephela, and made it strong with gates and bars.",
        "12:39": "Now Tryphon went about to get the kingdom of Asia, and to kill Antiochus the king, that he might set the crown upon his own head.",
        "12:40": "Howbeit he was afraid that Jonathan would not suffer him, and that he would fight against him; wherefore he sought a way how to take Jonathan, that he might kill him. So he removed, and came to Bethsan.",
        "12:41": "Then Jonathan went out to meet him with forty thousand men chosen for the battle, and came to Bethsan.",
        "12:42": "Now when Tryphon saw Jonathan came with so great a force, he durst not stretch his hand against him;",
        "12:43": "But received him honourably, and commended him unto all his friends, and gave him gifts, and commanded his men of war to be as obedient unto him, as to himself.",
        "12:44": "Unto Jonathan also he said, Why hast thou brought all this people to so great trouble, seeing there is no war betwixt us?",
        "12:45": "Therefore send them now home again, and choose a few men to wait on thee, and come thou with me to Ptolemais, for I will give it thee, and the rest of the strong holds and forces, and all that have any charge: as for me, I will return and depart: for this is the cause of my coming.",
        "12:46": "So Jonathan believing him did as he bade him, and sent away his host, who went into the land of Judea.",
        "12:47": "And with himself he retained but three thousand men, of whom he sent two thousand into Galilee, and one thousand went with him.",
        "12:48": "Now as soon as Jonathan entered into Ptolemais, they of Ptolemais shut the gates and took him, and all them that came with him they slew with the sword.",
        "12:49": "Then sent Tryphon an host of footmen and horsemen into Galilee, and into the great plain, to destroy all Jonathan’s company.",
        "12:50": "But when they knew that Jonathan and they that were with him were taken and slain, they encouraged one another; and went close together, prepared to fight.",
        "12:51": "They therefore that followed upon them, perceiving that they were ready to fight for their lives, turned back again.",
        "12:52": "Whereupon they all came into the land of Judea peaceably, and there they bewailed Jonathan, and them that were with him, and they were sore afraid; wherefore all Israel made great lamentation.",
        "12:53": "Then all the heathen that were round about then sought to destroy them: for said they, They have no captain, nor any to help them: now therefore let us make war upon them, and take away their memorial from among men.",
        "13:1": "Now when Simon heard that Tryphon had gathered together a great host to invade the land of Judea, and destroy it,",
        "13:2": "And saw that the people was in great trembling and fear, he went up to Jerusalem, and gathered the people together,",
        "13:3": "And gave them exhortation, saying, Ye yourselves know what great things I, and my brethren, and my father’s house, have done for the laws and the sanctuary, the battles also and troubles which we have seen.",
        "13:4": "By reason whereof all my brethren are slain for Israel’s sake, and I am left alone.",
        "13:5": "Now therefore be it far from me, that I should spare mine own life in any time of trouble: for I am no better than my brethren.",
        "13:6": "Doubtless I will avenge my nation, and the sanctuary, and our wives, and our children: for all the heathen are gathered to destroy us of very malice.",
        "13:7": "Now as soon as the people heard these words, their spirit revived.",
        "13:8": "And they answered with a loud voice, saying, Thou shalt be our leader instead of Judas and Jonathan thy brother.",
        "13:9": "Fight thou our battles, and whatsoever, thou commandest us, that will we do.",
        "13:10": "So then he gathered together all the men of war, and made haste to finish the walls of Jerusalem, and he fortified it round about.",
        "13:11": "Also he sent Jonathan the son of Absolom, and with him a great power, to Joppa: who casting out them that were therein remained there in it.",
        "13:12": "So Tryphon removed from Ptolemaus with a great power to invade the land of Judea, and Jonathan was with him in ward.",
        "13:13": "But Simon pitched his tents at Adida, over against the plain.",
        "13:14": "Now when Tryphon knew that Simon was risen up instead of his brother Jonathan, and meant to join battle with him, he sent messengers unto him, saying,",
        "13:15": "Whereas we have Jonathan thy brother in hold, it is for money that he is owing unto the king’s treasure, concerning the business that was committed unto him.",
        "13:16": "Wherefore now send an hundred talents of silver, and two of his sons for hostages, that when he is at liberty he may not revolt from us, and we will let him go.",
        "13:17": "Hereupon Simon, albeit he perceived that they spake deceitfully unto him yet sent he the money and the children, lest peradventure he should procure to himself great hatred of the people:",
        "13:18": "Who might have said, Because I sent him not the money and the children, therefore is Jonathan dead.",
        "13:19": "So he sent them the children and the hundred talents: howbeit Tryphon dissembled neither would he let Jonathan go.",
        "13:20": "And after this came Tryphon to invade the land, and destroy it, going round about by the way that leadeth unto Adora: but Simon and his host marched against him in every place, wheresoever he went.",
        "13:21": "Now they that were in the tower sent messengers unto Tryphon, to the end that he should hasten his coming unto them by the wilderness, and send them victuals.",
        "13:22": "Wherefore Tryphon made ready all his horsemen to come that night: but there fell a very great snow, by reason whereof he came not. So he departed, and came into the country of Galaad.",
        "13:23": "And when he came near to Bascama he slew Jonathan, who was buried there.",
        "13:24": "Afterward Tryphon returned and went into his own land.",
        "13:25": "Then sent Simon, and took the bones of Jonathan his brother, and buried them in Modin, the city of his fathers.",
        "13:26": "And all Israel made great lamentation for him, and bewailed him many days.",
        "13:27": "Simon also built a monument upon the sepulchre of his father and his brethren, and raised it aloft to the sight, with hewn stone behind and before.",
        "13:28": "Moreover he set up seven pyramids, one against another, for his father, and his mother, and his four brethren.",
        "13:29": "And in these he made cunning devices, about the which he set great pillars, and upon the pillars he made all their armour for a perpetual memory, and by the armour ships carved, that they might be seen of all that sail on the sea.",
        "13:30": "This is the sepulchre which he made at Modin, and it standeth yet unto this day.",
        "13:31": "Now Tryphon dealt deceitfully with the young king Antiochus, and slew him.",
        "13:32": "And he reigned in his stead, and crowned himself king of Asia, and brought a great calamity upon the land.",
        "13:33": "Then Simon built up the strong holds in Judea, and fenced them about with high towers, and great walls, and gates, and bars, and laid up victuals therein.",
        "13:34": "Moreover Simon chose men, and sent to king Demetrius, to the end he should give the land an immunity, because all that Tryphon did was to spoil.",
        "13:35": "Unto whom king Demetrius answered and wrote after this manner:",
        "13:36": "King Demetrius unto Simon the high priest, and friend of kings, as also unto the elders and nation of the Jews, sendeth greeting:",
        "13:37": "The golden crown, and the scarlet robe, which ye sent unto us, we have received: and we are ready to make a stedfast peace with you, yea, and to write unto our officers, to confirm the immunities which we have granted.",
        "13:38": "And whatsoever covenants we have made with you shall stand; and the strong holds, which ye have builded, shall be your own.",
        "13:39": "As for any oversight or fault committed unto this day, we forgive it, and the crown tax also, which ye owe us: and if there were any other tribute paid in Jerusalem, it shall no more be paid.",
        "13:40": "And look who are meet among you to be in our court, let then be enrolled, and let there be peace betwixt us.",
        "13:41": "Thus the yoke of the heathen was taken away from Israel in the hundred and seventieth year.",
        "13:42": "Then the people of Israel began to write in their instruments and contracts, In the first year of Simon the high priest, the governor and leader of the Jews.",
        "13:43": "In those days Simon camped against Gaza and besieged it round about; he made also an engine of war, and set it by the city, and battered a certain tower, and took it.",
        "13:44": "And they that were in the engine leaped into the city; whereupon there was a great uproar in the city:",
        "13:45": "Insomuch as the people of the city rent their clothes, and climbed upon the walls with their wives and children, and cried with a loud voice, beseeching Simon to grant them peace.",
        "13:46": "And they said, Deal not with us according to our wickedness, but according to thy mercy.",
        "13:47": "So Simon was appeased toward them, and fought no more against them, but put them out of the city, and cleansed the houses wherein the idols were, and so entered into it with songs and thanksgiving.",
        "13:48": "Yea, he put all uncleanness out of it, and placed such men there as would keep the law, and made it stronger than it was before, and built therein a dwellingplace for himself.",
        "13:49": "They also of the tower in Jerusalem were kept so strait, that they could neither come forth, nor go into the country, nor buy, nor sell: wherefore they were in great distress for want of victuals, and a great number of them perished through famine.",
        "13:50": "Then cried they to Simon, beseeching him to be at one with them: which thing he granted them; and when he had put them out from thence, he cleansed the tower from pollutions:",
        "13:51": "And entered into it the three and twentieth day of the second month in the hundred seventy and first year, with thanksgiving, and branches of palm trees, and with harps, and cymbals, and with viols, and hymns, and songs: because there was destroyed a great enemy out of Israel.",
        "13:52": "He ordained also that that day should be kept every year with gladness. Moreover the hill of the temple that was by the tower he made stronger than it was, and there he dwelt himself with his company.",
        "13:53": "And when Simon saw that John his son was a valiant man, he made him captain of all the hosts; and he dwelt in Gazera.",
        "14:1": "Now in the hundred threescore and twelfth year king Demetrius gathered his forces together, and went into Media to get him help to fight against Tryphone.",
        "14:2": "But when Arsaces, the king of Persia and Media, heard that Demetrius was entered within his borders, he sent one of his princes to take him alive:",
        "14:3": "Who went and smote the host of Demetrius, and took him, and brought him to Arsaces, by whom he was put in ward.",
        "14:4": "As for the land of Judea, that was quiet all the days of Simon; for he sought the good of his nation in such wise, as that evermore his authority and honour pleased them well.",
        "14:5": "And as he was honourable in all his acts, so in this, that he took Joppa for an haven, and made an entrance to the isles of the sea,",
        "14:6": "And enlarged the bounds of his nation, and recovered the country,",
        "14:7": "And gathered together a great number of captives, and had the dominion of Gazera, and Bethsura, and the tower, out of the which he took all uncleaness, neither was there any that resisted him.",
        "14:8": "Then did they till their ground in peace, and the earth gave her increase, and the trees of the field their fruit.",
        "14:9": "The ancient men sat all in the streets, communing together of good things, and the young men put on glorious and warlike apparel.",
        "14:10": "He provided victuals for the cities, and set in them all manner of munition, so that his honourable name was renowned unto the end of the world.",
        "14:11": "He made peace in the land, and Israel rejoiced with great joy:",
        "14:12": "For every man sat under his vine and his fig tree, and there was none to fray them:",
        "14:13": "Neither was there any left in the land to fight against them: yea, the kings themselves were overthrown in those days.",
        "14:14": "Moreover he strengthened all those of his people that were brought low: the law he searched out; and every contemner of the law and wicked person he took away.",
        "14:15": "He beautified the sanctuary, and multiplied vessels of the temple.",
        "14:16": "Now when it was heard at Rome, and as far as Sparta, that Jonathan was dead, they were very sorry.",
        "14:17": "But as soon as they heard that his brother Simon was made high priest in his stead, and ruled the country, and the cities therein:",
        "14:18": "They wrote unto him in tables of brass, to renew the friendship and league which they had made with Judas and Jonathan his brethren:",
        "14:19": "Which writings were read before the congregation at Jerusalem.",
        "14:20": "And this is the copy of the letters that the Lacedemonians sent; The rulers of the Lacedemonians, with the city, unto Simon the high priest, and the elders, and priests, and residue of the people of the Jews, our brethren, send greeting:",
        "14:21": "The ambassadors that were sent unto our people certified us of your glory and honour: wherefore we were glad of their coming,",
        "14:22": "And did register the things that they spake in the council of the people in this manner; Numenius son of Antiochus, and Antipater son of Jason, the Jews’ ambassadors, came unto us to renew the friendship they had with us.",
        "14:23": "And it pleased the people to entertain the men honourably, and to put the copy of their ambassage in publick records, to the end the people of the Lacedemonians might have a memorial thereof: furthermore we have written a copy thereof unto Simon the high priest.",
        "14:24": "After this Simon sent Numenius to Rome with a great shield of gold of a thousand pound weight to confirm the league with them.",
        "14:25": "Whereof when the people heard, they said, What thanks shall we give to Simon and his sons?",
        "14:26": "For he and his brethren and the house of his father have established Israel, and chased away in fight their enemies from them, and confirmed their liberty.",
        "14:27": "So then they wrote it in tables of brass, which they set upon pillars in mount Sion: and this is the copy of the writing; The eighteenth day of the month Elul, in the hundred threescore and twelfth year, being the third year of Simon the high priest,",
        "14:28": "At Saramel in the great congregation of the priests, and people, and rulers of the nation, and elders of the country, were these things notified unto us.",
        "14:29": "Forasmuch as oftentimes there have been wars in the country, wherein for the maintenance of their sanctuary, and the law, Simon the son of Mattathias, of the posterity of Jarib, together with his brethren, put themselves in jeopardy, and resisting the enemies of their nation did their nation great honour:",
        "14:30": "(For after that Jonathan, having gathered his nation together, and been their high priest, was added to his people,",
        "14:31": "Their enemies prepared to invade their country, that they might destroy it, and lay hands on the sanctuary:",
        "14:32": "At which time Simon rose up, and fought for his nation, and spent much of his own substance, and armed the valiant men of his nation and gave them wages,",
        "14:33": "And fortified the cities of Judea, together with Bethsura, that lieth upon the borders of Judea, where the armour of the enemies had been before; but he set a garrison of Jews there:",
        "14:34": "Moreover he fortified Joppa, which lieth upon the sea, and Gazera, that bordereth upon Azotus, where the enemies had dwelt before: but he placed Jews there, and furnished them with all things convenient for the reparation thereof.)",
        "14:35": "The people therefore sang the acts of Simon, and unto what glory he thought to bring his nation, made him their governor and chief priest, because he had done all these things, and for the justice and faith which he kept to his nation, and for that he sought by all means to exalt his people.",
        "14:36": "For in his time things prospered in his hands, so that the heathen were taken out of their country, and they also that were in the city of David in Jerusalem, who had made themselves a tower, out of which they issued, and polluted all about the sanctuary, and did much hurt in the holy place:",
        "14:37": "But he placed Jews therein. and fortified it for the safety of the country and the city, and raised up the walls of Jerusalem.",
        "14:38": "King Demetrius also confirmed him in the high priesthood according to those things,",
        "14:39": "And made him one of his friends, and honoured him with great honour.",
        "14:40": "For he had heard say, that the Romans had called the Jews their friends and confederates and brethren; and that they had entertained the ambassadors of Simon honourably;",
        "14:41": "Also that the Jews and priests were well pleased that Simon should be their governor and high priest for ever, until there should arise a faithful prophet;",
        "14:42": "Moreover that he should be their captain, and should take charge of the sanctuary, to set them over their works, and over the country, and over the armour, and over the fortresses, that, I say, he should take charge of the sanctuary;",
        "14:43": "Beside this, that he should be obeyed of every man, and that all the writings in the country should be made in his name, and that he should be clothed in purple, and wear gold:",
        "14:44": "Also that it should be lawful for none of the people or priests to break any of these things, or to gainsay his words, or to gather an assembly in the country without him, or to be clothed in purple, or wear a buckle of gold;",
        "14:45": "And whosoever should do otherwise, or break any of these things, he should be punished.",
        "14:46": "Thus it liked all the people to deal with Simon, and to do as hath been said.",
        "14:47": "Then Simon accepted hereof, and was well pleased to be high priest, and captain and governor of the Jews and priests, and to defend them all.",
        "14:48": "So they commanded that this writing should be put in tables of brass, and that they should be set up within the compass of the sanctuary in a conspicuous place;",
        "14:49": "Also that the copies thereof should be laid up in the treasury, to the end that Simon and his sons might have them.",
        "15:1": "Moreover Antiochus son of Demetrius the king sent letters from the isles of the sea unto Simon the priest and prince of the Jews, and to all the people;",
        "15:2": "The contents whereof were these: King Antiochus to Simon the high priest and prince of his nation, and to the people of the Jews, greeting:",
        "15:3": "Forasmuch as certain pestilent men have usurped the kingdom of our fathers, and my purpose is to challenge it again, that I may restore it to the old estate, and to that end have gathered a multitude of foreign soldiers together, and prepared ships of war;",
        "15:4": "My meaning also being to go through the country, that I may be avenged of them that have destroyed it, and made many cities in the kingdom desolate:",
        "15:5": "Now therefore I confirm unto thee all the oblations which the kings before me granted thee, and whatsoever gifts besides they granted.",
        "15:6": "I give thee leave also to coin money for thy country with thine own stamp.",
        "15:7": "And as concerning Jerusalem and the sanctuary, let them be free; and all the armour that thou hast made, and fortresses that thou hast built, and keepest in thine hands, let them remain unto thee.",
        "15:8": "And if anything be, or shall be, owing to the king, let it be forgiven thee from this time forth for evermore.",
        "15:9": "Furthermore, when we have obtained our kingdom, we will honour thee, and thy nation, and thy temple, with great honour, so that your honour shall be known throughout the world.",
        "15:10": "In the hundred threescore and fourteenth year went Antiochus into the land of his fathers: at which time all the forces came together unto him, so that few were left with Tryphon.",
        "15:11": "Wherefore being pursued by king Antiochus, he fled unto Dora, which lieth by the sea side:",
        "15:12": "For he saw that troubles came upon him all at once, and that his forces had forsaken him.",
        "15:13": "Then camped Antiochus against Dora, having with him an hundred and twenty thousand men of war, and eight thousand horsemen.",
        "15:14": "And when he had compassed the city round about, and joined ships close to the town on the sea side, he vexed the city by land and by sea, neither suffered he any to go out or in.",
        "15:15": "In the mean season came Numenius and his company from Rome, having letters to the kings and countries; wherein were written these things:",
        "15:16": "Lucius, consul of the Romans unto king Ptolemee, greeting:",
        "15:17": "The Jews’ ambassadors, our friends and confederates, came unto us to renew the old friendship and league, being sent from Simon the high priest, and from the people of the Jews:",
        "15:18": "And they brought a shield of gold of a thousand pound.",
        "15:19": "We thought it good therefore to write unto the kings and countries, that they should do them no harm, nor fight against them, their cities, or countries, nor yet aid their enemies against them.",
        "15:20": "It seemed also good to us to receive the shield of them.",
        "15:21": "If therefore there be any pestilent fellows, that have fled from their country unto you, deliver them unto Simon the high priest, that he may punish them according to their own law.",
        "15:22": "The same things wrote he likewise unto Demetrius the king, and Attalus, to Ariarathes, and Arsaces,",
        "15:23": "And to all the countries and to Sampsames, and the Lacedemonians, and to Delus, and Myndus, and Sicyon, and Caria, and Samos, and Pamphylia, and Lycia, and Halicarnassus, and Rhodus, and Aradus, and Cos, and Side, and Aradus, and Gortyna, and Cnidus, and Cyprus, and Cyrene.",
        "15:24": "And the copy hereof they wrote to Simon the high priest.",
        "15:25": "So Antiochus the king camped against Dora the second day, assaulting it continually, and making engines, by which means he shut up Tryphon, that he could neither go out nor in.",
        "15:26": "At that time Simon sent him two thousand chosen men to aid him; silver also, and gold, and much armour.",
        "15:27": "Nevertheless he would not receive them, but brake all the covenants which he had made with him afore, and became strange unto him.",
        "15:28": "Furthermore he sent unto him Athenobius, one of his friends, to commune with him, and say, Ye withhold Joppa and Gazera; with the tower that is in Jerusalem, which are cities of my realm.",
        "15:29": "The borders thereof ye have wasted, and done great hurt in the land, and got the dominion of many places within my kingdom.",
        "15:30": "Now therefore deliver the cities which ye have taken, and the tributes of the places, whereof ye have gotten dominion without the borders of Judea:",
        "15:31": "Or else give me for them five hundred talents of silver; and for the harm that ye have done, and the tributes of the cities, other five hundred talents: if not, we will come and fight against you",
        "15:32": "So Athenobius the king’s friend came to Jerusalem: and when he saw the glory of Simon, and the cupboard of gold and silver plate, and his great attendance, he was astonished, and told him the king’s message.",
        "15:33": "Then answered Simon, and said unto him, We have neither taken other men’s land, nor holden that which appertaineth to others, but the inheritance of our fathers, which our enemies had wrongfully in possession a certain time.",
        "15:34": "Wherefore we, having opportunity, hold the inheritance of our fathers.",
        "15:35": "And whereas thou demandest Joppa and Gazera, albeit they did great harm unto the people in our country, yet will we give thee an hundred talents for them. Hereunto Athenobius answered him not a word;",
        "15:36": "But returned in a rage to the king, and made report unto him of these speeches, and of the glory of Simon, and of all that he had seen: whereupon the king was exceeding wroth.",
        "15:37": "In the mean time fled Tryphon by ship unto Orthosias.",
        "15:38": "Then the king made Cendebeus captain of the sea coast, and gave him an host of footmen and horsemen,",
        "15:39": "And commanded him to remove his host toward Judea; also he commanded him to build up Cedron, and to fortify the gates, and to war against the people; but as for the king himself, he pursued Tryphon.",
        "15:40": "So Cendebeus came to Jamnia and began to provoke the people and to invade Judea, and to take the people prisoners, and slay them.",
        "15:41": "And when he had built up Cedrou, he set horsemen there, and an host of footmen, to the end that issuing out they might make outroads upon the ways of Judea, as the king had commanded him.",
        "16:1": "Then came up John from Gazera, and told Simon his father what Cendebeus had done.",
        "16:2": "Wherefore Simon called his two eldest sons, Judas and John, and said unto them, I, and my brethren, and my father’s house, have ever from my youth unto this day fought against the enemies of Israel; and things have prospered so well in our hands, that we have delivered Israel oftentimes.",
        "16:3": "But now I am old, and ye, by God’s mercy, are of a sufficient age: be ye instead of me and my brother, and go and fight for our nation, and the help from heaven be with you.",
        "16:4": "So he chose out of the country twenty thousand men of war with horsemen, who went out against Cendebeus, and rested that night at Modin.",
        "16:5": "And when as they rose in the morning, and went into the plain, behold, a mighty great host both of footmen and horsemen came against them: howbeit there was a water brook betwixt them.",
        "16:6": "So he and his people pitched over against them: and when he saw that the people were afraid to go over the water brook, he went first over himself, and then the men seeing him passed through after him.",
        "16:7": "That done, he divided his men, and set the horsemen in the midst of the footmen: for the enemies’ horsemen were very many.",
        "16:8": "Then sounded they with the holy trumpets: whereupon Cendebeus and his host were put to flight, so that many of them were slain, and the remnant gat them to the strong hold.",
        "16:9": "At that time was Judas John’s brother wounded; but John still followed after them, until he came to Cedron, which Cendebeus had built.",
        "16:10": "So they fled even unto the towers in the fields of Azotus; wherefore he burned it with fire: so that there were slain of them about two thousand men. Afterward he returned into the land of Judea in peace.",
        "16:11": "Moreover in the plain of Jericho was Ptolemeus the son of Abubus made captain, and he had abundance of silver and gold:",
        "16:12": "For he was the high priest’s son in law.",
        "16:13": "Wherefore his heart being lifted up, he thought to get the country to himself, and thereupon consulted deceitfully against Simon and his sons to destroy them.",
        "16:14": "Now Simon was visiting the cities that were in the country, and taking care for the good ordering of them; at which time he came down himself to Jericho with his sons, Mattathias and Judas, in the hundred threescore and seventeenth year, in the eleventh month, called Sabat:",
        "16:15": "Where the son of Abubus receiving them deceitfully into a little hold, called Docus, which he had built, made them a great banquet: howbeit he had hid men there.",
        "16:16": "So when Simon and his sons had drunk largely, Ptolemee and his men rose up, and took their weapons, and came upon Simon into the banqueting place, and slew him, and his two sons, and certain of his servants.",
        "16:17": "In which doing he committed a great treachery, and recompensed evil for good.",
        "16:18": "Then Ptolemee wrote these things, and sent to the king, that he should send him an host to aid him, and he would deliver him the country and cities.",
        "16:19": "He sent others also to Gazera to kill John: and unto the tribunes he sent letters to come unto him, that he might give them silver, and gold, and rewards.",
        "16:20": "And others he sent to take Jerusalem, and the mountain of the temple.",
        "16:21": "Now one had run afore to Gazera and told John that his father and brethren were slain, and, quoth he, Ptolemee hath sent to slay thee also.",
        "16:22": "Hereof when he heard, he was sore astonished: so he laid hands on them that were come to destroy him, and slew them; for he knew that they sought to make him away.",
        "16:23": "As concerning the rest of the acts of John, and his wars, and worthy deeds which he did, and the building of the walls which he made, and his doings,",
        "16:24": "Behold, these are written in the chronicles of his priesthood, from the time he was made high priest after his father."

        "3:1": "Now when the holy city was inhabited with all peace, and the laws were kept very well, because of the godliness of Onias the high priest, and his hatred of wickedness,",
        "3:2": "It came to pass that even the kings themselves did honour the place, and magnify the temple with their best gifts;",
        "3:3": "Insomuch that Seleucus of Asia of his own revenues bare all the costs belonging to the service of the sacrifices.",

        "3:5": "And when he could not overcome Onias, he gat him to Apollonius the son of Thraseas, who then was governor of Celosyria and Phenice,",
        "3:6": "And told him that the treasury in Jerusalem was full of infinite sums of money, so that the multitude of their riches, which did not pertain to the account of the sacrifices, was innumerable, and that it was possible to bring all into the king’s hand.",
        "3:7": "Now when Apollonius came to the king, and had shewed him of the money whereof he was told, the king chose out Heliodorus his treasurer, and sent him with a commandment to bring him the foresaid money.",
        "3:8": "So forthwith Heliodorus took his journey; under a colour of visiting the cities of Celosyria and Phenice, but indeed to fulfil the king’s purpose.",
        "3:9": "And when he was come to Jerusalem, and had been courteously received of the high priest of the city, he told him what intelligence was given of the money, and declared wherefore he came, and asked if these things were so indeed.",
        "3:10": "Then the high priest told him that there was such money laid up for the relief of widows and fatherless children:",
        "3:11": "And that some of it belonged to Hircanus son of Tobias, a man of great dignity, and not as that wicked Simon had misinformed: the sum whereof in all was four hundred talents of silver, and two hundred of gold:",
        "3:12": "And that it was altogether impossible that such wrongs should be done unto them, that had committed it to the holiness of the place, and to the majesty and inviolable sanctity of the temple, honoured over all the world.",
        "3:13": "But Heliodorus, because of the king’s commandment given him, said, That in any wise it must be brought into the king’s treasury.",
        "3:14": "So at the day which he appointed he entered in to order this matter: wherefore there was no small agony throughout the whole city.",
        "3:15": "But the priests, prostrating themselves before the altar in their priests’ vestments, called unto heaven upon him that made a law concerning things given to he kept, that they should safely be preserved for such as had committed them to be kept.",
        "3:16": "Then whoso had looked the high priest in the face, it would have wounded his heart: for his countenance and the changing of his colour declared the inward agony of his mind.",
        "3:17": "For the man was so compassed with fear and horror of the body, that it was manifest to them that looked upon him, what sorrow he had now in his heart.",
        "3:18": "Others ran flocking out of their houses to the general supplication, because the place was like to come into contempt.",
        "3:19": "And the women, girt with sackcloth under their breasts, abounded in the streets, and the virgins that were kept in ran, some to the gates, and some to the walls, and others looked out of the windows.",
        "3:20": "And all, holding their hands toward heaven, made supplication.",
        "3:21": "Then it would have pitied a man to see the falling down of the multitude of all sorts, and the fear of the high priest being in such an agony.",
        "3:22": "They then called upon the Almighty Lord to keep the things committed of trust safe and sure for those that had committed them.",
        "3:23": "Nevertheless Heliodorus executed that which was decreed.",
        "3:24": "Now as he was there present himself with his guard about the treasury, the Lord of spirits, and the Prince of all power, caused a great apparition, so that all that presumed to come in with him were astonished at the power of God, and fainted, and were sore afraid.",
        "3:25": "For there appeared unto them an horse with a terrible rider upon him, and adorned with a very fair covering, and he ran fiercely, and smote at Heliodorus with his forefeet, and it seemed that he that sat upon the horse had complete harness of gold.",
        "3:26": "Moreover two other young men appeared before him, notable in strength, excellent in beauty, and comely in apparel, who stood by him on either side; and scourged him continually, and gave him many sore stripes.",
        "3:27": "And Heliodorus fell suddenly unto the ground, and was compassed with great darkness: but they that were with him took him up, and put him into a litter.",
        "3:28": "Thus him, that lately came with a great train and with all his guard into the said treasury, they carried out, being unable to help himself with his weapons: and manifestly they acknowledged the power of God.",
        "3:29": "For he by the hand of God was cast down, and lay speechless without all hope of life.",
        "3:30": "But they praised the Lord, that had miraculously honoured his own place: for the temple; which a little afore was full of fear and trouble, when the Almighty Lord appeared, was filled with joy and gladness.",
        "3:31": "Then straightways certain of Heliodorus’ friends prayed Onias, that he would call upon the most High to grant him his life, who lay ready to give up the ghost.",
        "3:32": "So the high priest, suspecting lest the king should misconceive that some treachery had been done to Heliodorus by the Jews, offered a sacrifice for the health of the man.",
        "3:33": "Now as the high priest was making an atonement, the same young men in the same clothing appeared and stood beside Heliodorus, saying, Give Onias the high priest great thanks, insomuch as for his sake the Lord hath granted thee life:",
        "3:34": "And seeing that thou hast been scourged from heaven, declare unto all men the mighty power of God. And when they had spoken these words, they appeared no more.",
        "3:35": "So Heliodorus, after he had offered sacrifice unto the Lord, and made great vows unto him that had saved his life, and saluted Onias, returned with his host to the king.",
        "3:36": "Then testified he to all men the works of the great God, which he had seen with his eyes.",
        "3:37": "And when the king Heliodorus, who might be a fit man to be sent yet once again to Jerusalem, he said,",
        "3:38": "If thou hast any enemy or traitor, send him thither, and thou shalt receive him well scourged, if he escape with his life: for in that place, no doubt; there is an especial power of God.",
        "3:39": "For he that dwelleth in heaven hath his eye on that place, and defendeth it; and he beateth and destroyeth them that come to hurt it.",
        "3:40": "And the things concerning Heliodorus, and the keeping of the treasury, fell out on this sort.",
        "4:1": "This Simon now, of whom we spake afore, having been a betrayer of the money, and of his country, slandered Onias, as if he ha terrified Heliodorus, and been the worker of these evils.",
        "4:2": "Thus was he bold to call him a traitor, that had deserved well of the city, and tendered his own nation, and was so zealous of the laws.",
        "4:3": "But when their hatred went so far, that by one of Simon’s faction murders were committed,",
        "4:4": "Onias seeing the danger of this contention, and that Apollonius, as being the governor of Celosyria and Phenice, did rage, and increase Simon’s malice,",
        "4:5": "He went to the king, not to be an accuser of his countrymen, but seeking the good of all, both publick and private:",
        "4:6": "For he saw that it was impossible that the state should continue quiet, and Simon leave his folly, unless the king did look thereunto.",
        "4:7": "But after the death of Seleucus, when Antiochus, called Epiphanes, took the kingdom, Jason the brother of Onias laboured underhand to be high priest,",
        "4:8": "Promising unto the king by intercession three hundred and threescore talents of silver, and of another revenue eighty talents:",
        "4:9": "Beside this, he promised to assign an hundred and fifty more, if he might have licence to set him up a place for exercise, and for the training up of youth in the fashions of the heathen, and to write them of Jerusalem by the name of Antiochians.",
        "4:10": "Which when the king had granted, and he had gotten into his hand the rule he forthwith brought his own nation to Greekish fashion.",
        "4:11": "And the royal privileges granted of special favour to the Jews by the means of John the father of Eupolemus, who went ambassador to Rome for amity and aid, he took away; and putting down the governments which were according to the law, he brought up new customs against the law:",
        "4:12": "For he built gladly a place of exercise under the tower itself, and brought the chief young men under his subjection, and made them wear a hat.",
        "4:13": "Now such was the height of Greek fashions, and increase of heathenish manners, through the exceeding profaneness of Jason, that ungodly wretch, and no high priest;",
        "4:14": "That the priests had no courage to serve any more at the altar, but despising the temple, and neglecting the sacrifices, hastened to be partakers of the unlawful allowance in the place of exercise, after the game of Discus called them forth;",
        "4:15": "Not setting by the honours of their fathers, but liking the glory of the Grecians best of all.",
        "4:16": "By reason whereof sore calamity came upon them: for they had them to be their enemies and avengers, whose custom they followed so earnestly, and unto whom they desired to be like in all things.",
        "4:17": "For it is not a light thing to do wickedly against the laws of God: but the time following shall declare these things.",
        "4:18": "Now when the game that was used every faith year was kept at Tyrus, the king being present,",
        "4:19": "This ungracious Jason sent special messengers from Jerusalem, who were Antiochians, to carry three hundred drachms of silver to the sacrifice of Hercules, which even the bearers thereof thought fit not to bestow upon the sacrifice, because it was not convenient, but to be reserved for other charges.",
        "4:20": "This money then, in regard of the sender, was appointed to Hercules’ sacrifice; but because of the bearers thereof, it was employed to the making of gallies.",
        "4:21": "Now when Apollonius the son of Menestheus was sent into Egypt for the coronation of king Ptolemeus Philometor, Antiochus, understanding him not to be well affected to his affairs, provided for his own safety: whereupon he came to Joppa, and from thence to Jerusalem:",
        "4:22": "Where he was honourably received of Jason, and of the city, and was brought in with torch alight, and with great shoutings: and so afterward went with his host unto Phenice.",
        "4:23": "Three years afterward Jason sent Menelaus, the aforesaid Simon’s brother, to bear the money unto the king, and to put him in mind of certain necessary matters.",
        "4:24": "But he being brought to the presence of the king, when he had magnified him for the glorious appearance of his power, got the priesthood to himself, offering more than Jason by three hundred talents of silver.",
        "4:25": "So he came with the king’s mandate, bringing nothing worthy the high priesthood, but having the fury of a cruel tyrant, and the rage of a savage beast.",
        "4:26": "Then Jason, who had undermined his own brother, being undermined by another, was compelled to flee into the country of the Ammonites.",
        "4:27": "So Menelaus got the principality: but as for the money that he had promised unto the king, he took no good order for it, albeit Sostratis the ruler of the castle required it:",
        "4:28": "For unto him appertained the gathering of the customs. Wherefore they were both called before the king.",
        "4:29": "Now Menelaus left his brother Lysimachus in his stead in the priesthood; and Sostratus left Crates, who was governor of the Cyprians.",
        "4:30": "While those things were in doing, they of Tarsus and Mallos made insurrection, because they were given to the king’s concubine, called Antiochus.",
        "4:31": "Then came the king in all haste to appease matters, leaving Andronicus, a man in authority, for his deputy.",
        "4:32": "Now Menelaus, supposing that he had gotten a convenient time, stole certain vessels of gold out of the temple, and gave some of them to Andronicus, and some he sold into Tyrus and the cities round about.",
        "4:33": "Which when Onias knew of a surety, he reproved him, and withdrew himself into a sanctuary at Daphne, that lieth by Antiochia.",
        "4:34": "Wherefore Menelaus, taking Andronicus apart, prayed, him to get Onias into his hands; who being persuaded thereunto, and coming to Onias in deceit, gave him his right hand with oaths; and though he were suspected by him, yet persuaded he him to come forth of the sanctuary: whom forthwith he shut up without regard of justice.",
        "4:35": "For the which cause not only the Jews, but many also of other nations, took great indignation, and were much grieved for the unjust murder of the man.",
        "4:36": "And when the king was come again from the places about Cilicia, the Jews that were in the city, and certain of the Greeks that abhorred the fact also, complained because Onias was slain without cause.",
        "4:37": "Therefore Antiochus was heartily sorry, and moved to pity, and wept, because of the sober and modest behaviour of him that was dead.",
        "4:38": "And being kindled with anger, forthwith he took away Andronicus his purple, and rent off his clothes, and leading him through the whole city unto that very place, where he had committed impiety against Onias, there slew he the cursed murderer. Thus the Lord rewarded him his punishment, as he had deserved.",
        "4:39": "Now when many sacrileges had been committed in the city by Lysimachus with the consent of Menelaus, and the fruit thereof was spread abroad, the multitude gathered themselves together against Lysimachus, many vessels of gold being already carried away.",
        "4:40": "Whereupon the common people rising, and being filled with rage, Lysimachus armed about three thousand men, and began first to offer violence; one Auranus being the leader, a man far gone in years, and no less in folly.",
        "4:41": "They then seeing the attempt of Lysimachus, some of them caught stones, some clubs, others taking handfuls of dust, that was next at hand, cast them all together upon Lysimachus, and those that set upon them.",
        "4:42": "Thus many of them they wounded, and some they struck to the ground, and all of them they forced to flee: but as for the churchrobber himself, him they killed beside the treasury.",
        "4:43": "Of these matters therefore there was an accusation laid against Menelaus.",
        "4:44": "Now when the king came to Tyrus, three men that were sent from the senate pleaded the cause before him:",
        "4:45": "But Menelaus, being now convicted, promised Ptolemee the son of Dorymenes to give him much money, if he would pacify the king toward him.",
        "4:46": "Whereupon Ptolemee taking the king aside into a certain gallery, as it were to take the air, brought him to be of another mind:",
        "4:47": "Insomuch that he discharged Menelaus from the accusations, who notwithstanding was cause of all the mischief: and those poor men, who, if they had told their cause, yea, before the Scythians, should have been judged innocent, them he condemned to death.",
        "4:48": "Thus they that followed the matter for the city, and for the people, and for the holy vessels, did soon suffer unjust punishment.",
        "4:49": "Wherefore even they of Tyrus, moved with hatred of that wicked deed, caused them to be honourably buried.",
        "4:50": "And so through the covetousness of them that were of power Menelaus remained still in authority, increasing in malice, and being a great traitor to the citizens.",
        "5:1": "About the same time Antiochus prepared his second voyage into Egypt:",
        "5:2": "And then it happened, that through all the city, for the space almost of forty days, there were seen horsemen running in the air, in cloth of gold, and armed with lances, like a band of soldiers,",
        "5:3": "And troops of horsemen in array, encountering and running one against another, with shaking of shields, and multitude of pikes, and drawing of swords, and casting of darts, and glittering of golden ornaments, and harness of all sorts.",
        "5:4": "Wherefore every man prayed that that apparition might turn to good.",
        "5:5": "Now when there was gone forth a false rumour, as though Antiochus had been dead, Jason took at the least a thousand men, and suddenly made an assault upon the city; and they that were upon the walls being put back, and the city at length taken, Menelaus fled into the castle:",
        "5:6": "But Jason slew his own citizens without mercy, not considering that to get the day of them of his own nation would be a most unhappy day for him; but thinking they had been his enemies, and not his countrymen, whom he conquered.",
        "5:7": "Howbeit for all this he obtained not the principality, but at the last received shame for the reward of his treason, and fled again into the country of the Ammonites.",
        "5:8": "In the end therefore he had an unhappy return, being accused before Aretas the king of the Arabians, fleeing from city to city, pursued of all men, hated as a forsaker of the laws, and being had in abomination as an open enemy of his country and countrymen, he was cast out into Egypt.",
        "5:9": "Thus he that had driven many out of their country perished in a strange land, retiring to the Lacedemonians, and thinking there to find succour by reason of his kindred:",
        "5:10": "And he that had cast out many unburied had none to mourn for him, nor any solemn funerals at all, nor sepulchre with his fathers.",
        "5:11": "Now when this that was done came to the king’s car, he thought that Judea had revolted: whereupon removing out of Egypt in a furious mind, he took the city by force of arms,",
        "5:12": "And commanded his men of war not to spare such as they met, and to slay such as went up upon the houses.",
        "5:13": "Thus there was killing of young and old, making away of men, women, and children, slaying of virgins and infants.",
        "5:14": "And there were destroyed within the space of three whole days fourscore thousand, whereof forty thousand were slain in the conflict; and no fewer sold than slain.",
        "5:15": "Yet was he not content with this, but presumed to go into the most holy temple of all the world; Menelaus, that traitor to the laws, and to his own country, being his guide:",
        "5:16": "And taking the holy vessels with polluted hands, and with profane hands pulling down the things that were dedicated by other kings to the augmentation and glory and honour of the place, he gave them away.",
        "5:17": "And so haughty was Antiochus in mind, that he considered not that the Lord was angry for a while for the sins of them that dwelt in the city, and therefore his eye was not upon the place.",
        "5:18": "For had they not been formerly wrapped in many sins, this man, as soon as he had come, had forthwith been scourged, and put back from his presumption, as Heliodorus was, whom Seleucus the king sent to view the treasury.",
        "5:19": "Nevertheless God did not choose the people for the place’s sake, but the place far the people’s sake.",
        "5:20": "And therefore the place itself, that was partaker with them of the adversity that happened to the nation, did afterward communicate in the benefits sent from the Lord: and as it was forsaken in the wrath of the Almighty, so again, the great Lord being reconciled, it was set up with all glory.",
        "5:21": "So when Antiochus had carried out of the temple a thousand and eight hundred talents, he departed in all haste unto Antiochia, weening in his pride to make the land navigable, and the sea passable by foot: such was the haughtiness of his mind.",
        "5:22": "And he left governors to vex the nation: at Jerusalem, Philip, for his country a Phrygian, and for manners more barbarous than he that set him there;",
        "5:23": "And at Garizim, Andronicus; and besides, Menelaus, who worse than all the rest bare an heavy hand over the citizens, having a malicious mind against his countrymen the Jews.",
        "5:24": "He sent also that detestable ringleader Apollonius with an army of two and twenty thousand, commanding him to slay all those that were in their best age, and to sell the women and the younger sort:",
        "5:25": "Who coming to Jerusalem, and pretending peace, did forbear till the holy day of the sabbath, when taking the Jews keeping holy day, he commanded his men to arm themselves.",
        "5:26": "And so he slew all them that were gone to the celebrating of the sabbath, and running through the city with weapons slew great multitudes.",
        "5:27": "But Judas Maccabeus with nine others, or thereabout, withdrew himself into the wilderness, and lived in the mountains after the manner of beasts, with his company, who fed on herbs continually, lest they should be partakers of the pollution.",
        "6:1": "Not long after this the king sent an old man of Athens to compel the Jews to depart from the laws of their fathers, and not to live after the laws of God:",
        "6:2": "And to pollute also the temple in Jerusalem, and to call it the temple of Jupiter Olympius; and that in Garizim, of Jupiter the Defender of strangers, as they did desire that dwelt in the place.",
        "6:3": "The coming in of this mischief was sore and grievous to the people:",
        "6:4": "For the temple was filled with riot and revelling by the Gentiles, who dallied with harlots, and had to do with women within the circuit of the holy places, and besides that brought in things that were not lawful.",
        "6:5": "The altar also was filled with profane things, which the law forbiddeth.",
        "6:6": "Neither was it lawful for a man to keep sabbath days or ancient fasts, or to profess himself at all to be a Jew.",
        "6:7": "And in the day of the king’s birth every month they were brought by bitter constraint to eat of the sacrifices; and when the fast of Bacchus was kept, the Jews were compelled to go in procession to Bacchus, carrying ivy.",
        "6:8": "Moreover there went out a decree to the neighbour cities of the heathen, by the suggestion of Ptolemee, against the Jews, that they should observe the same fashions, and be partakers of their sacrifices:",
        "6:9": "And whoso would not conform themselves to the manners of the Gentiles should be put to death. Then might a man have seen the present misery.",
        "6:10": "For there were two women brought, who had circumcised their children; whom when they had openly led round about the city, the babes handing at their breasts, they cast them down headlong from the wall.",
        "6:11": "And others, that had run together into caves near by, to keep the sabbath day secretly, being discovered by Philip, were all burnt together, because they made a conscience to help themselves for the honour of the most sacred day.",
        "6:12": "Now I beseech those that read this book, that they be not discouraged for these calamities, but that they judge those punishments not to be for destruction, but for a chastening of our nation.",
        "6:13": "For it is a token of his great goodness, when wicked doers are not suffered any long time, but forthwith punished.",
        "6:14": "For not as with other nations, whom the Lord patiently forbeareth to punish, till they be come to the fulness of their sins, so dealeth he with us,",
        "6:15": "Lest that, being come to the height of sin, afterwards he should take vengeance of us.",
        "6:16": "And therefore he never withdraweth his mercy from us: and though he punish with adversity, yet doth he never forsake his people.",
        "6:17": "But let this that we at spoken be for a warning unto us. And now will we come to the declaring of the matter in a few words.",
        "6:18": "Eleazar, one of the principal scribes, an aged man, and of a well favoured countenance, was constrained to open his mouth, and to eat swine’s flesh.",
        "6:19": "But he, choosing rather to die gloriously, than to live stained with such an abomination, spit it forth, and came of his own accord to the torment,",
        "6:20": "As it behoved them to come, that are resolute to stand out against such things, as are not lawful for love of life to be tasted.",
        "6:21": "But they that had the charge of that wicked feast, for the old acquaintance they had with the man, taking him aside, besought him to bring flesh of his own provision, such as was lawful for him to use, and make as if he did eat of the flesh taken from the sacrifice commanded by the king;",
        "6:22": "That in so doing he might be delivered from death, and for the old friendship with them find favour.",
        "6:23": "But he began to consider discreetly, and as became his age, and the excellency of his ancient years, and the honour of his gray head, whereon was come, and his most honest education from a child, or rather the holy law made and given by God: therefore he answered accordingly, and willed them straightways to send him to the grave.",
        "6:24": "For it becometh not our age, said he, in any wise to dissemble, whereby many young persons might think that Eleazar, being fourscore years old and ten, were now gone to a strange religion;",
        "6:25": "And so they through mine hypocrisy, and desire to live a little time and a moment longer, should be deceived by me, and I get a stain to mine old age, and make it abominable.",
        "6:26": "For though for the present time I should be delivered from the punishment of men: yet should I not escape the hand of the Almighty, neither alive, nor dead.",
        "6:27": "Wherefore now, manfully changing this life, I will shew myself such an one as mine age requireth,",
        "6:28": "And leave a notable example to such as be young to die willingly and courageously for the honourable and holy laws. And when he had said these words, immediately he went to the torment:",
        "6:29": "They that led him changing the good will they bare him a little before into hatred, because the foresaid speeches proceeded, as they thought, from a desperate mind.",
        "6:30": "But when he was ready to die with stripes, he groaned, and said, It is manifest unto the Lord, that hath the holy knowledge, that whereas I might have been delivered from death, I now endure sore pains in body by being beaten: but in soul am well content to suffer these things, because I fear him.",
        "6:31": "And thus this man died, leaving his death for an example of a noble courage, and a memorial of virtue, not only unto young men, but unto all his nation.",
        "7:1": "It came to pass also, that seven brethren with their mother were taken, and compelled by the king against the law to taste swine’s flesh, and were tormented with scourges and whips.",
        "7:2": "But one of them that spake first said thus, What wouldest thou ask or learn of us? we are ready to die, rather than to transgress the laws of our fathers.",
        "7:3": "Then the king, being in a rage, commanded pans and caldrons to be made hot:",
        "7:4": "Which forthwith being heated, he commanded to cut out the tongue of him that spake first, and to cut off the utmost parts of his body, the rest of his brethren and his mother looking on.",
        "7:5": "Now when he was thus maimed in all his members, he commanded him being yet alive to be brought to the fire, and to be fried in the pan: and as the vapour of the pan was for a good space dispersed, they exhorted one another with the mother to die manfully, saying thus,",
        "7:6": "The Lord God looketh upon us, and in truth hath comfort in us, as Moses in his song, which witnessed to their faces, declared, saying, And he shall be comforted in his servants.",
        "7:7": "So when the first was dead after this number, they brought the second to make him a mocking stock: and when they had pulled off the skin of his head with the hair, they asked him, Wilt thou eat, before thou be punished throughout every member of thy body?",
        "7:8": "But he answered in his own language, and said, No. Wherefore he also received the next torment in order, as the former did.",
        "7:9": "And when he was at the last gasp, he said, Thou like a fury takest us out of this present life, but the King of the world shall raise us up, who have died for his laws, unto everlasting life.",
        "7:10": "After him was the third made a mocking stock: and when he was required, he put out his tongue, and that right soon, holding forth his hands manfully.",
        "7:11": "And said courageously, These I had from heaven; and for his laws I despise them; and from him I hope to receive them again.",
        "7:12": "Insomuch that the king, and they that were with him, marvelled at the young man’s courage, for that he nothing regarded the pains.",
        "7:13": "Now when this man was dead also, they tormented and mangled the fourth in like manner.",
        "7:14": "So when he was ready to die he said thus, It is good, being put to death by men, to look for hope from God to be raised up again by him: as for thee, thou shalt have no resurrection to life.",
        "7:15": "Afterward they brought the fifth also, and mangled him.",
        "7:16": "Then looked he unto the king, and said, Thou hast power over men, thou art corruptible, thou doest what thou wilt; yet think not that our nation is forsaken of God;",
        "7:17": "But abide a while, and behold his great power, how he will torment thee and thy seed.",
        "7:18": "After him also they brought the sixth, who being ready to die said, Be not deceived without cause: for we suffer these things for ourselves, having sinned against our God: therefore marvellous things are done unto us.",
        "7:19": "But think not thou, that takest in hand to strive against God, that thou shalt escape unpunished.",
        "7:20": "But the mother was marvellous above all, and worthy of honourable memory: for when she saw her seven sons slain within the space of one day, she bare it with a good courage, because of the hope that she had in the Lord.",
        "7:21": "Yea, she exhorted every one of them in her own language, filled with courageous spirits; and stirring up her womanish thoughts with a manly stomach, she said unto them,",
        "7:22": "I cannot tell how ye came into my womb: for I neither gave you breath nor life, neither was it I that formed the members of every one of you;",
        "7:23": "But doubtless the Creator of the world, who formed the generation of man, and found out the beginning of all things, will also of his own mercy give you breath and life again, as ye now regard not your own selves for his laws’ sake.",
        "7:24": "Now Antiochus, thinking himself despised, and suspecting it to be a reproachful speech, whilst the youngest was yet alive, did not only exhort him by words, but also assured him with oaths, that he would make him both a rich and a happy man, if he would turn from the laws of his fathers; and that also he would take him for his friend, and trust him with affairs.",
        "7:25": "But when the young man would in no case hearken unto him, the king called his mother, and exhorted her that she would counsel the young man to save his life.",
        "7:26": "And when he had exhorted her with many words, she promised him that she would counsel her son.",
        "7:27": "But she bowing herself toward him, laughing the cruel tyrant to scorn, spake in her country language on this manner; O my son, have pity upon me that bare thee nine months in my womb, and gave thee such three years, and nourished thee, and brought thee up unto this age, and endured the troubles of education.",
        "7:28": "I beseech thee, my son, look upon the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, and consider that God made them of things that were not; and so was mankind made likewise.",
        "7:29": "Fear not this tormentor, but, being worthy of thy brethren, take thy death that I may receive thee again in mercy with thy brethren.",
        "7:30": "Whiles she was yet speaking these words, the young man said, Whom wait ye for? I will not obey the king’s commandment: but I will obey the commandment of the law that was given unto our fathers by Moses.",
        "7:31": "And thou, that hast been the author of all mischief against the Hebrews, shalt not escape the hands of God.",
        "7:32": "For we suffer because of our sins.",
        "7:33": "And though the living Lord be angry with us a little while for our chastening and correction, yet shall he be at one again with his servants.",
        "7:34": "But thou, O godless man, and of all other most wicked, be not lifted up without a cause, nor puffed up with uncertain hopes, lifting up thy hand against the servants of God:",
        "7:35": "For thou hast not yet escaped the judgment of Almighty God, who seeth all things.",
        "7:36": "For our brethren, who now have suffered a short pain, are dead under God’s covenant of everlasting life: but thou, through the judgment of God, shalt receive just punishment for thy pride.",
        "7:37": "But I, as my brethren, offer up my body and life for the laws of our fathers, beseeching God that he would speedily be merciful unto our nation; and that thou by torments and plagues mayest confess, that he alone is God;",
        "7:38": "And that in me and my brethren the wrath of the Almighty, which is justly brought upon our nation, may cease.",
        "7:39": "Than the king’ being in a rage, handed him worse than all the rest, and took it grievously that he was mocked.",
        "7:40": "So this man died undefiled, and put his whole trust in the Lord.",
        "7:41": "Last of all after the sons the mother died.",
        "7:42": "Let this be enough now to have spoken concerning the idolatrous feasts, and the extreme tortures.",
        "8:1": "Then Judas Maccabeus, and they that were with him, went privily into the towns, and called their kinsfolks together, and took unto them all such as continued in the Jews’ religion, and assembled about six thousand men.",
        "8:2": "And they called upon the Lord, that he would look upon the people that was trodden down of all; and also pity the temple profaned of ungodly men;",
        "8:3": "And that he would have compassion upon the city, sore defaced, and ready to be made even with the ground; and hear the blood that cried unto him,",
        "8:4": "And remember the wicked slaughter of harmless infants, and the blasphemies committed against his name; and that he would shew his hatred against the wicked.",
        "8:5": "Now when Maccabeus had his company about him, he could not be withstood by the heathen: for the wrath of the Lord was turned into mercy.",
        "8:6": "Therefore he came at unawares, and burnt up towns and cities, and got into his hands the most commodious places, and overcame and put to flight no small number of his enemies.",
        "8:7": "But specially took he advantage of the night for such privy attempts, insomuch that the fruit of his holiness was spread every where.",
        "8:8": "So when Philip saw that this man increased by little and little, and that things prospered with him still more and more, he wrote unto Ptolemeus, the governor of Celosyria and Phenice, to yield more aid to the king’s affairs.",
        "8:9": "Then forthwith choosing Nicanor the son of Patroclus, one of his special friends, he sent him with no fewer than twenty thousand of all nations under him, to root out the whole generation of the Jews; and with him he joined also Gorgias a captain, who in matters of war had great experience.",
        "8:10": "So Nicanor undertook to make so much money of the captive Jews, as should defray the tribute of two thousand talents, which the king was to pay to the Romans.",
        "8:11": "Wherefore immediately he sent to the cities upon the sea coast, proclaiming a sale of the captive Jews, and promising that they should have fourscore and ten bodies for one talent, not expecting the vengeance that was to follow upon him from the Almighty God.",
        "8:12": "Now when word was brought unto Judas of Nicanor’s coming, and he had imparted unto those that were with him that the army was at hand,",
        "8:13": "They that were fearful, and distrusted the justice of God, fled, and conveyed themselves away.",
        "8:14": "Others sold all that they had left, and withal besought the Lord to deliver them, sold by the wicked Nicanor before they met together:",
        "8:15": "And if not for their own sakes, yet for the covenants he had made with their fathers, and for his holy and glorious name’s sake, by which they were called.",
        "8:16": "So Maccabeus called his men together unto the number of six thousand, and exhorted them not to be stricken with terror of the enemy, nor to fear the great multitude of the heathen, who came wrongly against them; but to fight manfully,",
        "8:17": "And to set before their eyes the injury that they had unjustly done to the holy place, and the cruel handling of the city, whereof they made a mockery, and also the taking away of the government of their forefathers:",
        "8:18": "For they, said he, trust in their weapons and boldness; but our confidence is in the Almighty who at a beck can cast down both them that come against us, and also all the world.",
        "8:19": "Moreover, he recounted unto them what helps their forefathers had found, and how they were delivered, when under Sennacherib an hundred fourscore and five thousand perished.",
        "8:20": "And he told them of the battle that they had in Babylon with the Galatians, how they came but eight thousand in all to the business, with four thousand Macedonians, and that the Macedonians being perplexed, the eight thousand destroyed an hundred and twenty thousand because of the help that they had from heaven, and so received a great booty.",
        "8:21": "Thus when he had made them bold with these words, and ready to die for the law and the country, he divided his army into four parts;",
        "8:22": "And joined with himself his own brethren, leaders of each band, to wit Simon, and Joseph, and Jonathan, giving each one fifteen hundred men.",
        "8:23": "Also he appointed Eleazar to read the holy book: and when he had given them this watchword, The help of God; himself leading the first band,",
        "8:24": "And by the help of the Almighty they slew above nine thousand of their enemies, and wounded and maimed the most part of Nicanor’s host, and so put all to flight;",
        "8:25": "And took their money that came to buy them, and pursued them far: but lacking time they returned:",
        "8:26": "For it was the day before the sabbath, and therefore they would no longer pursue them.",
        "8:27": "So when they had gathered their armour together, and spoiled their enemies, they occupied themselves about the sabbath, yielding exceeding praise and thanks to the Lord, who had preserved them unto that day, which was the beginning of mercy distilling upon them.",
        "8:28": "And after the sabbath, when they had given part of the spoils to the maimed, and the widows, and orphans, the residue they divided among themselves and their servants.",
        "8:29": "When this was done, and they had made a common supplication, they besought the merciful Lord to be reconciled with his servants for ever.",
        "8:30": "Moreover of those that were with Timotheus and Bacchides, who fought against them, they slew above twenty thousand, and very easily got high and strong holds, and divided among themselves many spoils more, and made the maimed, orphans, widows, yea, and the aged also, equal in spoils with themselves.",
        "8:31": "And when they had gathered their armour together, they laid them up all carefully in convenient places, and the remnant of the spoils they brought to Jerusalem.",
        "8:32": "They slew also Philarches, that wicked person, who was with Timotheus, and had annoyed the Jews many ways.",
        "8:33": "Furthermore at such time as they kept the feast for the victory in their country they burnt Callisthenes, that had set fire upon the holy gates, who had fled into a little house; and so he received a reward meet for his wickedness.",
        "8:34": "As for that most ungracious Nicanor, who had brought a thousand merchants to buy the Jews,",
        "8:35": "He was through the help of the Lord brought down by them, of whom he made least account; and putting off his glorious apparel, and discharging his company, he came like a fugitive servant through the midland unto Antioch having very great dishonour, for that his host was destroyed.",
        "8:36": "Thus he, that took upon him to make good to the Romans their tribute by means of captives in Jerusalem, told abroad, that the Jews had God to fight for them, and therefore they could not be hurt, because they followed the laws that he gave them.",
        "9:1": "About that time came Antiochus with dishonour out of the country of Persia",
        "9:2": "For he had entered the city called Persepolis, and went about to rob the temple, and to hold the city; whereupon the multitude running to defend themselves with their weapons put them to flight; and so it happened, that Antiochus being put to flight of the inhabitants returned with shame.",
        "9:3": "Now when he came to Ecbatane, news was brought him what had happened unto Nicanor and Timotheus.",
        "9:4": "Then swelling with anger. he thought to avenge upon the Jews the disgrace done unto him by those that made him flee. Therefore commanded he his chariotman to drive without ceasing, and to dispatch the journey, the judgment of God now following him. For he had spoken proudly in this sort, That he would come to Jerusalem and make it a common burying place of the Jews.",
        "9:5": "But the Lord Almighty, the God of Isreal, smote him with an incurable and invisible plague: or as soon as he had spoken these words, a pain of the bowels that was remediless came upon him, and sore torments of the inner parts;",
        "9:6": "And that most justly: for he had tormented other men’s bowels with many and strange torments.",
        "9:7": "Howbeit he nothing at all ceased from his bragging, but still was filled with pride, breathing out fire in his rage against the Jews, and commanding to haste the journey: but it came to pass that he fell down from his chariot, carried violently; so that having a sore fall, all the members of his body were much pained.",
        "9:8": "And thus he that a little afore thought he might command the waves of the sea, (so proud was he beyond the condition of man) and weigh the high mountains in a balance, was now cast on the ground, and carried in an horselitter, shewing forth unto all the manifest power of God.",
        "9:9": "So that the worms rose up out of the body of this wicked man, and whiles he lived in sorrow and pain, his flesh fell away, and the filthiness of his smell was noisome to all his army.",
        "9:10": "And the man, that thought a little afore he could reach to the stars of heaven, no man could endure to carry for his intolerable stink.",
        "9:11": "Here therefore, being plagued, he began to leave off his great pride, and to come to the knowledge of himself by the scourge of God, his pain increasing every moment.",
        "9:12": "And when he himself could not abide his own smell, he said these words, It is meet to be subject unto God, and that a man that is mortal should not proudly think of himself if he were God.",
        "9:13": "This wicked person vowed also unto the Lord, who now no more would have mercy upon him, saying thus,",
        "9:14": "That the holy city (to the which he was going in haste to lay it even with the ground, and to make it a common buryingplace,) he would set at liberty:",
        "9:15": "And as touching the Jews, whom he had judged not worthy so much as to be buried, but to be cast out with their children to be devoured of the fowls and wild beasts, he would make them all equals to the citizens of Athens:",
        "9:16": "And the holy temple, which before he had spoiled, he would garnish with goodly gifts, and restore all the holy vessels with many more, and out of his own revenue defray the charges belonging to the sacrifices:",
        "9:17": "Yea, and that also he would become a Jew himself, and go through all the world that was inhabited, and declare the power of God.",
        "9:18": "But for all this his pains would not cease: for the just judgment of God was come upon him: therefore despairing of his health, he wrote unto the Jews the letter underwritten, containing the form of a supplication, after this manner:",
        "9:19": "Antiochus, king and governor, to the good Jews his citizens wisheth much joy, health, and prosperity:",
        "9:20": "If ye and your children fare well, and your affairs be to your contentment, I give very great thanks to God, having my hope in heaven.",
        "9:21": "As for me, I was weak, or else I would have remembered kindly your honour and good will returning out of Persia, and being taken with a grievous disease, I thought it necessary to care for the common safety of all:",
        "9:22": "Not distrusting mine health, but having great hope to escape this sickness.",
        "9:23": "But considering that even my father, at what time he led an army into the high countries. appointed a successor,",
        "9:24": "To the end that, if any thing fell out contrary to expectation, or if any tidings were brought that were grievous, they of the land, knowing to whom the state was left, might not be troubled:",
        "9:25": "Again, considering how that the princes that are borderers and neighbours unto my kingdom wait for opportunities, and expect what shall be the event. I have appointed my son Antiochus king, whom I often committed and commended unto many of you, when I went up into the high provinces; to whom I have written as followeth:",
        "9:26": "Therefore I pray and request you to remember the benefits that I have done unto you generally, and in special, and that every man will be still faithful to me and my son.",
        "9:27": "For I am persuaded that he understanding my mind will favourably and graciously yield to your desires.",
        "9:28": "Thus the murderer and blasphemer having suffered most grievously, as he entreated other men, so died he a miserable death in a strange country in the mountains.",
        "9:29": "And Philip, that was brought up with him, carried away his body, who also fearing the son of Antiochus went into Egypt to Ptolemeus Philometor.",
        "10:1": "Now Maccabeus and his company, the Lord guiding them, recovered the temple and the city:",
        "10:2": "But the altars which the heathen had built in the open street, and also the chapels, they pulled down.",
        "10:3": "And having cleansed the temple they made another altar, and striking stones they took fire out of them, and offered a sacrifice after two years, and set forth incense, and lights, and shewbread.",
        "10:4": "When that was done, they fell flat down, and besought the Lord that they might come no more into such troubles; but if they sinned any more against him, that he himself would chasten them with mercy, and that they might not be delivered unto the blasphemous and barbarous nations.",
        "10:5": "Now upon the same day that the strangers profaned the temple, on the very same day it was cleansed again, even the five and twentieth day of the same month, which is Casleu.",
        "10:6": "And they kept the eight days with gladness, as in the feast of the tabernacles, remembering that not long afore they had held the feast of the tabernacles, when as they wandered in the mountains and dens like beasts.",
        "10:7": "Therefore they bare branches, and fair boughs, and palms also, and sang psalms unto him that had given them good success in cleansing his place.",
        "10:8": "They ordained also by a common statute and decree, That every year those days should be kept of the whole nation of the Jews.",
        "10:9": "And this was the end of Antiochus, called Epiphanes.",
        "10:10": "Now will we declare the acts of Antiochus Eupator, who was the son of this wicked man, gathering briefly the calamities of the wars.",
        "10:11": "So when he was come to the crown, he set one Lysias over the affairs of his realm, and appointed him his chief governor of Celosyria and Phenice.",
        "10:12": "For Ptolemeus, that was called Macron, choosing rather to do justice unto the Jews for the wrong that had been done unto them, endeavoured to continue peace with them.",
        "10:13": "Whereupon being accused of the king’s friends before Eupator, and called traitor at every word because he had left Cyprus, that Philometor had committed unto him, and departed to Antiochus Epiphanes, and seeing that he was in no honourable place, he was so discouraged, that he poisoned himself and died.",
        "10:14": "But when Gorgias was governor of the holds, he hired soldiers, and nourished war continually with the Jews:",
        "10:15": "And therewithall the Idumeans, having gotten into their hands the most commodious holds, kept the Jews occupied, and receiving those that were banished from Jerusalem, they went about to nourish war.",
        "10:16": "Then they that were with Maccabeus made supplication, and besought God that he would be their helper; and so they ran with violence upon the strong holds of the Idumeans,",
        "10:17": "And assaulting them strongly, they won the holds, and kept off all that fought upon the wall, and slew all that fell into their hands, and killed no fewer than twenty thousand.",
        "10:18": "And because certain, who were no less than nine thousand, were fled together into two very strong castles, having all manner of things convenient to sustain the siege,",
        "10:19": "Maccabeus left Simon and Joseph, and Zaccheus also, and them that were with him, who were enough to besiege them, and departed himself unto those places which more needed his help.",
        "10:20": "Now they that were with Simon, being led with covetousness, were persuaded for money through certain of those that were in the castle, and took seventy thousand drachms, and let some of them escape.",
        "10:21": "But when it was told Maccabeus what was done, he called the governors of the people together, and accused those men, that they had sold their brethren for money, and set their enemies free to fight against them.",
        "10:22": "So he slew those that were found traitors, and immediately took the two castles.",
        "10:23": "And having good success with his weapons in all things he took in hand, he slew in the two holds more than twenty thousand.",
        "10:24": "Now Timotheus, whom the Jews had overcome before, when he had gathered a great multitude of foreign forces, and horses out of Asia not a few, came as though he would take Jewry by force of arms.",
        "10:25": "But when he drew near, they that were with Maccabeus turned themselves to pray unto God, and sprinkled earth upon their heads, and girded their loins with sackcloth,",
        "10:26": "And fell down at the foot of the altar, and besought him to be merciful to them, and to be an enemy to their enemies, and an adversary to their adversaries, as the law declareth.",
        "10:27": "So after the prayer they took their weapons, and went on further from the city: and when they drew near to their enemies, they kept by themselves.",
        "10:28": "Now the sun being newly risen, they joined both together; the one part having together with their virtue their refuge also unto the Lord for a pledge of their success and victory: the other side making their rage leader of their battle",
        "10:29": "But when the battle waxed strong, there appeared unto the enemies from heaven five comely men upon horses, with bridles of gold, and two of them led the Jews,",
        "10:30": "And took Maccabeus betwixt them, and covered him on every side weapons, and kept him safe, but shot arrows and lightnings against the enemies: so that being confounded with blindness, and full of trouble, they were killed.",
        "10:31": "And there were slain of footmen twenty thousand and five hundred, and six hundred horsemen.",
        "10:32": "As for Timotheus himself, he fled into a very strong hold, called Gawra, where Chereas was governor.",
        "10:33": "But they that were with Maccabeus laid siege against the fortress courageously four days.",
        "10:34": "And they that were within, trusting to the strength of the place, blasphemed exceedingly, and uttered wicked words.",
        "10:35": "Nevertheless upon the fifth day early twenty young men of Maccabeus’ company, inflamed with anger because of the blasphemies, assaulted the wall manly, and with a fierce courage killed all that they met withal.",
        "10:36": "Others likewise ascending after them, whiles they were busied with them that were within, burnt the towers, and kindling fires burnt the blasphemers alive; and others broke open the gates, and, having received in the rest of the army, took the city,",
        "10:37": "And killed Timotheus, that was hid in a certain pit, and Chereas his brother, with Apollophanes.",
        "10:38": "When this was done, they praised the Lord with psalms and thanksgiving, who had done so great things for Israel, and given them the victory.",
        "11:1": "Not long after the, Lysias the king’s protector and cousin, who also managed the affairs, took sore displeasure for the things that were done.",
        "11:2": "And when he had gathered about fourscore thousand with all the horsemen, he came against the Jews, thinking to make the city an habitation of the Gentiles,",
        "11:3": "And to make a gain of the temple, as of the other chapels of the heathen, and to set the high priesthood to sale every year:",
        "11:4": "Not at all considering the power of God but puffed up with his ten thousands of footmen, and his thousands of horsemen, and his fourscore elephants.",
        "11:5": "So he came to Judea, and drew near to Bethsura, which was a strong town, but distant from Jerusalem about five furlongs, and he laid sore siege unto it.",
        "11:6": "Now when they that were with Maccabeus heard that he besieged the holds, they and all the people with lamentation and tears besought the Lord that he would send a good angel to deliver Israel.",
        "11:7": "Then Maccabeus himself first of all took weapons, exhorting the other that they would jeopard themselves together with him to help their brethren: so they went forth together with a willing mind.",
        "11:8": "And as they were at Jerusalem, there appeared before them on horseback one in white clothing, shaking his armour of gold.",
        "11:9": "Then they praised the merciful God all together, and took heart, insomuch that they were ready not only to fight with men, but with most cruel beasts, and to pierce through walls of iron.",
        "11:10": "Thus they marched forward in their armour, having an helper from heaven: for the Lord was merciful unto them",
        "11:11": "And giving a charge upon their enemies like lions, they slew eleven thousand footmen, and sixteen hundred horsemen, and put all the other to flight.",
        "11:12": "Many of them also being wounded escaped naked; and Lysias himself fled away shamefully, and so escaped.",
        "11:13": "Who, as he was a man of understanding, casting with himself what loss he had had, and considering that the Hebrews could not be overcome, because the Almighty God helped them, he sent unto them,",
        "11:14": "And persuaded them to agree to all reasonable conditions, and promised that he would persuade the king that he must needs be a friend unto them.",
        "11:15": "Then Maccabeus consented to all that Lysias desired, being careful of the common good; and whatsoever Maccabeus wrote unto Lysias concerning the Jews, the king granted it.",
        "11:16": "For there were letters written unto the Jews from Lysias to this effect: Lysias unto the people of the Jews sendeth greeting:",
        "11:17": "John and Absolom, who were sent from you, delivered me the petition subscribed, and made request for the performance of the contents thereof.",
        "11:18": "Therefore what things soever were meet to be reported to the king, I have declared them, and he hath granted as much as might be.",
        "11:19": "And if then ye will keep yourselves loyal to the state, hereafter also will I endeavour to be a means of your good.",
        "11:20": "But of the particulars I have given order both to these and the other that came from me, to commune with you.",
        "11:21": "Fare ye well. The hundred and eight and fortieth year, the four and twentieth day of the month Dioscorinthius.",
        "11:22": "Now the king’s letter contained these words: King Antiochus unto his brother Lysias sendeth greeting:",
        "11:23": "Since our father is translated unto the gods, our will is, that they that are in our realm live quietly, that every one may attend upon his own affairs.",
        "11:24": "We understand also that the Jews would not consent to our father, for to be brought unto the custom of the Gentiles, but had rather keep their own manner of living: for the which cause they require of us, that we should suffer them to live after their own laws.",
        "11:25": "Wherefore our mind is, that this nation shall be in rest, and we have determined to restore them their temple, that they may live according to the customs of their forefathers.",
        "11:26": "Thou shalt do well therefore to send unto them, and grant them peace, that when they are certified of our mind, they may be of good comfort, and ever go cheerfully about their own affairs.",
        "11:27": "And the letter of the king unto the nation of the Jews was after this manner: King Antiochus sendeth greeting unto the council, and the rest of the Jews:",
        "11:28": "If ye fare well, we have our desire; we are also in good health.",
        "11:29": "Menelaus declared unto us, that your desire was to return home, and to follow your own business:",
        "11:30": "Wherefore they that will depart shall have safe conduct till the thirtieth day of Xanthicus with security.",
        "11:31": "And the Jews shall use their own kind of meats and laws, as before; and none of them any manner of ways shall be molested for things ignorantly done.",
        "11:32": "I have sent also Menelaus, that he may comfort you.",
        "11:33": "Fare ye well. In the hundred forty and eighth year, and the fifteenth day of the month Xanthicus.",
        "11:34": "The Romans also sent unto them a letter containing these words: Quintus Memmius and Titus Manlius, ambassadors of the Romans, send greeting unto the people of the Jews.",
        "11:35": "Whatsoever Lysias the king’s cousin hath granted, therewith we also are well pleased.",
        "11:36": "But touching such things as he judged to be referred to the king, after ye have advised thereof, send one forthwith, that we may declare as it is convenient for you: for we are now going to Antioch.",
        "11:37": "Therefore send some with speed, that we may know what is your mind.",
        "11:38": "Farewell. This hundred and eight and fortieth year, the fifteenth day of the month Xanthicus.",
        "12:1": "When these covenants were made, Lysias went unto the king, and the Jews were about their husbandry.",
        "12:2": "But of the governours of several places, Timotheus, and Apollonius the son of Genneus, also Hieronymus, and Demophon, and beside them Nicanor the governor of Cyprus, would not suffer them to be quiet and live in peace.",
        "12:3": "The men of Joppa also did such an ungodly deed: they prayed the Jews that dwelt among them to go with their wives and children into the boats which they had prepared, as though they had meant them no hurt.",
        "12:4": "Who accepted of it according to the common decree of the city, as being desirous to live in peace, and suspecting nothing: but when they were gone forth into the deep, they drowned no less than two hundred of them.",
        "12:5": "When Judas heard of this cruelty done unto his countrymen, he commanded those that were with him to make them ready.",
        "12:6": "And calling upon God the righteous Judge, he came against those murderers of his brethren, and burnt the haven by night, and set the boats on fire, and those that fled thither he slew.",
        "12:7": "And when the town was shut up, he went backward, as if he would return to root out all them of the city of Joppa.",
        "12:8": "But when he heard that the Jamnites were minded to do in like manner unto the Jews that dwelt among them,",
        "12:9": "He came upon the Jamnites also by night, and set fire on the haven and the navy, so that the light of the fire was seen at Jerusalem two hundred and forty furlongs off.",
        "12:10": "Now when they were gone from thence nine furlongs in their journey toward Timotheus, no fewer than five thousand men on foot and five hundred horsemen of the Arabians set upon him.",
        "12:11": "Whereupon there was a very sore battle; but Judas’ side by the help of God got the victory; so that the Nomades of Arabia, being overcome, besought Judas for peace, promising both to give him cattle, and to pleasure him otherwise.",
        "12:12": "Then Judas, thinking indeed that they would be profitable in many things, granted them peace: whereupon they shook hands, and so they departed to their tents.",
        "12:13": "He went also about to make a bridge to a certain strong city, which was fenced about with walls, and inhabited by people of divers countries; and the name of it was Caspis.",
        "12:14": "But they that were within it put such trust in the strength of the walls and provision of victuals, that they behaved themselves rudely toward them that were with Judas, railing and blaspheming, and uttering such words as were not to be spoken.",
        "12:15": "Wherefore Judas with his company, calling upon the great Lord of the world, who without rams or engines of war did cast down Jericho in the time of Joshua, gave a fierce assault against the walls,",
        "12:16": "And took the city by the will of God, and made unspeakable slaughters, insomuch that a lake two furlongs broad near adjoining thereunto, being filled full, was seen running with blood.",
        "12:17": "Then departed they from thence seven hundred and fifty furlongs, and came to Characa unto the Jews that are called Tubieni.",
        "12:18": "But as for Timotheus, they found him not in the places: for before he had dispatched any thing, he departed from thence, having left a very strong garrison in a certain hold.",
        "12:19": "Howbeit Dositheus and Sosipater, who were of Maccabeus’ captains, went forth, and slew those that Timotheus had left in the fortress, above ten thousand men.",
        "12:20": "And Maccabeus ranged his army by bands, and set them over the bands, and went against Timotheus, who had about him an hundred and twenty thousand men of foot, and two thousand and five hundred horsemen.",
        "12:21": "Now when Timotheus had knowledge of Judas’ coming, he sent the women and children and the other baggage unto a fortress called Carnion: for the town was hard to besiege, and uneasy to come unto, by reason of the straitness of all the places.",
        "12:22": "But when Judas his first band came in sight, the enemies, being smitten with fear and terror through the appearing of him who seeth all things, fled amain, one running into this way, another that way, so as that they were often hurt of their own men, and wounded with the points of their own swords.",
        "12:23": "Judas also was very earnest in pursuing them, killing those wicked wretches, of whom he slew about thirty thousand men.",
        "12:24": "Moreover Timotheus himself fell into the hands of Dositheus and Sosipater, whom he besought with much craft to let him go with his life, because he had many of the Jews’ parents, and the brethren of some of them, who, if they put him to death, should not be regarded.",
        "12:25": "So when he had assured them with many words that he would restore them without hurt, according to the agreement, they let him go for the saving of their brethren.",
        "12:26": "Then Maccabeus marched forth to Carnion, and to the temple of Atargatis, and there he slew five and twenty thousand persons.",
        "12:27": "And after he had put to flight and destroyed them, Judas removed the host toward Ephron, a strong city, wherein Lysias abode, and a great multitude of divers nations, and the strong young men kept the walls, and defended them mightily: wherein also was great provision of engines and darts.",
        "12:28": "But when Judas and his company had called upon Almighty God, who with his power breaketh the strength of his enemies, they won the city, and slew twenty and five thousand of them that were within,",
        "12:29": "From thence they departed to Scythopolis, which lieth six hundred furlongs from Jerusalem,",
        "12:30": "But when the Jews that dwelt there had testified that the Scythopolitans dealt lovingly with them, and entreated them kindly in the time of their adversity;",
        "12:31": "They gave them thanks, desiring them to be friendly still unto them: and so they came to Jerusalem, the feast of the weeks approaching.",
        "12:32": "And after the feast, called Pentecost, they went forth against Gorgias the governor of Idumea,",
        "12:33": "Who came out with three thousand men of foot and four hundred horsemen.",
        "12:34": "And it happened that in their fighting together a few of the Jews were slain.",
        "12:35": "At which time Dositheus, one of Bacenor’s company, who was on horseback, and a strong man, was still upon Gorgias, and taking hold of his coat drew him by force; and when he would have taken that cursed man alive, a horseman of Thracia coming upon him smote off his shoulder, so that Gorgias fled unto Marisa.",
        "12:36": "Now when they that were with Gorgias had fought long, and were weary, Judas called upon the Lord, that he would shew himself to be their helper and leader of the battle.",
        "12:37": "And with that he began in his own language, and sung psalms with a loud voice, and rushing unawares upon Gorgias’ men, he put them to flight.",
        "12:38": "So Judas gathered his host, and came into the city of Odollam, And when the seventh day came, they purified themselves, as the custom was, and kept the sabbath in the same place.",
        "12:39": "And upon the day following, as the use had been, Judas and his company came to take up the bodies of them that were slain, and to bury them with their kinsmen in their fathers’ graves.",
        "12:40": "Now under the coats of every one that was slain they found things consecrated to the idols of the Jamnites, which is forbidden the Jews by the law. Then every man saw that this was the cause wherefore they were slain.",
        "12:41": "All men therefore praising the Lord, the righteous Judge, who had opened the things that were hid,",
        "12:42": "Betook themselves unto prayer, and besought him that the sin committed might wholly be put out of remembrance. Besides, that noble Judas exhorted the people to keep themselves from sin, forsomuch as they saw before their eyes the things that came to pass for the sins of those that were slain.",
        "12:43": "And when he had made a gathering throughout the company to the sum of two thousand drachms of silver, he sent it to Jerusalem to offer a sin offering, doing therein very well and honestly, in that he was mindful of the resurrection:",
        "12:44": "For if he had not hoped that they that were slain should have risen again, it had been superfluous and vain to pray for the dead.",
        "12:45": "And also in that he perceived that there was great favour laid up for those that died godly, it was an holy and good thought. Whereupon he made a reconciliation for the dead, that they might be delivered from sin.",
        "13:1": "In the hundred forty and ninth year it was told Judas, that Antiochus Eupator was coming with a great power into Judea,",
        "13:2": "And with him Lysias his protector, and ruler of his affairs, having either of them a Grecian power of footmen, an hundred and ten thousand, and horsemen five thousand and three hundred, and elephants two and twenty, and three hundred chariots armed with hooks.",
        "13:3": "Menelaus also joined himself with them, and with great dissimulation encouraged Antiochus, not for the safeguard of the country, but because he thought to have been made governor.",
        "13:4": "But the King of kings moved Antiochus’ mind against this wicked wretch, and Lysias informed the king that this man was the cause of all mischief, so that the king commanded to bring him unto Berea, and to put him to death, as the manner is in that place.",
        "13:5": "Now there was in that place a tower of fifty cubits high, full of ashes, and it had a round instrument which on every side hanged down into the ashes.",
        "13:6": "And whosoever was condemned of sacrilege, or had committed any other grievous crime, there did all men thrust him unto death.",
        "13:7": "Such a death it happened that wicked man to die, not having so much as burial in the earth; and that most justly:",
        "13:8": "For inasmuch as he had committed many sins about the altar, whose fire and ashes were holy, he received his death in ashes.",
        "13:9": "Now the king came with a barbarous and haughty mind to do far worse to the Jews, than had been done in his father’s time.",
        "13:10": "Which things when Judas perceived, he commanded the multitude to call upon the Lord night and day, that if ever at any other time, he would now also help them, being at the point to be put from their law, from their country, and from the holy temple:",
        "13:11": "And that he would not suffer the people, that had even now been but a little refreshed, to be in subjection to the blasphemous nations.",
        "13:12": "So when they had all done this together, and besought the merciful Lord with weeping and fasting, and lying flat upon the ground three days long, Judas, having exhorted them, commanded they should be in a readiness.",
        "13:13": "And Judas, being apart with the elders, determined, before the king’s host should enter into Judea, and get the city, to go forth and try the matter in fight by the help of the Lord.",
        "13:14": "So when he had committed all to the Creator of the world, and exhorted his soldiers to fight manfully, even unto death, for the laws, the temple, the city, the country, and the commonwealth, he camped by Modin:",
        "13:15": "And having given the watchword to them that were about him, Victory is of God; with the most valiant and choice young men he went in into the king’s tent by night, and slew in the camp about four thousand men, and the chiefest of the elephants, with all that were upon him.",
        "13:16": "And at last they filled the camp with fear and tumult, and departed with good success.",
        "13:17": "This was done in the break of the day, because the protection of the Lord did help him.",
        "13:18": "Now when the king had taken a taste of the manliness of the Jews, he went about to take the holds by policy,",
        "13:19": "And marched toward Bethsura, which was a strong hold of the Jews: but he was put to flight, failed, and lost of his men:",
        "13:20": "For Judas had conveyed unto them that were in it such things as were necessary.",
        "13:21": "But Rhodocus, who was in the Jews’ host, disclosed the secrets to the enemies; therefore he was sought out, and when they had gotten him, they put him in prison.",
        "13:22": "The king treated with them in Bethsum the second time, gave his hand, took their’s, departed, fought with Judas, was overcome;",
        "13:23": "Heard that Philip, who was left over the affairs in Antioch, was desperately bent, confounded, intreated the Jews, submitted himself, and sware to all equal conditions, agreed with them, and offered sacrifice, honoured the temple, and dealt kindly with the place,",
        "13:24": "And accepted well of Maccabeus, made him principal governor from Ptolemais unto the Gerrhenians;",
        "13:25": "Came to Ptolemais: the people there were grieved for the covenants; for they stormed, because they would make their covenants void:",
        "13:26": "Lysias went up to the judgment seat, said as much as could be in defence of the cause, persuaded, pacified, made them well affected, returned to Antioch. Thus it went touching the king’s coming and departing.",
        "14:1": "After three years was Judas informed, that Demetrius the son of Seleucus, having entered by the haven of Tripolis with a great power and navy,",
        "14:2": "Had taken the country, and killed Antiochus, and Lysias his protector.",
        "14:3": "Now one Alcimus, who had been high priest, and had defiled himself wilfully in the times of their mingling with the Gentiles, seeing that by no means he could save himself, nor have any more access to the holy altar,",
        "14:4": "Came to king Demetrius in the hundred and one and fiftieth year, presenting unto him a crown of gold, and a palm, and also of the boughs which were used solemnly in the temple: and so that day he held his peace.",
        "14:5": "Howbeit having gotten opportunity to further his foolish enterprize, and being called into counsel by Demetrius, and asked how the Jews stood affected, and what they intended, he answered thereunto:",
        "14:6": "Those of the Jews that he called Assideans, whose captain is Judas Maccabeus, nourish war and are seditious, and will not let the rest be in peace.",
        "14:7": "Therefore I, being deprived of mine ancestors’ honour, I mean the high priesthood, am now come hither:",
        "14:8": "First, verily for the unfeigned care I have of things pertaining to the king; and secondly, even for that I intend the good of mine own countrymen: for all our nation is in no small misery through the unadvised dealing of them aforersaid.",
        "14:9": "Wherefore, O king, seeing knowest all these things, be careful for the country, and our nation, which is pressed on every side, according to the clemency that thou readily shewest unto all.",
        "14:10": "For as long as Judas liveth, it is not possible that the state should be quiet.",
        "14:11": "This was no sooner spoken of him, but others of the king’s friends, being maliciously set against Judas, did more incense Demetrius.",
        "14:12": "And forthwith calling Nicanor, who had been master of the elephants, and making him governor over Judea, he sent him forth,",
        "14:13": "Commanding him to slay Judas, and to scatter them that were with him, and to make Alcimus high priest of the great temple.",
        "14:14": "Then the heathen, that had fled out of Judea from Judas, came to Nicanor by flocks, thinking the harm and calamities ot the Jews to be their welfare.",
        "14:15": "Now when the Jews heard of Nicanor’s coming, and that the heathen were up against them, they cast earth upon their heads, and made supplication to him that had established his people for ever, and who always helpeth his portion with manifestation of his presence.",
        "14:16": "So at the commandment of the captain they removed straightways from thence, and came near unto them at the town of Dessau.",
        "14:17": "Now Simon, Judas’ brother, had joined battle with Nicanor, but was somewhat discomfited through the sudden silence of his enemies.",
        "14:18": "Nevertheless Nicanor, hearing of the manliness of them that were with Judas, and the courageousness that they had to fight for their country, durst not try the matter by the sword.",
        "14:19": "Wherefore he sent Posidonius, and Theodotus, and Mattathias, to make peace.",
        "14:20": "So when they had taken long advisement thereupon, and the captain had made the multitude acquainted therewith, and it appeared that they were all of one mind, they consented to the covenants,",
        "14:21": "And appointed a day to meet in together by themselves: and when the day came, and stools were set for either of them,",
        "14:22": "Ludas placed armed men ready in convenient places, lest some treachery should be suddenly practised by the enemies: so they made a peaceable conference.",
        "14:23": "Now Nicanor abode in Jerusalem, and did no hurt, but sent away the people that came flocking unto him.",
        "14:24": "And he would not willingly have Judas out of his sight: for he love the man from his heart",
        "14:25": "He prayed him also to take a wife, and to beget children: so he married, was quiet, and took part of this life.",
        "14:26": "But Alcimus, perceiving the love that was betwixt them, and considering the covenants that were made, came to Demetrius, and told him that Nicanor was not well affected toward the state; for that he had ordained Judas, a traitor to his realm, to be the king’s successor.",
        "14:27": "Then the king being in a rage, and provoked with the accusations of the most wicked man, wrote to Nicanor, signifying that he was much displeased with the covenants, and commanding him that he should send Maccabeus prisoner in all haste unto Antioch.",
        "14:28": "When this came to Nicanor’s hearing, he was much confounded in himself, and took it grievously that he should make void the articles which were agreed upon, the man being in no fault.",
        "14:29": "But because there was no dealing against the king, he watched his time to accomplish this thing by policy.",
        "14:30": "Notwithstanding, when Maccabeus saw that Nicanor began to be churlish unto him, and that he entreated him more roughly than he was wont, perceiving that such sour behaviour came not of good, he gathered together not a few of his men, and withdrew himself from Nicanor.",
        "14:31": "But the other, knowing that he was notably prevented by Judas’ policy, came into the great and holy temple, and commanded the priests, that were offering their usual sacrifices, to deliver him the man.",
        "14:32": "And when they sware that they could not tell where the man was whom he sought,",
        "14:33": "He stretched out his right hand toward the temple, and made an oath in this manner: If ye will not deliver me Judas as a prisoner, I will lay this temple of God even with the ground, and I will break down the altar, and erect a notable temple unto Bacchus.",
        "14:34": "After these words he departed. Then the priests lifted up their hands toward heaven, and besought him that was ever a defender of their nation, saying in this manner;",
        "14:35": "Thou, O Lord of all things, who hast need of nothing, wast pleased that the temple of thine habitation should be among us:",
        "14:36": "Therefore now, O holy Lord of all holiness, keep this house ever undefiled, which lately was cleansed, and stop every unrighteous mouth.",
        "14:37": "Now was there accused unto Nicanor one Razis, one of the elders of Jerusalem, a lover of his countrymen, and a man of very good report, who for his kindness was called a father of the Jews.",
        "14:38": "For in the former times, when they mingled not themselves with the Gentiles, he had been accused of Judaism, and did boldly jeopard his body and life with all vehemency for the religion of the Jews.",
        "14:39": "So Nicanor, willing to declare the hate that he bare unto the Jews, sent above five hundred men of war to take him:",
        "14:40": "For he thought by taking him to do the Jews much hurt.",
        "14:41": "Now when the multitude would have taken the tower, and violently broken into the outer door, and bade that fire should be brought to burn it, he being ready to be taken on every side fell upon his sword;",
        "14:42": "Choosing rather to die manfully, than to come into the hands of the wicked, to be abused otherwise than beseemed his noble birth:",
        "14:43": "But missing his stroke through haste, the multitude also rushing within the doors, he ran boldly up to the wall, and cast himself down manfully among the thickest of them.",
        "14:44": "But they quickly giving back, and a space being made, he fell down into the midst of the void place.",
        "14:45": "Nevertheless, while there was yet breath within him, being inflamed with anger, he rose up; and though his blood gushed out like spouts of water, and his wounds were grievous, yet he ran through the midst of the throng; and standing upon a steep rock,",
        "14:46": "When as his blood was now quite gone, he plucked out his bowels, and taking them in both his hands, he cast them upon the throng, and calling upon the Lord of life and spirit to restore him those again, he thus died.",
        "15:1": "But Nicanor, hearing that Judas and his company were in the strong places about Samaria, resolved without any danger to set upon them on the sabbath day.",
        "15:2": "Nevertheless the Jews that were compelled to go with him said, O destroy not so cruelly and barbarously, but give honour to that day, which he, that seeth all things, hath honoured with holiness above all other days.",
        "15:3": "Then the most ungracious wretch demanded, if there were a Mighty one in heaven, that had commanded the sabbath day to be kept.",
        "15:4": "And when they said, There is in heaven a living Lord, and mighty, who commanded the seventh day to be kept:",
        "15:5": "Then said the other, And I also am mighty upon earth, and I command to take arms, and to do the king’s business. Yet he obtained not to have his wicked will done.",
        "15:6": "So Nicanor in exceeding pride and haughtiness determined to set up a publick monument of his victory over Judas and them that were with him.",
        "15:7": "But Maccabeus had ever sure confidence that the Lord would help him:",
        "15:8": "Wherefore he exhorted his people not to fear the coming of the heathen against them, but to remember the help which in former times they had received from heaven, and now to expect the victory and aid, which should come unto them from the Almighty.",
        "15:9": "And so comforting them out of the law and the prophets, and withal putting them in mind of the battles that they won afore, he made them more cheerful.",
        "15:10": "And when he had stirred up their minds, he gave them their charge, shewing them therewithall the falsehood of the heathen, and the breach of oaths.",
        "15:11": "Thus he armed every one of them, not so much with defence of shields and spears, as with comfortable and good words: and beside that, he told them a dream worthy to be believed, as if it had been so indeed, which did not a little rejoice them.",
        "15:12": "And this was his vision: That Onias, who had been high priest, a virtuous and a good man, reverend in conversation, gentle in condition, well spoken also, and exercised from a child in all points of virtue, holding up his hands prayed for the whole body of the Jews.",
        "15:13": "This done, in like manner there appeared a man with gray hairs, and exceeding glorious, who was of a wonderful and excellent majesty.",
        "15:14": "Then Onias answered, saying, This is a lover of the brethren, who prayeth much for the people, and for the holy city, to wit, Jeremias the prophet of God.",
        "15:15": "Whereupon Jeremias holding forth his right hand gave to Judas a sword of gold, and in giving it spake thus,",
        "15:16": "Take this holy sword, a gift from God, with the which thou shalt wound the adversaries.",
        "15:17": "Thus being well comforted by the words of Judas, which were very good, and able to stir them up to valour, and to encourage the hearts of the young men, they determined not to pitch camp, but courageously to set upon them, and manfully to try the matter by conflict, because the city and the sanctuary and the temple were in danger.",
        "15:18": "For the care that they took for their wives, and their children, their brethren, and folks, was in least account with them: but the greatest and principal fear was for the holy temple.",
        "15:19": "Also they that were in the city took not the least care, being troubled for the conflict abroad.",
        "15:20": "And now, when as all looked what should be the trial, and the enemies were already come near, and the army was set in array, and the beasts conveniently placed, and the horsemen set in wings,",
        "15:21": "Maccabeus seeing the coming of the multitude, and the divers preparations of armour, and the fierceness of the beasts, stretched out his hands toward heaven, and called upon the Lord that worketh wonders, knowing that victory cometh not by arms, but even as it seemeth good to him, he giveth it to such as are worthy:",
        "15:22": "Therefore in his prayer he said after this manner; O Lord, thou didst send thine angel in the time of Ezekias king of Judea, and didst slay in the host of Sennacherib an hundred fourscore and five thousand:",
        "15:23": "Wherefore now also, O Lord of heaven, send a good angel before us for a fear and dread unto them;",
        "15:24": "And through the might of thine arm let those be stricken with terror, that come against thy holy people to blaspheme. And he ended thus.",
        "15:25": "Then Nicanor and they that were with him came forward with trumpets and songs.",
        "15:26": "But Judas and his company encountered the enemies with invocation and prayer.",
        "15:27": "So that fighting with their hands, and praying unto God with their hearts, they slew no less than thirty and five thousand men: for through the appearance of God they were greatly cheered.",
        "15:28": "Now when the battle was done, returning again with joy, they knew that Nicanor lay dead in his harness.",
        "15:29": "Then they made a great shout and a noise, praising the Almighty in their own language.",
        "15:30": "And Judas, who was ever the chief defender of the citizens both in body and mind, and who continued his love toward his countrymen all his life, commanded to strike off Nicanor’s head, and his hand with his shoulder, and bring them to Jerusalem.",
        "15:31": "So when he was there, and called them of his nation together, and set the priests before the altar, he sent for them that were of the tower,",
        "15:32": "And shewed them vile Nicanor’s head, and the hand of that blasphemer, which with proud brags he had stretched out against the holy temple of the Almighty.",
        "15:33": "And when he had cut out the tongue of that ungodly Nicanor, he commanded that they should give it by pieces unto the fowls, and hang up the reward of his madness before the temple.",
        "15:34": "So every man praised toward the heaven the glorious Lord, saying, Blessed be he that hath kept his own place undefiled.",

        "18:3": "⌈⌈And I saw how the winds stretch out the vaults of heaven⌉⌉, and have their station between heaven and earth: ⌈⌈these are the pillars of the heaven⌉⌉.",
        "18:4": "I saw the winds of heaven which turn and bring the circumference of the sun and all the stars to their setting.",
        "18:5": "I saw the winds on the earth carrying the clouds: I saw ⌈⌈the paths of the angels. I saw⌉⌉ at the end of the earth the firmament of the heaven above. And I proceeded and saw a place which burns day and night, where there are seven mountains of magnificent stones, three towards the east, and three towards the south.",
        "18:7": "And as for those towards the east, 〈one〉 was of coloured stone, and one of pearl, and one of jacinth, and those towards the south of red stone.",
        "18:8": "But the middle one reached to heaven like the throne of God, of alabaster, and the summit of the throne was of sapphire.",
        "18:9": "And I saw a flaming fire. And beyond these mountains",
        "18:10": "is a region the end of the great earth: there the heavens were completed.",
        "18:11": "And I saw a deep abyss, with columns ⌈⌈of heavenly fire, and among them I saw columns⌉⌉ of fire fall, which were beyond measure alike towards the height and towards the depth.",
        "18:12": "And beyond that abyss I saw a place which had no firmament of the heaven above, and no firmly founded earth beneath it: there was no water upon it, and no birds, but it was a waste and horrible place.",
        "18:13": "I saw there seven stars like great burning mountains, and to me, when I inquired regarding them,",
        "18:14": "The angel said: 'This place is the end of heaven and earth: this has become a prison for the stars and the host of heaven.",
        "18:15": "And the stars which roll over the fire are they which have transgressed the commandment of the Lord in the beginning of their rising, because they did not come forth at their appointed times.",
        "18:16": "And He was wroth with them, and bound them till the time when their guilt should be consummated (even) ⌈for ten thousand years⌉.'",
        "19:1": "And Uriel said to me: 'Here shall stand the angels who have connected themselves with women, and their spirits assuming many different forms are defiling mankind and shall lead them astray into sacrificing to demons ⌈⌈as gods⌉⌉, (here shall they stand,) till ⌈⌈the day of⌉⌉ the great judgement in which they shall be judged till they are made an end of.",
        "19:2": "And the women also of the angels who went astray shall become sirens.'",
        "19:3": "And I, Enoch, alone saw the vision, the ends of all things: and no man shall see as I have seen.",
        "20:1": "And these are the names of the holy angels who watch.",

        "20:4": "Raguel, one of the holy angels who †takes vengeance on† the world of the luminaries.",
        "20:5": "Michael, one of the holy angels, to wit, he that is set over the best part of mankind ⌈⌈and⌉⌉ over chaos.",
        "20:6": "Saraqâêl, one of the holy angels, who is set over the spirits, who sin in the spirit.",
        "20:7": "Gabriel, one of the holy angels, who is over Paradise and the serpents and the Cherubim.",
        "20:8": "Remiel, one of the holy angels, whom God set over those who rise.",
        "21:1": "And I proceeded to where things were chaotic.",
        "21:2": "And I saw there something horrible: I saw neither a heaven above nor a firmly founded earth, but a place chaotic and horrible.",
        "21:3": "And there I saw seven stars of the heaven bound together in it, like great mountains and burning with fire.",
        "21:4": "Then I said: 'For what sin are they bound, and on what account have they been cast in hither?'",
        "21:5": "Then said Uriel, one of the holy angels, who was with me, and was chief over them, and said: 'Enoch, why dost thou ask, and why art thou eager for the truth?",
        "21:6": "These are of the number of the stars ⌈of heaven⌉, which have transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and are bound here till ten thousand years, the time entailed by their sins, are consummated.'",
        "21:7": "And from thence I went to another place, which was still more horrible than the former, and I saw a horrible thing: a great fire there which burnt and blazed, and the place was cleft as far as the abyss, being full of great descending columns of fire: neither its extent or magnitude could I see, nor could I conjecture.",
        "21:8": "Then I said: 'How fearful is the place and how terrible to look upon!'",
        "21:9": "Then Uriel answered me, one of the holy angels who was with me, and said unto me: 'Enoch, why hast thou such fear and affright?' And I answered: 'Because of this fearful place, and because of the spectacle of the pain.'",
        "21:10": "And he said ⌈⌈unto me⌉⌉: 'This place is the prison of the angels, and here they will be imprisoned for ever.'",
        "22:1": "And thence I went to another place, and he showed me in the west ⌈another⌉ great and high mountain [and] of hard rock. \n E",
        "22:2": "And there were †four† hollow places in it, deep and very smooth: †three† of them were dark and one bright; and there was a fountain of water in its midst. And I said: '†How† smooth are these hollow places, and deep and dark to view.'",
        "22:3": "Then Raphael answered, one of the holy angels who was with me, and said unto me: 'These hollow places have been created for this very purpose, that the spirits of the souls of the dead should assemble therein, yea that all the souls of the children of men should assemble here. And these places have been made to receive them till the day of their judgement and till their appointed period ⌈till the period appointed⌉, till the great judgement (comes) upon them.' \n E",
        "22:5": "I saw (the spirit of) a dead man making suit, and his voice went forth to heaven and made suit.",
        "22:6": "And I asked Raphael the angel who was with me, and I said unto him: 'This spirit which maketh suit, whose is it, whose voice goeth forth and maketh suit to heaven?'",
        "22:7": "And he answered me saying: 'This is the spirit which went forth from Abel, whom his brother Cain slew, and he makes his suit against him till his seed is destroyed from the face of the earth, and his seed is annihilated from amongst the seed of men.' \nE",
        "22:8": "Then I asked regarding all the hollow places: 'Why is one separated from the other?'",
        "22:9": "And he answered me saying: 'These three have been made that the spirits of the dead might be separated. And this division has been made for the spirits of the righteous, in which there is the bright spring of water.",
        "22:10": "And this has been made for sinners \n\n   \nE \nbeen made for sinners when they die and are buried in the earth and judgement has not been executed on them in their lifetime.",
        "22:11": "Here their spirits shall be set apart in this great pain, till the great day of judgement, scourgings, and torments of the accursed for ever, so that (there maybe) retribution for their spirits. There He shall bind them for ever.",
        "22:12": "And this division has been made for the spirits of those who make their suit, who make disclosures concerning their destruction, when they were slain in the days of the sinners.",
        "22:13": "And this has been made for the spirits of men who shall not be righteous but sinners, who are godless, and of the lawless they shall be companions: but their spirits shall not be punished in the day of judgement nor shall they be raised from thence.",
        "22:14": "Then I blessed the Lord of Glory and said: 'Blessed art Thou, Lord of righteousness, who rulest over the world.'",
        "23:1": "From thence I went to another place to the west of the ends of the earth.",
        "23:2": "And I saw a ⌈⌈burning⌉⌉ fire which ran without resting, and paused not from its course day or night but (ran) regularly.",
        "23:3": "And I asked saying: 'What is this which rests not?'",
        "23:4": "Then Raguel, one of the holy angels who was with me, answered me ⌈⌈and said unto me⌉⌉: 'This course ⌈of fire⌉ ⌈⌈which thou hast seen⌉⌉ is the fire in the west which †persecutes† all the luminaries of heaven.'",
        "24:1": "⌈⌈And from thence I went to another place of the earth⌉⌉, and he showed me a mountain range of fire which burnt ⌈⌈day and night⌉⌉.",
        "24:2": "And I went beyond it and saw seven magnificent mountains all differing each from the other, and the stones (thereof) were magnificent and beautiful, magnificent as a whole, of glorious appearance and fair exterior: ⌈⌈three towards⌉⌉ the east, ⌈⌈one⌉⌉ founded on the other, and three towards the south, one upon the other, and deep rough ravines, no one of which joined with any other.",
        "24:3": "And the seventh mountain was in the midst of these, and it excelled them in height, resembling the seat of a throne: and fragrant trees encircled the throne.",
        "24:4": "And amongst them was a tree such as I had never yet smelt, neither was any amongst them nor were others like it: it had a fragrance beyond all fragrance, and its leaves and blooms and wood wither not for ever: and its fruit ⌈⌈is beautiful, and its fruit⌉⌉ resembles the dates of a palm.",
        "24:5": "Then I said: '⌈How⌉ beautiful is this tree, and fragrant, and its leaves are fair, and its blooms ⌈⌈very⌉⌉ delightful in appearance.'",
        "24:6": "Then answered Michael, one of the holy ⌈⌈and honoured⌉⌉ angels who was with me, and was their leader.",
        "25:1": "And he said unto me: 'Enoch, why dost thou ask me regarding the fragrance of the tree, and ⌈why⌉ dost thou wish to learn the truth?' Then I answered him ⌈⌈saying⌉⌉: 'I wish to know about everything, but especially about this tree.' And he answered saying: 'This high mountain ⌈⌈which thou hast seen⌉⌉, whose summit is like the throne of God, is His throne, where the Holy Great One, the Lord of Glory, the Eternal King, will sit, when He shall come down to visit the earth with goodness.",
        "25:4": "And as for this fragrant tree no mortal is permitted to touch it till the great judgement, when He shall take vengeance on all and bring (everything) to its consummation for ever. It shall then be given to the righteous and holy.",
        "25:5": "Its fruit shall be for food to the elect: it shall be transplanted to the holy place, to the temple of the Lord, the Eternal King.",
        "25:6": "Then shall they rejoice with joy and be glad, And into the holy place shall they enter; And its fragrance shall be in their bones, And they shall live a long life on earth, Such as thy fathers lived: And in their days shall no ⌈⌈sorrow or⌉⌉ plague Or torment or calamity touch them.'",
        "25:7": "Then blessed I the God of Glory, the Eternal King, who hath prepared such things for the righteous, and hath created them and promised to give to them.",
        "26:1": "And I went from thence to the middle of the earth, and I saw a blessed place ⌈in which there were trees⌉ with branches abiding and blooming [of a dismembered tree].",
        "26:2": "And there I saw a holy mountain, ⌈⌈and⌉⌉ underneath the mountain to the east there was a stream and it flowed towards the south.",
        "26:3": "And I saw towards the east another mountain higher than this, and between them a deep and narrow ravine: in it also ran a stream ⌈underneath⌉ the mountain.",
        "26:4": "And to the west thereof there was another mountain, lower than the former and of small elevation, and a ravine ⌈deep and dry⌉ between them: and another deep and dry ravine was at the extremities of the three ⌈mountains⌉.",
        "26:5": "And all the ravines were deep ⌈⌈and narrow⌉⌉, (being formed) of hard rock, and trees were not planted upon them.",
        "26:6": "And I marveled ⌈⌈at the rocks, and I marveled⌉⌉ at the ravine, yea, I marveled very much.",
        "27:1": "Then said I: 'For what object is this blessed land, which is entirely filled with trees, and this accursed valley ⌈⌈between⌉⌉?'",
        "27:2": "⌈⌈Then Uriel, one of the holy angels who was with me, answered and said: 'This⌉⌉ accursed valley is for those who are accursed for ever: Here shall all ⌈the accursed⌉ be gathered together who utter with their lips against the Lord unseemly words and of His glory speak hard things. \nE \nHere shall they be gathered together, and here shall be their place of judgement.",
        "27:3": "In the last times, in the days of the true judgement in the presence of the righteous for ever: here shall the godly bless the Lord of Glory, the Eternal Kin.",
        "27:4": "In the days of judgement over the former, they shall bless Him for the mercy in accordance with which He has assigned them (their lot).'",
        "27:5": "Then I blessed the Lord of Glory and set forth His ⌈glory⌉ and lauded Him gloriously.",
        "28:1": "And thence I went ⌈⌈towards the east⌉⌉, into the midst ⌈⌈of the mountain range of the desert⌉⌉, and I saw a wilderness and it was solitary, full of trees and plants.",
        "28:2": "⌈⌈And⌉⌉ water gushed forth from above.",
        "28:3": "Rushing like a copious watercourse [which flowed] towards the north-west it caused clouds and dew to ascend on every side.",
        "29:1": "And thence I went to another place in the desert, and approached to the east of this mountain range.",
        "29:2": "And ⌈⌈there⌉⌉ I saw aromatic trees exhaling the fragrance of frankincense and myrrh, and the trees also were similar to the almond tree.",
        "30:1": ".And beyond these, I went afar to the east, and I saw another place, a valley (full) of water.",
        "30:2": "And ⌈therein there was⌉ a tree, the colour (?) of fragrant trees such as the mastic.",
        "30:3": "And on the sides of those valleys I saw fragrant cinnamon. And beyond these I proceeded to the east.",
        "31:1": "And I saw other mountains, and amongst them were ⌈groves of⌉ trees, and there flowed forth from them nectar, which is named sarara and galbanum.",
        "31:2": "And beyond these mountains I saw another mountain ⌈to the east of the ends of the earth⌉, ⌈⌈whereon were aloe trees⌉⌉, and all the trees were full of stacte, being like almond-trees.",
        "31:3": "And when one burnt it, it smelt sweeter than any fragrant odour.",
        "32:1": "To the north-east I beheld seven mountains full of choice nard and mastic and cinnamon and pepper.",
        "32:2": "And thence I went over the summits of ⌈all⌉ these mountains, far towards the east ⌈of the earth⌉, and passed above the Erythraean sea and went far from it, and passed over ⌈⌈the angel⌉⌉ Zotîêl.\nE",
        "32:3": "And I came to the Garden of Righteousness, and from afar off trees more numerous than these trees and great--†two† trees there, very great, beautiful, and glorious, and magnificent, and the tree of knowledge, whose holy fruit they eat and know great wisdom.",
        "32:4": "⌈That tree is in height like the fir, and its leaves are⌉ like (those of) the Carob tree: and its fruit is like the clusters of the vine, very beautiful: and the fragrance of the tree penetrates afar.",
        "32:5": "Then I said: '⌈How⌉ beautiful is the tree, and how attractive is its look!'",
        "32:6": "Then Raphael the holy angel, who was with me, answered me ⌈⌈and said⌉⌉: 'This is the tree of wisdom, of which thy father old (in years) and thy aged mother, who were before thee, have eaten, and they learnt wisdom and their eyes were opened, and they knew that they were naked and they were driven out of the garden.'",
        "33:1": "And from thence I went to the ends of the earth and saw there great beasts, and each differed from the other; and (I saw) birds also differing in appearance and beauty and voice, the one differing from the other.",
        "33:2": "And to the east of those beasts I saw the ends of the earth whereon the heaven rests, and the portals of the heaven open.",
        "33:3": "And I saw how the stars of heaven come forth, and I counted the portals out of which they proceed, and wrote down all their outlets, of each individual star by itself, according to their number and their names, their courses and their positions, and their times and their months, as Uriel the holy angel who was with me showed me.",
        "33:4": "He showed all things to me and wrote them down for me: also their names he wrote for me, and their laws and their companies.",
        "34:1": "And from thence I went towards the north to the ends of the earth, and there I saw a great and glorious device at the ends of the whole earth.",
        "34:2": "And here I saw three portals of heaven open in the heaven: through each of them proceed north winds: when they blow there is cold, hail, frost, snow, dew, and rain.",
        "34:3": "And out of one portal they blow for good: but when they blow through the other two portals, it is with violence and affliction on the earth, and they blow with violence.",
        "35:1": "And from thence I went towards the west to the ends of the earth, and saw there three portals of the heaven open such as I had seen in the †east†, the same number of portals, and the same number of outlets.",
        "36:1": "And from thence I went to the south to the ends of the earth, and saw there three open portals of the heaven: and thence there come dew, rain, †and wind†.",
        "36:2": "And from thence I went to the east to the ends of the heaven, and saw here the three eastern portals of heaven open and small portals above them.",
        "36:3": "Through each of these small portals pass the stars of heaven and run their course to the west on the path which is shown to them.",
        "36:4": "And as often as I saw I blessed always the Lord of Glory, and I continued to bless the Lord of Glory who has wrought great and glorious wonders, to show the greatness of His work to the angels and to spirits and to men, that they might praise His work and all His creation: that they might see the work of His might and praise the great work of His hands and bless Him for ever.",
        "37:1": "The second vision which he saw, the vision of wisdom--which Enoch the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel, the son of Cainan, the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, saw.",
        "37:2": "And this is the beginning of the words of wisdom which I lifted up my voice to speak and say to those which dwell on earth: Hear, ye men of old time, and see, ye that come after, the words of the Holy One which I will speak before the Lord of Spirits.",
        "37:3": "It were better to declare (them only) to the men of old time, but even from those that come after we will not withhold the beginning of wisdom.",
        "37:4": "Till the present day such wisdom has never been given by the Lord of Spirits as I have received according to my insight, according to the good pleasure of the Lord of Spirits by whom the lot of eternal life has been given to me.",
        "37:5": "Now three parables were imparted to me, and I lifted up my voice and recounted them to those that dwell on the earth.",
        "38:1": "The First Parable. When the congregation of the righteous shall appear, And sinners shall be judged for their sins, And shall be driven from the face of the earth:",
        "38:2": "And when the Righteous One shall appear before the eyes of the righteous, Whose elect works hang upon the Lord of Spirits, And light shall appear to the righteous and the elect who dwell on the earth, Where then will be the dwelling of the sinners, And where the resting-place of those who have denied the Lord of Spirits? It had been good for them if they had not been born.",
        "38:3": "When the secrets of the righteous shall be revealed and the sinners judged, And the godless driven from the presence of the righteous and elect,",
        "38:4": "From that time those that possess the earth shall no longer be powerful and exalted:\nAnd they shall not be able to behold the face of the holy, For the Lord of Spirits has caused His light to appear On the face of the holy, righteous, and elect.",
        "38:5": "Then shall the kings and the mighty perish And be given into the hands of the righteous and holy.",
        "38:6": "And thenceforward none shall seek for themselves mercy from the Lord of Spirits For their life is at an end.",
        "39:1": "[And it †shall come to pass in those days that elect and holy children †will descend from the high heaven, and their seed †will become one with the children of men.",
        "39:2": "And in those days Enoch received books of zeal and wrath, and books of disquiet and expulsion.] \nAnd mercy shall not be accorded to them, saith the Lord of Spirits.",
        "39:3": "And in those days a whirlwind carried me off from the earth, And set me down at the end of the heavens.",
        "39:4": "And there I saw another vision, the dwelling-places of the holy, And the resting-places of the righteous.",
        "39:5": "Here mine eyes saw their dwellings with His righteous angels, And their resting-places with the holy.\nAnd they petitioned and interceded and prayed for the children of men, And righteousness flowed before them as water,\nAnd mercy like dew upon the earth: Thus it is amongst them for ever and ever.\n[39:6a] And in that place mine eyes saw the Elect One of righteousness and of faith, [39:7a] And I saw his dwelling-place under the wings of the Lord of Spirits. [39:6b] And righteousness shall prevail in his days, And the righteous and elect shall be without number before Him for ever and ever. [39:7b] And all the righteous and elect before Him shall be †strong† as fiery lights, And their mouth shall be full of blessing,\nAnd their lips extol the name of the Lord of Spirits, And righteousness before Him shall never fail, [And uprightness shall never fail before Him.]",
        "39:8": "There I wished to dwell, And my spirit longed for that dwelling-place:\nAnd there heretofore hath been my portion, For so has it been established concerning me before the Lord of Spirits.",
        "39:9": "In those days I praised and extolled the name of the Lord of Spirits with blessings and praises, because He hath destined me for blessing and glory according to the good pleasure of the Lord of Spirits.",
        "39:10": "For a long time my eyes regarded that place, and I blessed Him and praised Him, saying: 'Blessed is He, and may He be blessed from the beginning and for evermore.",
        "39:11": "And before Him there is no ceasing. He knows before the world was created what is for ever and what will be from generation unto generation.",
        "39:12": "Those who sleep not bless Thee: they stand before Thy glory and bless, praise, and extol, saying: \"Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of Spirits: He filleth the earth with spirits.\"'",
        "39:13": "And here my eyes saw all those who sleep not: they stand before Him and bless and say: 'Blessed be Thou, and blessed be the name of the Lord for ever and ever.'",
        "39:14": "And my face was changed; for I could no longer behold.",
        "40:1": "And after that I saw thousands of thousands and ten thousand times ten thousand, I saw a multitude beyond number and reckoning, who stood before the Lord of Spirits.",
        "40:2": "And on the four sides of the Lord of Spirits I saw four presences, different from those that sleep not, and I learnt their names: for the angel that went with me made known to me their names, and showed me all the hidden things.",
        "40:3": "And I heard the voices of those four presences as they uttered praises before the Lord of glory.",
        "40:4": "The first voice blesses the Lord of Spirits for ever and ever.",
        "40:5": "And the second voice I heard blessing the Elect One and the elect ones who hang upon the Lord of Spirits.",
        "40:6": "And the third voice I heard pray and intercede for those who dwell on the earth and supplicate in the name of the Lord of Spirits.",
        "40:7": "And I heard the fourth voice fending off the Satans and forbidding them to come before the Lord of Spirits to accuse them who dwell on the earth.",
        "40:8": "After that I asked the angel of peace who went with me, who showed me everything that is hidden: 'Who are these four presences which I have seen and whose words I have heard and written down?'",
        "40:9": "And he said to me: 'This first is Michael, the merciful and long-suffering: and the second, who is set over all the diseases and all the wounds of the children of men, is Raphael: and the third, who is set over all the powers, is Gabriel: and the fourth, who is set over the repentance unto hope of those who inherit eternal life, is named Phanuel.' And these are the four angels of the Lord of Spirits and the four voices I heard in those days.",
        "41:1": "And after that I saw all the secrets of the heavens, and how the kingdom is divided, and how the actions of men are weighed in the balance.",
        "41:2": "And there I saw the mansions of the elect and the mansions of the holy, and mine eyes saw there all the sinners being driven from thence which deny the name of the Lord of Spirits, and being dragged off: and they could not abide because of the punishment which proceeds from the Lord of Spirits.",
        "41:3": "And there mine eyes saw the secrets of the lightning and of the thunder, and the secrets of the winds, how they are divided to blow over the earth, and the secrets of the clouds and dew, and there I saw from whence they proceed in that place and from whence they saturate the dusty earth.",
        "41:4": "And there I saw closed chambers out of which the winds are divided, the chamber of the hail and winds, the chamber of the mist, and of the clouds, and the cloud thereof hovers over the earth from the beginning of the world.",
        "41:5": "And I saw the chambers of the sun and moon, whence they proceed and whither they come again, and their glorious return, and how one is superior to the other, and their stately orbit, and how they do not leave their orbit, and they add nothing to their orbit and they take nothing from it, and they keep faith with each other, in accordance with the oath by which they are bound together.",
        "41:6": "And first the sun goes forth and traverses his path according to the commandment of the Lord of Spirits, and mighty is His name for ever and ever.",
        "41:7": "And after that I saw the hidden and the visible path of the moon, and she accomplishes the course of her path in that place by day and by night--the one holding a position opposite to the other before the Lord of Spirits. \nAnd they give thanks and praise and rest not; For unto them is their thanksgiving rest.",
        "41:8": "For the sun changes oft for a blessing or a curse, And the course of the path of the moon is light to the righteous And darkness to the sinners in the name of the Lord,\nWho made a separation between the light and the darkness, And divided the spirits of men,\nAnd strengthened the spirits of the righteous, In the name of His righteousness.",
        "41:9": "For no angel hinders and no power is able to hinder; for He appoints a judge for them all and He judges them all before Him.",
        "42:1": "Wisdom found no place where she might dwell; Then a dwelling-place was assigned her in the heavens.",
        "42:2": "Wisdom went forth to make her dwelling among the children of men, And found no dwelling-place:\nWisdom returned to her place, And took her seat among the angels.",
        "42:3": "And unrighteousness went forth from her chambers: Whom she sought not she found, And dwelt with them, \nAs rain in a desert And dew on a thirsty land.",
        "43:1": "And I saw other lightnings and the stars of heaven, and I saw how He called them all by their names and they hearkened unto Him.",
        "43:2": "And I saw how they are weighed in a righteous balance according to their proportions of light: (I saw) the width of their spaces and the day of their appearing, and how their revolution produces lightning: and (I saw) their revolution according to the number of the angels, and (how) they keep faith with each other.",
        "43:3": "And I asked the angel who went with me who showed me what was hidden: 'What are these?'",
        "43:4": "And he said to me: 'The Lord of Spirits hath showed thee their parabolic meaning (lit. 'their parable'): these are the names of the holy who dwell on the earth and believe in the name of the Lord of Spirits for ever and ever.'",
        "45:1": "And this is the Second Parable concerning those who deny the name of the dwelling of the holy ones and the Lord of Spirits.",
        "45:2": "And into the heaven they shall not ascend, And on the earth they shall not come: Such shall be the lot of the sinners Who have denied the name of the Lord of Spirits, Who are thus preserved for the day of suffering and tribulation.",
        "45:3": "On that day Mine Elect One shall sit on the throne of glory And shall try their works, And their places of rest shall be innumerable.\nAnd their souls shall grow strong within them when they see Mine Elect Ones, And those who have called upon My glorious name:",
        "45:4": "Then will I cause Mine Elect One to dwell among them.\nAnd I will transform the heaven and make it an eternal blessing and light",
        "45:5": "And I will transform the earth and make it a blessing:\nAnd I will cause Mine elect ones to dwell upon it: But the sinners and evil-doers shall not set foot thereon.",
        "45:6": "For I have provided and satisfied with peace My righteous ones And have caused them to dwell before Me:\nBut for the sinners there is judgement impending with Me, So that I shall destroy them from the face of the earth.",
        "46:1": "And there I saw One who had a head of days, And His head was white like wool, And with Him was another being whose countenance had the appearance of a man, And his face was full of graciousness, like one of the holy angels.",
        "46:2": "And I asked the angel who went with me and showed me all the hidden things, concerning that Son of Man, who he was, and whence he was, (and) why he went with the Head of Days? And he answered and said unto me: \nThis is the son of Man who hath righteousness, With whom dwelleth righteousness, And who revealeth all the treasures of that which is hidden,\nBecause the Lord of Spirits hath chosen him, And whose lot hath the pre-eminence before the Lord of Spirits in uprightness for ever.",
        "46:4": ", And this Son of Man whom thou hast seen Shall †raise up† the kings and the mighty from their seats, [And the strong from their thrones]\nAnd shall loosen the reins of the strong, And break the teeth of the sinners.",
        "46:5": "[And he shall put down the kings from their thrones and kingdoms] Because they do not extol and praise Him, Nor humbly acknowledge whence the kingdom was bestowed upon them.",
        "46:6": "And he shall put down the countenance of the strong, And shall fill them with shame.\nAnd darkness shall be their dwelling, And worms shall be their bed, And they shall have no hope of rising from their beds, Because they do not extol the name of the Lord of Spirits.",
        "46:7": "And these are they who †judge† the stars of heaven, [And raise their hands against the Most High], †And tread upon the earth and dwell upon it†.\nAnd all their deeds manifest unrighteousness, And their power rests upon their riches, And their faith is in the †gods† which they have made with their hands, And they deny the name of the Lord of Spirits,",
        "46:8": "And they persecute the houses of His congregations, And the faithful who hang upon the name of the Lord of Spirits.",
        "47:1": "And in those days shall have ascended the prayer of the righteous, And the blood of the righteous from the earth before the Lord of Spirits.",
        "47:2": "In those days the holy ones who dwell above in the heavens Shall unite with one voice And supplicate and pray [and praise, And give thanks and bless the name of the Lord of Spirits] On behalf of the blood of the righteous which has been shed, And that the prayer of the righteous may not be in vain before the Lord of Spirits, That judgement may be done unto them, And that they may not have to suffer for ever.",
        "47:3": "In those days I saw the Head of Days when He seated himself upon the throne of His glory, And the books of the living were opened before Him: And all His host which is in heaven above and His counselors stood before Him,",
        "47:4": "And the hearts of the holy were filled with joy; Because the number of the righteous had been offered, And the prayer of the righteous had been heard, And the blood of the righteous been required before the Lord of Spirits.",
        "48:1": "And in that place I saw the fountain of righteousness Which was inexhaustible: And around it were many fountains of wisdom;\nAnd all the thirsty drank of them, And were filled with wisdom, And their dwellings were with the righteous and holy and elect.",
        "48:2": "And at that hour that Son of Man was named In the presence of the Lord of Spirits, And his name before the Head of Days.",
        "48:3": "Yea, before the sun and the signs were created, Before the stars of the heaven were made, His name was named before the Lord of Spirits.",
        "48:4": "He shall be a staff to the righteous whereon to stay themselves and not fall, And he shall be the light of the Gentiles, And the hope of those who are troubled of heart.",
        "48:5": "All who dwell on earth shall fall down and worship before him, And will praise and bless and celebrate with song the Lord of Spirits.",
        "48:6": "And for this reason hath he been chosen and hidden before Him, Before the creation of the world and for evermore.",
        "48:7": "And the wisdom of the Lord of Spirits hath revealed him to the holy and righteous; For he hath preserved the lot of the righteous, Because they have hated and despised this world of unrighteousness, And have hated all its works and ways in the name of the Lord of Spirits: For in his name they are saved, And according to his good pleasure hath it been in regard to their life.",
        "48:8": "In these days downcast in countenance shall the kings of the earth have become, And the strong who possess the land because of the works of their hands;\nFor on the day of their anguish and affliction they shall not (be able to) save themselves.",
        "48:9": "And I will give them over into the hands of Mine elect:\nAs straw in the fire so shall they burn before the face of the holy: As lead in the water shall they sink before the face of the righteous, And no trace of them shall any more be found.",
        "48:10": "And on the day of their affliction there shall be rest on the earth, And before them they shall fall and not rise again:\nAnd there shall be no one to take them with his hands and raise them: For they have denied the Lord of Spirits and His Anointed. The name of the Lord of Spirits be blessed.",
        "49:1": "For wisdom is poured out like water, And glory faileth not before him for evermore.",
        "49:2": "For he is mighty in all the secrets of righteousness, And unrighteousness shall disappear as a shadow, And have no continuance; Because the Elect One standeth before the Lord of Spirits, And his glory is for ever and ever, And his might unto all generations.",
        "49:3": "And in him dwells the spirit of wisdom, And the spirit which gives insight, And the spirit of understanding and of might, And the spiritopt of those who have fallen asleep in righteousness.",
        "49:4": "And he shall judge the secret things, And none shall be able to utter a lying word before him; For he is the Elect One before the Lord of Spirits according to His good pleasure.",
        "50:1": "And in those days a change shall take place for the holy and elect, And the light of days shall abide upon them, And glory and honour shall turn to the holy,",
        "50:2": "On the day of affliction on which evil shall have been treasured up against the sinners.\nAnd the righteous shall be victorious in the name of the Lord of Spirits: And He will cause the others to witness (this) That they may repent And forgo the works of their hands.",
        "50:3": "They shall have no honour through the name of the Lord of Spirits, Yet through His name shall they be saved, And the Lord of Spirits will have compassion on them, For His compassion is great.",
        "50:4": "And He is righteous also in His judgement, And in the presence of His glory unrighteousness also shall not maintain itself: At His judgement the unrepentant shall perish before Him.",
        "50:5": "And from henceforth I will have no mercy on them, saith the Lord of Spirits.",
        "51:1": "And in those days shall the earth also give back that which has been entrusted to it, And Sheol also shall give back that which it has received, And hell shall give back that which it owes.\n[51:5a] For in those days the Elect One shall arise,",
        "51:2": "And he shall choose the righteous and holy from among them: For the day has drawn nigh that they should be saved.",
        "51:3": "And the Elect One shall in those days sit on My throne, And his mouth shall pour forth all the secrets of wisdom and counsel: For the Lord of Spirits hath given (them) to him and hath glorified him.",
        "51:4": "And in those days shall the mountains leap like rams, And the hills also shall skip like lambs satisfied with milk, And the faces of ⌈all⌉ the angels in heaven shall be lighted up with joy.\n[51:5b] And the earth shall rejoice, c. And the righteous shall dwell upon it, d. And the elect shall walk thereon.",
        "52:1": "And after those days in that place where I had seen all the visions of that which is hidden--for I had been carried off in a whirlwind and they had borne me towards the west--",
        "52:2": "There mine eyes saw all the secret things of heaven that shall be, a mountain of iron, and a mountain of copper, and a mountain of silver, and a mountain of gold, and a mountain of soft metal, and a mountain of lead.",
        "52:3": "And I asked the angel who went with me, saying, 'What things are these which I have seen in secret?'",
        "52:4": "And he said unto me: 'All these things which thou hast seen shall serve the dominion of His Anointed that he may be potent and mighty on the earth.'",
        "52:5": "And that angel of peace answered, saying unto me: 'Wait a little, and there shall be revealed unto thee all the secret things which surround the Lord of Spirits.",
        "52:6": "And these mountains which thine eyes have seen, The mountain of iron, and the mountain of copper, and the mountain of silver, And the mountain of gold, and the mountain of soft metal, and the mountain of lead, All these shall be in the presence of the Elect One As wax: before the fire, And like the water which streams down from above [upon those mountains], And they shall become powerless before his feet.",
        "52:7": "And it shall come to pass in those days that none shall be saved, Either by gold or by silver, And none be able to escape.",
        "52:8": "And there shall be no iron for war, Nor shall one clothe oneself with a breastplate. Bronze shall be of no service, And tin [shall be of no service and] shall not be esteemed, And lead shall not be desired.",
        "52:9": "And all these things shall be [denied and] destroyed from the surface of the earth, When the Elect One shall appear before the face of the Lord of Spirits.'",
        "53:1": "There mine eyes saw a deep valley with open mouths, and all who dwell on the earth and sea and islands shall bring to him gifts and presents and tokens of homage, but that deep valley shall not become full.",
        "53:2": "And their hands commit lawless deeds, And the sinners devour all whom they lawlessly oppress: Yet the sinners shall be destroyed before the face of the Lord of Spirits, And they shall be banished from off the face of His earth, And they shall perish for ever and ever.",
        "53:3": "For I saw all the angels of punishment abiding (there) and preparing all the instruments of Satan.",
        "53:4": "And I asked the angel of peace who went with me: 'For whom are they preparing these instruments?'",
        "53:5": "And he said unto me: 'They prepare these for the kings and the mighty of this earth, that they may thereby be destroyed.",
        "53:6": "And after this the Righteous and Elect One shall cause the house of his congregation to appear: henceforth they shall be no more hindered in the name of the Lord of Spirits.",
        "53:7": "And these mountains shall not stand as the earth before his righteousness, But the hills shall be as a fountain of water, And the righteous shall have rest from the oppression of sinners.'",
        "54:1": "And I looked and turned to another part of the earth, and saw there a deep valley with burning fire.",
        "54:2": "And they brought the kings and the mighty, and began to cast them into this deep valley.",
        "54:3": "And there mine eyes saw how they made these their instruments, iron chains of immeasurable weight.",
        "54:4": "And I asked the angel of peace who went with me, saying: 'For whom are these chains being prepared?'",
        "54:5": "And he said unto me: 'These are being prepared for the hosts of Azâzêl, so that they may take them and cast them into the abyss of complete condemnation, and they shall cover their jaws with rough stones as the Lord of Spirits commanded.",
        "54:6": "And Michael, and Gabriel, and Raphael, and Phanuel shall take hold of them on that great day, and cast them on that day into the burning furnace, that the Lord of Spirits may take vengeance on them for their unrighteousness in becoming subject to Satan and leading astray those who dwell on the earth.'",
        "54:7": "'And in those days shall punishment come from the Lord of Spirits, and he will open all the chambers of waters which are above the heavens, and of the fountains which are beneath the earth.",

        "54:10": "And when they have recognized their unrighteousness which they have wrought on the earth, then by these shall they perish.",
        "55:1": "And after that the Head of Days repented and said: 'In vain have I destroyed all who dwell on the earth.'",
        "55:2": "And He sware by His great name: 'Henceforth I will not do so to all who dwell on the earth, and I will set a sign in the heaven: and this shall be a pledge of good faith between Me and them for ever, so long as heaven is above the earth. And this is in accordance with My command.'",
        "55:3": "When I have desired to take hold of them by the hand of the angels on the day of tribulation and pain because of this, I will cause My chastisement and My wrath to abide upon them, saith God, the Lord of Spirits.",
        "55:4": "Ye †mighty kings† who dwell on the earth, ye shall have to behold Mine Elect One, how he sits on the throne of glory and judges Azâzêl, and all his associates, and all his hosts in the name of the Lord of Spirits.'",
        "56:1": "And I saw there the hosts of the angels of punishment going, and they held scourges and chains of iron and bronze.",
        "56:2": "And I asked the angel of peace who went with me, saying: 'To whom are these who hold the scourges going?'",
        "56:3": "And he said unto me: 'To their elect and beloved ones, that they may be cast into the chasm of the abyss of the valley.",
        "56:4": "And then that valley shall be filled with their elect and beloved, And the days of their lives shall be at an end, And the days of their leading astray shall not thenceforward be reckoned.",
        "56:5": "And in those days the angels shall return And hurl themselves to the east upon the Parthians and Medes: They shall stir up the kings, so that a spirit of unrest shall come upon them, And they shall rouse them from their thrones, That they may break forth as lions from their lairs, And as hungry wolves among their flocks.",
        "56:6": "And they shall go up and tread under foot the land of His elect ones, [And the land of His elect ones shall be before them a threshing-floor and a highway:]",
        "56:7": "But the city of my righteous shall be a hindrance to their horses.\nAnd they shall begin to fight among themselves, And their right hand shall be strong against themselves,\nAnd a man shall not know his brother, Nor a son his father or his mother,\nTill there be no number of the corpses through their slaughter, And their punishment be not in vain.",
        "56:8": "In those days Sheol shall open its jaws, And they shall be swallowed up therein\nAnd their destruction shall be at an end; Sheol shall devour the sinners in the presence of the elect.'",
        "57:1": "And it came to pass after this that I saw another host of wagons, and men riding thereon, and coming on the winds from the east, and from the west to the south.",
        "57:2": "And the noise of their wagons was heard, and when this turmoil took place the holy ones from heaven remarked it, and the pillars of the earth were moved from their place, and the sound thereof was heard from the one end of heaven to the other, in one day.",
        "57:3": "And they shall all fall down and worship the Lord of Spirits. And this is the end of the second Parable.",
        "58:1": "And I began to speak the third Parable concerning the righteous and elect.",

        "58:4": "And they shall seek the light and find righteousness with the Lord of Spirits: There shall be peace to the righteous in the name of the Eternal Lord.",
        "58:5": "And after this it shall be said to the holy in heaven That they should seek out the secrets of righteousness, the heritage of faith: For it has become bright as the sun upon earth, And the darkness is past.",
        "58:6": "And there shall be a light that never endeth, And to a limit (lit. 'number') of days they shall not come, For the darkness shall first have been destroyed, [And the light established before the Lord of Spirits] And the light of uprightness established for ever before the Lord of Spirits.",
        "59:1": "In those days mine eyes saw the secrets of the lightnings, and of the lights, and the judgements they execute (lit. 'their judgement'): and they lighten for a blessing or a curse as the Lord of Spirits willeth.",
        "59:2": "And there I saw the secrets of the thunder, and how when it resounds above in the heaven, the sound thereof is heard, and he caused me to see the judgements executed on the earth, whether they be for well-being and blessing, or for a curse according to the word of the Lord of Spirits.",
        "59:3": "And after that all the secrets of the lights and lightnings were shown to me, and they lighten for blessing and for satisfying.]",
        "60:1": "In the year five hundred, in the seventh month, on the fourteenth day of the month in the life of †Enoch†. In that Parable I saw how a mighty quaking made the heaven of heavens to quake, and the host of the Most High, and the angels, a thousand thousands and ten thousand times ten thousand, were disquieted with a great disquiet.",
        "60:2": "And the Head of Days sat on the throne of His glory, and the angels and the righteous stood around Him.",
        "60:3": "And a great trembling seized me, And fear took hold of me, And my loins gave way, And dissolved were my reins, And I fell upon my face.",
        "60:4": "And Michael sent another angel from among the holy ones and he raised me up, and when he had raised me up my spirit returned; for I had not been able to endure the look of this host, and the commotion and the quaking of the heaven. And Michael said unto me: 'Why art thou disquieted with such a vision? Until this day lasted the day of His mercy; and He hath been merciful and long-suffering towards those who dwell on the earth.",
        "60:6": "And when the day, and the power, and the punishment, and the judgement come, which the Lord of Spirits hath prepared for those who worship not the righteous law, and for those who deny the righteous judgement, and for those who take His name in vain--that day is prepared, for the elect a covenant, but for sinners an inquisition.",
        "60:25": "When the punishment of the Lord of Spirits shall rest upon them, it shall rest in order that the punishment of the Lord of Spirits may not come, in vain, and it shall slay the children with their mothers and the children with their fathers. Afterwards the judgement shall take place according to His mercy and His patience.'",
        "60:7": "And on that day were two monsters parted, a female monster named Leviathan, to dwell in the abysses of the ocean over the fountains of the waters.",
        "60:8": "But the male is named Behemoth, who occupied with his breast a waste wilderness named †Dûidâin†, on the east of the garden where the elect and righteous dwell, where my grandfather was taken up, the seventh from Adam, the first man whom the Lord of Spirits created.",
        "60:9": "And I besought the other angel that he should show me the might of those monsters, how they were parted on one day and cast, the one into the abysses of the sea, and the other unto the dry land of the wilderness.",
        "60:10": "And he said to me: 'Thou son of man, herein thou dost seek to know what is hidden.'",
        "60:11": "And the other angel who went with me and showed me what was hidden told me what is first and last in the heaven in the height, and beneath the earth in the depth, and at the ends of the heaven, and on the foundation of the heaven.",
        "60:12": "And the chambers of the winds, and how the winds are divided, and how they are weighed, and (how) the portals of the winds are reckoned, each according to the power of the wind, and the power of the lights of the moon, and according to the power that is fitting: and the divisions of the stars according to their names, and how all the divisions are divided.",
        "60:13": "And the thunders according to the places where they fall, and all the divisions that are made among the lightnings that it may lighten, and their host that they may at once obey.",
        "60:14": "For the thunder has †places of rest† (which) are assigned (to it) while it is waiting for its peal; and the thunder and lightning are inseparable, and although not one and undivided, they both go together through the spirit and separate not.",
        "60:15": "For when the lightning lightens, the thunder utters its voice, and the spirit enforces a pause during the peal, and divides equally between them; for the treasury of their peals is like the sand, and each one of them as it peals is held in with a bridle, and turned back by the power of the spirit, and pushed forward according to the many quarters of the earth. And the spirit of the sea is masculine and strong, and according to the might of his strength he draws it back with a rein, and in like manner it is driven forward and disperses amid all the mountains of the earth.",
        "60:17": "And the spirit of the hoar-frost is his own angel, and the spirit of the hail is a good angel.",
        "60:18": "And the spirit of the snow has forsaken his chambers on account of his strength--There is a special spirit therein, and that which ascends from it is like smoke, and its name is frost.",
        "60:19": "And the spirit of the mist is not united with them in their chambers, but it has a special chamber; for its course is †glorious† both in light and in darkness, and in winter and in summer, and in its chamber is an angel.",
        "60:20": "And the spirit of the dew has its dwelling at the ends of the heaven, and is connected with the chambers of the rain, and its course is in winter and summer: and its clouds and the clouds of the mist are connected, and the one gives to the other.",
        "60:21": "And when the spirit of the rain goes forth from its chamber, the angels come and open the chamber and lead it out, and when it is diffused over the whole earth it unites with the water on the earth. And whensoever it unites with the water on the earth . . .",
        "60:22": "For the waters are for those who dwell on the earth; for they are nourishment for the earth from the Most High who is in heaven: therefore there is a measure for the rain, and the angels take it in charge.",
        "60:23": "And these things I saw towards the Garden of the Righteous.",
        "60:24": "And the angel of peace who was with me said to me: 'These two monsters, prepared conformably to the greatness of God, shall feed . . .",
        "61:1": "And I saw in those days how long cords were given to those angels, and they took to themselves wings and flew, and they went towards the north.",
        "61:2": "And I asked the angel, saying unto him: 'Why have those (angels) taken these cords and gone off?' And he said unto me: 'They have gone to measure.'",
        "61:3": "And the angel who went with me said unto me: 'These shall bring the measures of the righteous, And the ropes of the righteous to the righteous, That they may stay themselves on the name of the Lord of Spirits for ever and ever.",
        "61:4": "The elect shall begin to dwell with the elect, And those are the measures which shall be given to faith And which shall strengthen righteousness.",
        "61:5": "And these measures shall reveal all the secrets of the depths of the earth, And those who have been destroyed by the desert, And those who have been devoured by the beasts, And those who have been devoured by the fish of the sea,\nThat they may return and stay themselves On the day of the Elect One; For none shall be destroyed before the Lord of Spirits, And none can be destroyed.",
        "61:6": "And all who dwell above in the heaven received a command and power and one voice and one light like unto fire.",
        "61:7": "And that One (with) their first words they blessed, And extolled and lauded with wisdom, And they were wise in utterance and in the spirit of life.",
        "61:8": "And the Lord of Spirits placed the Elect one on the throne of glory. And he shall judge all the works of the holy above in the heaven, And in the balance shall their deeds be weighed",
        "61:9": "And when he shall lift up his countenance To judge their secret ways according to the word of the name of the Lord of Spirits, And their path according to the way of the righteous judgement of the Lord of Spirits, Then shall they all with one voice speak and bless, And glorify and extol and sanctify the name of the Lord of Spirits.",
        "61:10": "And He will summon all the host of the heavens, and all the holy ones above, and the host of God, the Cherubic, Seraphin and Ophannin, and all the angels of power, and all the angels of principalities, and the Elect One, and the other powers on the earth (and) over the water.",
        "61:11": "On that day shall raise one voice, and bless and glorify and exalt in the spirit of faith, and in the spirit of wisdom, and in the spirit of patience, and in the spirit of mercy, and in the spirit of judgement and of peace, and in the spirit of goodness, and shall all say with one voice: \"Blessed is He, and may the name of the Lord of Spirits be blessed for ever and ever.\"",
        "61:12": "All who sleep not above in heaven shall bless Him: All the holy ones who are in heaven shall bless Him, And all the elect who dwell in the garden of life:\nAnd every spirit of light who is able to bless, and glorify, and extol, and hallow Thy blessed name, And all flesh shall beyond measure glorify and bless Thy name for ever and ever.",
        "61:13": "For great is the mercy of the Lord of Spirits, and He is long-suffering, And all His works and all that He has created He has revealed to the righteous and elect In the name of the Lord of Spirits.",
        "62:1": "And thus the Lord commanded the kings and the mighty and the exalted, and those who dwell on the earth, and said: 'Open your eyes and lift up your horns if ye are able to recognize the Elect One.'",
        "62:2": "And the Lord of Spirits seated him on the throne of His glory, And the spirit of righteousness was poured out upon him, And the word of his mouth slays all the sinners, And all the unrighteous are destroyed from before his face.",
        "62:3": "And there shall stand up in that day all the kings and the mighty, And the exalted and those who hold the earth, And they shall see and recognize How he sits on the throne of his glory, And righteousness is judged before him, And no lying word is spoken before him.",
        "62:4": "Then shall pain come upon them as on a woman in travail, [And she has pain in bringing forth] When her child enters the mouth of the womb, And she has pain in bringing forth.",
        "62:5": "And one portion of them shall look on the other, And they shall be terrified, And they shall be downcast of countenance, And pain shall seize them, When they see that Son of Man Sitting on the throne of his glory.",
        "62:6": "And the kings and the mighty and all who possess the earth shall bless and glorify and extol him who rules over all, who was hidden.",
        "62:7": "For from the beginning the Son of Man was hidden, And the Most High preserved him in the presence of His might, And revealed him to the elect.",
        "62:8": "And the congregation of the elect and holy shall be sown, And all the elect shall stand before him on that day.",
        "62:9": "And all the kings and the mighty and the exalted and those who rule the earth Shall fall down before him on their faces, And worship and set their hope upon that Son of Man, And petition him and supplicate for mercy at his hands.",
        "62:10": "Nevertheless that Lord of Spirits will so press them That they shall hastily go forth from His presence, And their faces shall be filled with shame, And the darkness grow deeper on their faces.",
        "62:11": "And He will deliver them to the angels for punishment, To execute vengeance on them because they have oppressed His children and His elect",
        "62:12": "And they shall be a spectacle for the righteous and for His elect: They shall rejoice over them, Because the wrath of the Lord of Spirits resteth upon them, And His sword is drunk with their blood.",
        "62:13": "And the righteous and elect shall be saved on that day, And they shall never thenceforward see the face of the sinners and unrighteous.",
        "62:14": "And the Lord of Spirits will abide over them, And with that Son of Man shall they eat And lie down and rise up for ever and ever.",

        "63:1": "In those days shall the mighty and the kings who possess the earth implore (Him) to grant them a little respite from His angels of punishment to whom they were delivered, that they might fall down and worship before the Lord of Spirits, and confess their sins before Him.",
        "63:2": "And they shall bless and glorify the Lord of Spirits, and say: \n'Blessed is the Lord of Spirits and the Lord of kings, And the Lord of the mighty and the Lord of the rich, And the Lord of glory and the Lord of wisdom,",
        "63:3": "And splendid in every secret thing is Thy power from generation to generation, And Thy glory for ever and ever:\nDeep are all Thy secrets and innumerable, And Thy righteousness is beyond reckoning.",
        "63:4": "We have now learnt that we should glorify And bless the Lord of kings and Him who is king over all kings.'",
        "63:5": "And they shall say: 'Would that we had rest to glorify and give thanks And confess our faith before His glory!",
        "63:6": "And now we long for a little rest but find it not: We follow hard upon and obtain (it) not:\nAnd light has vanished from before us, And darkness is our dwelling-place for ever and ever:",
        "63:7": "For we have not believed before Him Nor glorified the name of the Lord of Spirits, [nor glorified our Lord]\nBut our hope was in the sceptre of our kingdom, And in our glory.",
        "63:8": "And in the day of our suffering and tribulation He saves us not, And we find no respite for confession\nThat our Lord is true in all His works, and in His judgements and His justice, And His judgements have no respect of persons.",
        "63:9": "And we pass away from before His face on account of our works, And all our sins are reckoned up in righteousness.'",
        "63:10": "Now they shall say unto themselves: 'Our souls are full of unrighteous gain, but it does not prevent us from descending from the midst thereof into the †burden† of Sheol.'",
        "63:11": "And after that their faces shall be filled with darkness And shame before that Son of Man, And they shall be driven from his presence, And the sword shall abide before his face in their midst.",
        "63:12": "Thus spake the Lord of Spirits: 'This is the ordinance and judgement with respect to the mighty and the kings and the exalted and those who possess the earth before the Lord of Spirits.'",
        "64:1": "And other forms I saw hidden in that place.",
        "64:2": "I heard the voice of the angel saying: 'These are the angels who descended to the earth, and revealed what was hidden to the children of men and seduced the children of men into committing sin.'",
        "65:1": "And in those days Noah saw the earth that it had sunk down and its destruction was nigh.",
        "65:2": "And he arose from thence and went to the ends of the earth, and cried aloud to his grandfather Enoch: and Noah said three times with an embittered voice: Hear me, hear me, hear me.'",
        "65:3": "And I said unto him: 'Tell me what it is that is falling out on the earth that the earth is in such evil plight and shaken, lest perchance I shall perish with it?'",
        "65:4": "And thereupon there was a great commotion, on the earth, and a voice was heard from heaven, and I fell on my face.",
        "65:5": "And Enoch my grandfather came and stood by me, and said unto me: 'Why hast thou cried unto me with a bitter cry and weeping?",
        "65:6": "And a command has gone forth from the presence of the Lord concerning those who dwell on the earth that their ruin is accomplished because they have learnt all the secrets of the angels, and all the violence of the Satans, and all their powers--the most secret ones--and all the power of those who practice sorcery, and the power of witchcraft, and the power of those who make molten images for the whole earth:",
        "65:7": "And how silver is produced from the dust of the earth, and how soft metal originates in the earth.",
        "65:8": "For lead and tin are not produced from the earth like the first: it is a fountain that produces them, and an angel stands therein, and that angel is pre-eminent.'",
        "65:9": "And after that my grandfather Enoch took hold of me by my hand and raised me up, and said unto me: 'Go, for I have asked the Lord of Spirits as touching this commotion on the earth.",
        "65:10": "And He said unto me: \"Because of their unrighteousness their judgement has been determined upon and shall not be withheld by Me for ever. Because of the sorceries which they have searched out and learnt, the earth and those who dwell upon it shall be destroyed.\"",
        "65:11": "And these--they have no place of repentance for ever, because they have shown them what was hidden, and they are the damned: but as for thee, my son, the Lord of Spirits knows that thou art pure, and guiltless of this reproach concerning the secrets.",
        "65:12": "And He has destined thy name to be among the holy, And will preserve thee amongst those who dwell on the earth, And has destined thy righteous seed both for kingship and for great honours, And from thy seed shall proceed a fountain of the righteous and holy without number for ever.",
        "66:1": "And after that he showed me the angels of punishment who are prepared to come and let loose all the powers of the waters which are beneath in the earth in order to bring judgement and destruction on all who [abide and] dwell on the earth.",
        "66:2": "And the Lord of Spirits gave commandment to the angels who were going forth, that they should not cause the waters to rise but should hold them in check; for those angels were over the powers of the waters.",
        "66:3": "And I went away from the presence of Enoch.",
        "67:1": "And in those days the word of God came unto me, and He said unto me: 'Noah, thy lot has come up before Me, a lot without blame, a lot of love and uprightness.",
        "67:2": "And now the angels are making a wooden (building), and when they have completed that task I will place My hand upon it and preserve it, and there shall come forth from it the seed of life, and a change shall set in so that the earth will not remain without inhabitant.",
        "67:3": "And I will make fast thy seed before me for ever and ever, and I will spread abroad those who dwell with thee: it shall not be unfruitful on the face of the earth, but it shall be blessed and multiply on the earth in the name of the Lord.'",
        "67:4": "And He will imprison those angels, who have shown unrighteousness, in that burning valley which my grandfather Enoch had formerly shown to me in the west among the mountains of gold and silver and iron and soft metal and tin.",
        "67:5": "And I saw that valley in which there was a great convulsion and a convulsion of the waters.",
        "67:6": "And when all this took place, from that fiery molten metal and from the convulsion thereof in that place, there was produced a smell of sulphur, and it was connected with those waters, and that valley of the angels who had led astray (mankind) burned beneath that land.",
        "67:7": "And through its valleys proceed streams of fire, where these angels are punished who had led astray those who dwell upon the earth.",
        "67:8": "But those waters shall in those days serve for the kings and the mighty and the exalted, and those who dwell on the earth, for the healing of the body, but for the punishment of the spirit; now their spirit is full of lust, that they may be punished in their body, for they have denied the Lord of Spirits and see their punishment daily, and yet believe not in His name.",
        "67:9": "And in proportion as the burning of their bodies becomes severe, a corresponding change shall take place in their spirit for ever and ever; for before the Lord of Spirits none shall utter an idle word.",
        "67:10": "For the judgement shall come upon them, because they believe in the lust of their body and deny the Spirit of the Lord.",
        "67:11": "And those same waters will undergo a change in those days; for when those angels are punished in these waters, these water-springs shall change their temperature, and when the angels ascend, this water of the springs shall change and become cold.",
        "67:12": "And I heard Michael answering and saying: 'This judgement wherewith the angels are judged is a testimony for the kings and the mighty who possess the earth.'",
        "67:13": "Because these waters of judgement minister to the healing of the body of the kings and the lust of their body; therefore they will not see and will not believe that those waters will change and become a fire which burns for ever.",
        "68:1": "And after that my grandfather Enoch gave me the teaching of all the secrets in the book in the Parables which had been given to him, and he put them together for me in the words of the book of the Parables.",
        "68:2": "And on that day Michael answered Raphael and said: 'The power of the spirit transports and makes me to tremble because of the severity of the judgement of the secrets, the judgement of the angels: who can endure the severe judgement which has been executed, and before which they melt away?'",
        "68:3": "And Michael answered again, and said to Raphael: 'Who is he whose heart is not softened concerning it, and whose reins are not troubled by this word of judgement (that) has gone forth upon them because of those who have thus led them out?'",
        "68:4": "And it came to pass when he stood before the Lord of Spirits, Michael said thus to Raphael: 'I will not take their part under the eye of the Lord; for the Lord of Spirits has been angry with them because they do as if they were the Lord. Therefore all that is hidden shall come upon them for ever and ever; for neither angel nor man shall have his portion (in it), but alone they have received their judgement for ever and ever.'",
        "69:1": "And after this judgement they shall terrify and make them to tremble because they have shown this to those who dwell on the earth.",
        "69:2": "And behold the names of those angels [and these are their names: the first of them is Samjâzâ, the second Artâqîfâ, and the third Armên, the fourth Kôkabêl, the fifth †Tûrâêl†, the sixth Rûmjâl, the seventh Dânjâl, the eighth †Nêqâêl†, the ninth Barâqêl, the tenth Azâzêl, the eleventh Armârôs, the twelfth Batarjâl, the thirteenth †Busasêjal†, the fourteenth Hanânêl, the fifteenth †Tûrêl†, and the sixteenth Sîmâpêsîêl, the seventeenth Jetrêl, the eighteenth Tûmâêl, the nineteenth Tûrêl, the twentieth †Rumâêl†, the twenty-first †Azâzêl†.",

        "69:6": "And the third was named Gâdreêl: he it is who showed the children of men all the blows of death, and he led astray Eve, and showed ⌈the weapons of death to the sons of men⌉ the shield and the coat of mail, and the sword for battle, and all the weapons of death to the children of men.",
        "69:7": "And from his hand they have proceeded against those who dwell on the earth from that day and for evermore.",
        "69:8": "And the fourth was named Pênêmûe: he taught the children of men the bitter and the sweet, and he taught them all the secrets of their wisdom.",
        "69:9": "And he instructed mankind in writing with ink and paper, and thereby many sinned from eternity to eternity and until this day.",
        "69:10": "For men were not created for such a purpose, to give confirmation to their good faith with pen and ink.",
        "69:11": "For men were created exactly like the angels, to the intent that they should continue pure and righteous, and death, which destroys everything, could not have taken hold of them, but through this their knowledge they are perishing, and through this power it is consuming me†.",
        "69:12": "And the fifth was named Kâsdejâ: this is he who showed the children of men all the wicked smitings of spirits and demons, and the smitings of the embryo in the womb, that it may pass away, and [the smitings of the soul] the bites of the serpent, and the smitings which befall through the noontide heat, the son of the serpent named Tabââĕt.",

        "72:28": "And on that night has the night decreased in length by a †ninth† part, and the night has become eleven parts and the day seven parts.",
        "72:29": "And the sun has returned and entered into the second portal in the east, and returns on those his divisions of his orbit for thirty mornings, rising and setting.",
        "72:30": "And on that day the night decreases in length, and the night amounts to ten parts and the day to eight.",
        "72:31": "And on that day the sun rises from that portal, and sets in the west, and returns to the east, and rises in the third portal for one-and-thirty mornings, and sets in the west of the heaven.",
        "72:32": "On that day the night decreases and amounts to nine parts, and the day to nine parts, and the night is equal to the day and the year is exactly as to its days three hundred and sixty-four.",
        "72:33": "And the length of the day and of the night, and the shortness of the day and of the night arise--through the course of the sun these distinctions are made (lit. 'they are separated').",
        "72:34": "So it comes that its course becomes daily longer, and its course nightly shorter.",
        "72:35": "And this is the law and the course of the sun, and his return as often as he returns sixty times and rises, i.e. the great luminary which is named the sun, for ever and ever.",
        "72:36": "And that which (thus) rises is the great luminary, and is so named according to its appearance, according as the Lord commanded.",
        "72:37": "As he rises, so he sets and decreases not, and rests not, but runs day and night, and his light is sevenfold brighter than that of the moon; but as regards size they are both equal.",
        "73:1": "And after this law I saw another law dealing with the smaller luminary, which is named the Moon.",
        "73:2": "And her circumference is like the circumference of the heaven, and her chariot in which she rides is driven by the wind, and light is given to her in (definite) measure.",
        "73:3": "And her rising and setting change every month: and her days are like the days of the sun, and when her light is uniform (i.e. full) it amounts to the seventh part of the light of the sun.",
        "73:4": "And thus she rises. And her first phase in the east comes forth on the thirtieth morning: and on that day she becomes visible, and constitutes for you the first phase of the moon on the thirtieth day together with the sun in the portal where the sun rises.",
        "73:5": "And the one half of her goes forth by a seventh part, and her whole circumference is empty, without light, with the exception of one-seventh part of it, (and) the fourteenth part of her light.",
        "73:6": "And when she receives one-seventh part of the half of her light, her light amounts to one-seventh part and the half thereof.",
        "73:7": "And she sets with the sun, and when the sun rises the moon rises with him and receives the half of one part of light, and in that night in the beginning of her morning [in the commencement of the lunar day] the moon sets with the sun, and is invisible that night with the fourteen parts and the half of one of them.",
        "73:8": "And she rises on that day with exactly a seventh part, and comes forth and recedes from the rising of the sun, and in her remaining days she becomes bright in the (remaining) thirteen parts.",
        "74:1": "And I saw another course, a law for her, (and) how according to that law she performs her monthly revolution.",
        "74:2": "And all these Uriel, the holy angel who is the leader of them all, showed to me, and their positions, and I wrote down their positions as he showed them to me, and I wrote down their months as they were, and the appearance of their lights till fifteen days were accomplished.",
        "74:3": "In single seventh parts she accomplishes all her light in the east, and in single seventh parts accomplishes all her darkness in the west.",
        "74:4": "And in certain months she alters her settings, and in certain months she pursues her own peculiar course.",
        "74:5": "years 1820 days, so that in 8 years there are 2912 days.",
        "74:6": "days every year come to",
        "74:7": "And when the sun goes forth from the fourth portal she goes forth seven days, until she goes forth from the fifth and turns back again in seven days into the fourth portal and accomplishes all her light: and she recedes and enters into the first portal in eight days.",
        "74:8": "And she returns again in seven days into the fourth portal from which the sun goes forth.",
        "74:9": "Thus I saw their position--how the moons rose and the sun set in those days.",
        "74:10": "And if five years are added together the sun has an overplus of thirty days, and all the days which accrue to it for one of those five years, when they are full, amount to 364 days.",
        "74:11": "And the overplus of the sun and of the stars amounts to six days: in",
        "74:30": "days: and the moon falls behind the sun and stars to the number of 30 days.",
        "74:12": "And the sun and the stars bring in all the years exactly, so that they do not advance or delay their position by a single day unto eternity; but complete the years with perfect justice in 364 days.",
        "74:13": "In 3 years there are 1092 days, and in",
        "74:14": "For the moon alone the days amount in 3 years to 1062 days, and in 5 years she falls 50 days behind: [i.e. to the sum (of 1770) there is to be added (1000 and) 62 days.]",
        "74:15": "And in 5 years there are 1770 days, so that for the moon the days in 8 years amount to 2832 days.",
        "74:16": "[For in 8 years she falls behind to the amount of 80 days], all the days she falls behind in 8 years are 80",
        "74:17": "And the year is accurately completed in conformity with their world-stations and the stations of the sun, which rise from the portals through which it (the sun) rises and sets 30 days.",
        "75:1": "And the leaders of the heads of the thousands, who are placed over the whole creation and over all the stars, have also to do with the four intercalary days, being inseparable from their office, according to the reckoning of the year, and these render service on the four days which are not reckoned in the reckoning of the year.",
        "75:2": "And owing to them men go wrong therein, for those luminaries truly render service on the world-stations, one in the first portal, one in the third portal of the heaven, one in the fourth portal, and one in the sixth portal, and the exactness of the year is accomplished through its separate three hundred and sixty-four stations.",
        "75:3": "For the signs and the times and the years and the days the angel Uriel showed to me, whom the Lord of glory hath set for ever over all the luminaries of the heaven, in the heaven and in the world, that they should rule on the face of the heaven and be seen on the earth, and be leaders for the day and the night, i.e. the sun, moon, and stars, and all the ministering creatures which make their revolution in all the chariots of the heaven.",
        "75:4": "In like manner twelve doors Uriel showed me, open in the circumference of the sun's chariot in the heaven, through which the rays of the sun break forth: and from them is warmth diffused over the earth, when they are opened at their appointed seasons.",
        "75:5": "[And for the winds and the spirit of the dew† when they are opened, standing open in the heavens at the ends.]",
        "75:6": "As for the twelve portals in the heaven, at the ends of the earth, out of which go forth the sun, moon, and stars, and all the works of heaven in the east and in the west.",
        "75:7": "There are many windows open to the left and right of them, and one window at its (appointed) season produces warmth, corresponding (as these do) to those doors from which the stars come forth according as He has commanded them, and wherein they set corresponding to their number.",
        "75:8": "And I saw chariots in the heaven, running in the world, above those portals in which revolve the stars that never set.",
        "75:9": "And one is larger than all the rest, and it is that that makes its course through the entire world.",
        "76:1": "And at the ends of the earth I saw twelve portals open to all the quarters (of the heaven), from which the winds go forth and blow over the earth.",
        "76:2": "Three of them are open on the face (i.e. the east) of the heavens, and three in the west, and three on the right (i.e. the south) of the heaven, and three on the left (i.e. the north).",
        "76:3": "And the three first are those of the east, and three are of †the north, and three [after those on the left] of the south†, and three of the west.",
        "76:4": "Through four of these come winds of blessing and prosperity, and from those eight come hurtful winds: when they are sent, they bring destruction on all the earth and on the water upon it, and on all who dwell thereon, and on everything which is in the water and on the land.",
        "76:5": "And the first wind from those portals, called the east wind, comes forth through the first portal which is in the east, inclining towards the south: from it come forth desolation, drought, heat, and destruction.",
        "76:6": "And through the second portal in the middle comes what is fitting, and from it there come rain and fruitfulness and prosperity and dew; and through the third portal which lies toward the north come cold and drought.",
        "76:7": "And after these come forth the south winds through three portals: through the first portal of them inclining to the east comes forth a hot wind.",
        "76:8": "And through the middle portal next to it there come forth fragrant smells, and dew and rain, and prosperity and health.",
        "76:9": "And through the third portal lying to the west come forth dew and rain, locusts and desolation.",
        "76:10": "And after these the north winds: from the seventh portal in the east come dew and rain, locusts and desolation.",
        "76:11": "And from the middle portal come in a direct direction health and rain and dew and prosperity; and through the third portal in the west come cloud and hoar-frost, and snow and rain, and dew and locusts.",
        "76:12": "And after these [four] are the west winds: through the first portal adjoining the north come forth dew and hoar-frost, and cold and snow and frost. And from the middle portal come forth dew and rain, and prosperity and blessing; and through the last portal which adjoins the south come forth drought and desolation, and burning and destruction.",
        "76:14": "And the twelve portals of the four quarters of the heaven are therewith completed, and all their laws and all their plagues and all their benefactions have I shown to thee, my son Methuselah.",
        "77:1": "And the first quarter is called the east, because it is the first: and the second, the south, because the Most High will descend there, yea, there in quite a special sense will He who is blessed for ever descend.",
        "77:2": "And the west quarter is named the diminished, because there all the luminaries of the heaven wane and go down.",
        "77:3": "And the fourth quarter, named the north, is divided into three parts: the first of them is for the dwelling of men: and the second contains seas of water, and the abysses and forests and rivers, and darkness and clouds; and the third part contains the garden of righteousness.",
        "77:4": "I saw seven high mountains, higher than all the mountains which are on the earth: and thence comes forth hoar-frost, and days, seasons, and years pass away.",
        "77:5": "I saw seven rivers on the earth larger than all the rivers: one of them coming from the west pours its waters into the Great Sea.",
        "77:6": "And these two come from the north to the sea and pour their waters into the Erythraean Sea in the east.",
        "77:7": "And the remaining four come forth on the side of the north to their own sea, 〈two of them〉 to the Erythraean Sea, and two into the Great Sea and discharge themselves there [and some say: into the desert].",
        "77:8": "Seven great islands I saw in the sea and in the mainland: two in the mainland and five in the Great Sea.",
        "78:1": "And the names of the sun are the following: the first Orjârês, and the second Tômâs.",
        "78:2": "And the moon has four names: the first name is Asônjâ, the second Eblâ, the third Benâsê, and the fourth Erâe.",
        "78:3": "These are the two great luminaries: their circumference is like the circumference of the heaven, and the size of the circumference of both is alike.",
        "78:4": "In the circumference of the sun there are seven portions of light which are added to it more than to the moon, and in definite measures it is s transferred till the seventh portion of the sun is exhausted.",
        "78:5": "And they set and enter the portals of the west, and make their revolution by the north, and come forth through the eastern portals on the face of the heaven.",
        "78:6": "And when the moon rises one-fourteenth part appears in the heaven: ⌈the light becomes full in her⌉: on the fourteenth day she accomplishes her light.",
        "78:7": "And fifteen parts of light are transferred to her till the fifteenth day (when) her light is accomplished, according to the sign of the year, and she becomes fifteen parts, and the moon grows by (the addition of) fourteenth parts.",
        "78:8": "And in her waning (the moon) decreases on the first day to fourteen parts of her light, on the second to thirteen parts of light, on the third to twelve, on the fourth to eleven, on the fifth to ten, on the sixth to nine, on the seventh to eight, on the eighth to seven, on the ninth to six, on the tenth to five, on the eleventh to four, on the twelfth to three, on the thirteenth to two, on the fourteenth to the half of a seventh, and all her remaining light disappears wholly on the fifteenth.",
        "78:9": "And in certain months the month has twenty-nine days and once twenty-eight.",
        "78:10": "And Uriel showed me another law: when light is transferred to the moon, and on which side it is transferred to her by the sun.",
        "78:11": "During all the period during which the moon is growing in her light, she is transferring it to herself when opposite to the sun during fourteen days [her light is accomplished in the heaven], and when she is illumined throughout, her light is accomplished full in the heaven.",
        "78:12": "And on the first day she is called the new moon, for on that day the light rises upon her.",
        "78:13": "She becomes full moon exactly on the day when the sun sets in the west, and from the east she rises at night, and the moon shines the whole night through till the sun rises over against her and the moon is seen over against the sun.",
        "78:14": "On the side whence the light of the moon comes forth, there again she wanes till all the light vanishes and all the days of the month are at an end, and her circumference is empty, void of light.",
        "78:15": "And three months she makes of thirty days, and at her time she makes three months of twenty-nine days each, in which she accomplishes her waning in the first period of time, and in the first portal for one hundred and seventy-seven days.",
        "78:16": "And in the time of her going out she appears for three months (of) thirty days each, and for three months she appears (of) twenty-nine each.",
        "78:17": "At night she appears like a man for twenty days each time, and by day she appears like the heaven, and there is nothing else in her save her light.",
        "79:1": "And now, my son, I have shown thee everything, and the law of all the stars of the heaven is completed.",
        "79:2": "And he showed me all the laws of these for every day, and for every season of bearing rule, and for every year, and for its going forth, and for the order prescribed to it every month and every week:",
        "79:3": "And the waning of the moon which takes place in the sixth portal: for in this sixth portal her light is accomplished, and after that there is the beginning of the waning:",
        "79:4": "〈And the waning〉 which takes place in the first portal in its season, till one hundred and seventy-seven days are accomplished: reckoned according to weeks, twenty-five (weeks) and two days.",
        "79:5": "She falls behind the sun and the order of the stars exactly five days in the course of one period, and when this place which thou seest has been traversed.",
        "79:6": "Such is the picture and sketch of every luminary which Uriel the archangel, who is their leader, showed unto me.",
        "80:1": "And in those days the angel Uriel answered and said to me: 'Behold, I have shown thee everything, Enoch, and I have revealed everything to thee that thou shouldst see this sun and this moon, and the leaders of the stars of the heaven and all those who turn them, their tasks and times and departures.",
        "80:2": "And in the days of the sinners the years shall be shortened, And their seed shall be tardy on their lands and fields, And all things on the earth shall alter, And shall not appear in their time: And the rain shall be kept back And the heaven shall withhold (it).",
        "80:3": "And in those times the fruits of the earth shall be backward, And shall not grow in their time, And the fruits of the trees shall be withheld in their time.",
        "80:4": "And the moon shall alter her order, And not appear at her time.",
        "80:5": "[And in those days the sun shall be seen and he shall journey in the evening †on the extremity of the great chariot† in the west] And shall shine more brightly than accords with the order of light.",
        "80:6": "And many chiefs of the stars shall transgress the order (prescribed). And these shall alter their orbits and tasks, And not appear at the seasons prescribed to them.",
        "80:7": "And the whole order of the stars shall be concealed from the sinners, And the thoughts of those on the earth shall err concerning them, [And they shall be altered from all their ways], Yea, they shall err and take them to be gods.",
        "80:8": "And evil shall be multiplied upon them, And punishment shall come upon them So as to destroy all.'",
        "81:1": "And he said unto me: 'Observe, Enoch, these heavenly tablets, And read what is written thereon, And mark every individual fact.'",
        "81:2": "And I observed the heavenly tablets, and read everything which was written (thereon) and understood everything, and read the book of all the deeds of mankind, and of all the children of flesh that shall be upon the earth to the remotest generations.",
        "81:3": "And forthwith I blessed the great Lord the King of glory for ever, in that He has made all the works of the world, \nAnd I extolled the Lord because of His patience, And blessed Him because of the children of men.",
        "81:4": "And after that I said: 'Blessed is the man who dies in righteousness and goodness, Concerning whom there is no book of unrighteousness written, And against whom no day of judgement shall be found.'",
        "81:5": "And those seven holy ones brought me and placed me on the earth before the door of my house, and said to me: 'Declare everything to thy son Methuselah, and show to all thy children that no flesh is righteous in the sight of the Lord, for He is their Creator.",
        "81:6": "One year we will leave thee with thy son, till thou givest thy (last) commands, that thou mayest teach thy children and record (it) for them, and testify to all thy children; and in the second year they shall take thee from their midst.",
        "81:7": "Let thy heart be strong, For the good shall announce righteousness to the good;\nThe righteous with the righteous shall rejoice, And shall offer congratulation to one another.",
        "81:8": "But the sinners shall die with the sinners, And the apostate go down with the apostate.",
        "81:9": "And those who practice righteousness shall die on account of the deeds of men, And be taken away on account of the doings of the godless.'",
        "81:10": "And in those days they ceased to speak to me, and I came to my people, blessing the Lord of the world.",
        "82:1": "And now, my son Methuselah, all these things I am recounting to thee and writing down for thee, and I have revealed to thee everything, and given thee books concerning all these: so preserve, my son Methuselah, the books from thy father's hand, and (see) that thou deliver them to the generations of the world.",
        "82:2": "I have given Wisdom to thee and to thy children, [And thy children that shall be to thee], That they may give it to their children for generations, This wisdom (namely) that passeth their thought.",
        "82:3": "And those who understand it shall not sleep, But shall listen with the ear that they may learn this wisdom, And it shall please those that eat thereof better than good food.",
        "82:4": "Blessed are all the righteous, blessed are all those who walk in the way of righteousness and sin not as the sinners, in the reckoning of all their days in which the sun traverses the heaven, entering into and departing from the portals for thirty days with the heads of thousands of the order of the stars, together with the four which are intercalated which divide the four portions of the year, which lead them and enter with them four days.",
        "82:5": "Owing to them men shall be at fault and not reckon them in the whole reckoning of the year: yea, men shall be at fault, and not recognize them accurately.",
        "82:6": "For they belong to the reckoning of the year and are truly recorded (thereon) for ever, one in the first portal and one in the third, and one in the fourth and one in the sixth, and the year is completed in three hundred and sixty-four days.",
        "82:7": "And the account thereof is accurate and the recorded reckoning thereof exact; for the luminaries, and months and festivals, and years and days, has Uriel shown and revealed to me, to whom the Lord of the whole creation of the world hath subjected the host of heaven.",
        "82:8": "And he has power over night and day in the heaven to cause the light to give light to men--sun, moon, and stars, and all the powers of the heaven which revolve in their circular chariots.",
        "82:9": "And these are the orders of the stars, which set in their places, and in their seasons and festivals and months.",
        "82:10": "And these are the names of those who lead them, who watch that they enter at their times, in their orders, in their seasons, in their months, in their periods of dominion, and in their positions.",
        "82:11": "Their four leaders who divide the four parts of the year enter first; and after them the twelve leaders of the orders who divide the months; and for the three hundred and sixty (days) there are heads over thousands who divide the days; and for the four intercalary days there are the leaders which sunder the four parts of the year.",
        "82:12": "And these heads over thousands are intercalated between leader and leader, each behind a station, but their leaders make the division. And these are the names of the leaders who divide the four parts of the year which are ordained: Mîlkî'êl, Hel'emmêlêk, and Mêl'êjal, and Nârêl.",
        "82:13": "And the names of those who lead them: Adnâr'êl, and Îjâsûsa'êl, and 'Elômê'êl--these three follow the leaders of the orders, and there is one that follows the three leaders of the orders which follow those leaders of stations that divide the four parts of the year.",
        "82:15": "In the beginning of the year Melkejâl rises first and rules, who is named †Tam'âinî† and sun, and all the days of his dominion whilst he bears rule are ninety-one days.",
        "82:16": "And these are the signs of the days which are to be seen on earth in the days of his dominion: sweat, and heat, and calms; and all the trees bear fruit, and leaves are produced on all the trees, and the harvest of wheat, and the rose-flowers, and all the flowers which come forth in the field, but the trees of the winter season become withered.",
        "82:17": "And these are the names of the leaders which are under them: Berka'êl, Zêlebs'êl, and another who is added a head of a thousand, called Hîlûjâsĕph: and the days of the dominion of this (leader) are at an end.",
        "82:18": "The next leader after him is Hêl'emmêlêk, whom one names the shining sun, and all the days of his light are ninety-one days.",
        "82:19": "And these are the signs of (his) days on the earth: glowing heat and dryness, and the trees ripen their fruits and produce all their fruits ripe and ready, and the sheep pair and become pregnant, and all the fruits of the earth are gathered in, and everything that is in the fields, and the winepress: these things take place in the days of his dominion.",
        "82:20": "These are the names, and the orders, and the leaders of those heads of thousands: Gîdâ'îjal, Kê'êl, and Hê'êl, and the name of the head of a thousand which is added to them, Asfâ'êl': and the days of his dominion are at an end.",
        "83:1": "And now, my son Methuselah, I will show thee all my visions which I have seen, recounting them before thee.",
        "83:2": "Two visions I saw before I took a wife, and the one was quite unlike the other: the first when I was learning to write: the second before I took thy mother, (when) I saw a terrible vision. And regarding them I prayed to the Lord.",
        "83:3": "I had laid me down in the house of my grandfather Mahalalel, (when) I saw in a vision how the heaven collapsed and was borne off and fell to the earth.",
        "83:4": "And when it fell to the earth I saw how the earth was swallowed up in a great abyss, and mountains were suspended on mountains, and hills sank down on hills, and high trees were rent from their stems, and hurled down and sunk in the abyss.",
        "83:5": "And thereupon a word fell into my mouth, and I lifted up (my voice) to cry aloud, and said: 'The earth is destroyed.'",
        "83:6": "And my grandfather Mahalalel waked me as I lay near him, and said unto me: 'Why dost thou cry so, my son, and why dost thou make such lamentation?'",
        "83:7": "And I recounted to him the whole vision which I had seen, and he said unto me: 'A terrible thing hast thou seen, my son, and of grave moment is thy dream-vision as to the secrets of all the sin of the earth: it must sink into the abyss and be destroyed with a great destruction.",
        "83:8": "And now, my son, arise and make petition to the Lord of glory, since thou art a believer, that a remnant may remain on the earth, and that He may not destroy the whole earth.",
        "83:9": "My son, from heaven all this will come upon the earth, and upon the earth there will be great destruction.",
        "83:10": "After that I arose and prayed and implored and besought, and wrote down my prayer for the generations of the world, and I will show everything to thee, my son Methuselah.",
        "83:11": "And when I had gone forth below and seen the heaven, and the sun rising in the east, and the moon setting in the west, and a few stars, and the whole earth, and everything as †He had known† it in the beginning, then I blessed the Lord of judgement and extolled Him because He had made the sun to go forth from the windows of the east, †and he ascended and rose on the face of the heaven, and set out and kept traversing the path shown unto him.",
        "84:1": "And I lifted up my hands in righteousness and blessed the Holy and Great One, and spake with the breath of my mouth, and with the tongue of flesh, which God has made for the children of the flesh of men, that they should speak therewith, and He gave them breath and a tongue and a mouth that they should speak therewith:",
        "84:2": "'Blessed be Thou, O Lord, King, Great and mighty in Thy greatness, Lord of the whole creation of the heaven, King of kings and God of the whole world.\nAnd Thy power and kingship and greatness abide for ever and ever, And throughout all generations Thy dominion; And all the heavens are Thy throne for ever, And the whole earth Thy footstool for ever and ever.",
        "84:3": "For Thou hast made and Thou rulest all things, And nothing is too hard for Thee, Wisdom departs not from the place of Thy throne, Nor turns away from Thy presence. And Thou knowest and seest and hearest everything, And there is nothing hidden from Thee [for Thou seest everything].",
        "84:4": "And now the angels of Thy heavens are guilty of trespass, And upon the flesh of men abideth Thy wrath until the great day of judgement.",
        "84:5": "And now, O God and Lord and Great King, I implore and beseech Thee to fulfil my prayer, To leave me a posterity on earth, And not destroy all the flesh of man, And make the earth without inhabitant, So that there should be an eternal destruction.",
        "84:6": "And now, my Lord, destroy from the earth the flesh which has aroused Thy wrath, But the flesh of righteousness and uprightness establish as a plant of the eternal seed, And hide not Thy face from the prayer of Thy servant, O Lord.'",
        "85:1": "And after this I saw another dream, and I will show the whole dream to thee, my son.",
        "85:2": "And Enoch lifted up (his voice) and spake to his son Methuselah: 'To thee, my son, will I speak: hear my words--incline thine ear to the dream-vision of thy father.",
        "85:3": "Before I took thy mother Edna, I saw in a vision on my bed, and behold a bull came forth from the earth, and that bull was white; and after it came forth a heifer, and along with this (latter) came forth two bulls, one of them black and the other red.",
        "85:4": "And that black bull gored the red one and pursued him over the earth, and thereupon I could no longer see that red bull.",
        "85:5": "But that black bull grew and that heifer went with him, and I saw that many oxen proceeded from him which resembled and followed him.",
        "85:6": "And that cow, that first one, went from the presence of that first bull in order to seek that red one, but found him not, and lamented with a great lamentation over him and sought him.",
        "85:7": "And I looked till that first bull came to her and quieted her, and from that time onward she cried no more.",
        "85:8": "And after that she bore another white bull, and after him she bore many bulls and black cows.",
        "85:9": "And I saw in my sleep that white bull likewise grow and become a great white bull, and from Him proceeded many white bulls, and they resembled him. And they began to beget many white bulls, which resembled them, one following the other, (even) many.",
        "86:1": "And again I saw with mine eyes as I slept, and I saw the heaven above, and behold a star fell from heaven, and it arose and eat and pastured amongst those oxen.",
        "86:2": "And after that I saw the large and the black oxen, and behold they all changed their stalls and pastures and their cattle, and began to live with each other.",
        "86:3": "And again I saw in the vision, and looked towards the heaven, and behold I saw many stars descend and cast themselves down from heaven to that first star, and they became bulls amongst those cattle and pastured with them ⌈amongst them⌉.",
        "86:4": "And I looked at them and saw, and behold they all let out their privy members, like horses, and began to cover the cows of the oxen, and they all became pregnant and bare elephants, camels, and asses.",
        "86:5": "And all the oxen feared them and were affrighted at them, and began to bite with their teeth and to devour, and to gore with their horns.",
        "86:6": "And they began, moreover, to devour those oxen; and behold all the children of the earth began to tremble and quake before them and to flee from them.",
        "87:1": "And again I saw how they began to gore each other and to devour each other, and the earth began to cry aloud.",
        "87:2": "And I raised mine eyes again to heaven, and I saw in the vision, and behold there came forth from heaven beings who were like white men: and four went forth from that place and three with them.",
        "87:3": "And those three that had last come forth grasped me by my hand and took me up, away from the generations of the earth, and raised me up to a lofty place, and showed me a tower raised high above the earth, and all the hills were lower.",
        "87:4": "And one said unto me: 'Remain here till thou seest everything that befalls those elephants, camels, and asses, and the stars and the oxen, and all of them.'",
        "88:1": "And I saw one of those four who had come forth first, and he seized that first star which had fallen from the heaven, and bound it hand and foot and cast it into an abyss: now that abyss was narrow and deep, and horrible and dark.",
        "88:2": "And one of them drew a sword, and gave it to those elephants and camels and asses: then they began to smite each other, and the whole earth quaked because of them.",
        "88:3": "And as I was beholding in the vision, lo, one of those four who had come forth stoned (them) from heaven, and gathered and took all the great stars whose privy members were like those of horses, and bound them all hand and foot, and cast them in an abyss of the earth.",
        "89:1": "And one of those four went to that white bull and instructed him in a secret, without his being terrified: he was born a bull and became a man, and built for himself a great vessel and dwelt thereon; and three bulls dwelt with him in that vessel and they were covered in.",
        "89:2": "And again I raised mine eyes towards heaven and saw a lofty roof, with seven water torrents thereon, and those torrents flowed with much water into an enclosure.",
        "89:3": "And I saw again, and behold fountains were opened on the surface of that great enclosure, and that water began to swell and rise upon the surface, and I saw that enclosure till all its surface was covered with water.",
        "89:4": "And the water, the darkness, and mist increased upon it; and as I looked at the height of that water, that water had risen above the height of that enclosure, and was streaming over that enclosure, and it stood upon the earth.",
        "89:5": "And all the cattle of that enclosure were gathered together until I saw how they sank and were swallowed up and perished in that water.",
        "89:6": "But that vessel floated on the water, while all the oxen and elephants and camels and asses sank to the bottom with all the animals, so that I could no longer see them, and they were not able to escape, (but) perished and sank into the depths.",
        "89:7": "And again I saw in the vision till those water torrents were removed from that high roof, and the chasms of the earth were levelled up and other abysses were opened.",
        "89:8": "Then the water began to run down into these, till the earth became visible; but that vessel settled on the earth, and the darkness retired and light appeared.",
        "89:9": "But that white bull which had become a man came out of that vessel, and the three bulls with him, and one of those three was white like that bull, and one of them was red as blood, and one black: and that white bull departed from them.",
        "89:10": "And they began to bring forth beasts of the field and birds, so that there arose different genera: lions, tigers, wolves, dogs, hyenas, wild boars, foxes, squirrels, swine, falcons, vultures, kites, eagles, and ravens; and among them was born a white bull.",
        "89:11": "And they began to bite one another; but that white bull which was born amongst them begat a wild ass and a white bull with it, and the wild asses multiplied.",
        "89:12": "But that bull which was born from him begat a black wild boar and a white sheep; and the former begat many boars, but that sheep begat twelve sheep.",
        "89:13": "And when those twelve sheep had grown, they gave up one of them to the asses, and those asses again gave up that sheep to the wolves, and that sheep grew up among the wolves.",
        "89:14": "And the Lord brought the eleven sheep to live with it and to pasture with it among the wolves: and they multiplied and became many flocks of sheep.",
        "89:15": "And the wolves began to fear them, and they oppressed them until they destroyed their little ones, and they cast their young into a river of much water: but those sheep began to cry aloud on account of their little ones, and to complain unto their Lord.",
        "89:16": "And a sheep which had been saved from the wolves fled and escaped to the wild asses; and I saw the sheep how they lamented and cried, and besought their Lord with all their might, till that Lord of the sheep descended at the voice of the sheep from a lofty abode, and came to them and pastured them.",
        "89:17": "And He called that sheep which had escaped the wolves, and spake with it concerning the wolves that it should admonish them not to touch the sheep.",
        "89:18": "And the sheep went to the wolves according to the word of the Lord, and another sheep met it and went with it, and the two went and entered together into the assembly of those wolves, and spake with them and admonished them not to touch the sheep from henceforth.",
        "89:19": "And thereupon I saw the wolves, and how they oppressed the sheep exceedingly with all their power; and the sheep cried aloud.",
        "89:20": "And the Lord came to the sheep and they began to smite those wolves: and the wolves began to make lamentation; but the sheep became quiet and forthwith ceased to cry out.",
        "89:21": "And I saw the sheep till they departed from amongst the wolves; but the eyes of the wolves were blinded, and those wolves departed in pursuit of the sheep with all their power.",
        "89:22": "And the Lord of the sheep went with them, as their leader, and all His sheep followed Him: and his face was dazzling and glorious and terrible to behold.",
        "89:23": "But the wolves began to pursue those sheep till they reached a sea of water.",
        "89:24": "And that sea was divided, and the water stood on this side and on that before their face, and their Lord led them and placed Himself between them and the wolves.",
        "89:25": "And as those wolves did not yet see the sheep, they proceeded into the midst of that sea, and the wolves followed the sheep, and [those wolves] ran after them into that sea.",
        "89:26": "And when they saw the Lord of the sheep, they turned to flee before His face, but that sea gathered itself together, and became as it had been created, and the water swelled and rose till it covered those wolves.",
        "89:27": "And I saw till all the wolves who pursued those sheep perished and were drowned.",
        "89:28": "But the sheep escaped from that water and went forth into a wilderness, where there was no water and no grass; and they began to open their eyes and to see; and I saw the Lord of the sheep pasturing them and giving them water and grass, and that sheep going and leading them.",
        "89:29": "And that sheep ascended to the summit of that lofty rock, and the Lord of the sheep sent it to them.",
        "89:30": "And after that I saw the Lord of the sheep who stood before them, and His appearance was great and terrible and majestic, and all those sheep saw Him and were afraid before His face.",
        "89:31": "And they all feared and trembled because of Him, and they cried to that sheep with them [which was amongst them]: \"We are not able to stand before our Lord or to behold Him.\"",
        "89:32": "And that sheep which led them again ascended to the summit of that rock, but the sheep began to be blinded and to wander from the way which he had showed them, but that sheep wot not thereof.",
        "89:33": "And the Lord of the sheep was wrathful exceedingly against them, and that sheep discovered it, and went down from the summit of the rock, and came to the sheep, and found the greatest part of them blinded and fallen away.",
        "89:34": "And when they saw it they feared and trembled at its presence, and desired to return to their folds.",
        "89:35": "And that sheep took other sheep with it, and came to those sheep which had fallen away, and began to slay them; and the sheep feared its presence, and thus that sheep brought back those sheep that had fallen away, and they returned to their folds.",
        "89:36": "And I saw in this vision till that sheep became a man and built a house for the Lord of the sheep, and placed all the sheep in that house.",
        "89:37": "And I saw till this sheep which had met that sheep which led them fell asleep: and I saw till all the great sheep perished and little ones arose in their place, and they came to a pasture, and approached a stream of water.",
        "89:38": "Then that sheep, their leader which had become a man, withdrew from them and fell asleep, and all the sheep sought it and cried over it with a great crying.",
        "89:39": "And I saw till they left off crying for that sheep and crossed that stream of water, and there arose the two sheep as leaders in the place of those which had led them and fallen asleep (lit. \"had fallen asleep and led them\").",
        "89:40": "And I saw till the sheep came to a goodly place, and a pleasant and glorious land, and I saw till those sheep were satisfied; and that house stood amongst them in the pleasant land.",
        "89:41": "And sometimes their eyes were opened, and sometimes blinded, till another sheep arose and led them and brought them all back, and their eyes were opened.",
        "89:42": "And the dogs and the foxes and the wild boars began to devour those sheep till the Lord of the sheep raised up [another sheep] a ram from their midst, which led them.",
        "89:43": "And that ram began to butt on either side those dogs, foxes, and wild boars till he had destroyed them †all†.",
        "89:44": "And that sheep whose eyes were opened saw that ram, which was amongst the sheep, till it †forsook its glory† and began to butt those sheep, and trampled upon them, and behaved itself unseemly.",
        "89:45": "And the Lord of the sheep sent the lamb to another lamb and raised it to being a ram and leader of the sheep instead of that ram which had †forsaken its glory†.",
        "89:46": "And it went to it and spake to it alone, and raised it to being a ram, and made it the prince and leader of the sheep; but during all these things those dogs oppressed the sheep.",
        "89:47": "And the first ram pursued that second ram, and that second ram arose and fled before it; and I saw till those dogs pulled down the first ram.",
        "89:48": "And that second ram arose and led the [little] sheep.",
        "89:49": "And those sheep grew and multiplied; but all the dogs, and foxes, and wild boars feared and fled before it, and that ram butted and kiled the wild beasts, and those wild beasts had no longer any power among the sheep and robbed them no more of ought. [89:48b] And that ram begat many sheep and fell asleep; and a little sheep became ram in its stead, and became prince and leader of those sheep.",
        "89:50": "And that house became great and broad, and it was built for those sheep: (and) a tower lofty and great was built on the house for the Lord of the sheep, and that house was low, but the tower was elevated and lofty, and the Lord of the sheep stood on that tower and they offered a full table before Him.",
        "89:51": "And again I saw those sheep that they again erred and went many ways, and forsook that their house, and the Lord of the sheep called some from amongst the sheep and sent them to the sheep, but the sheep began to slay them.",
        "89:52": "And one of them was saved and was not slain, and it sped away and cried aloud over the sheep; and they sought to slay it, but the Lord of the sheep saved it from the sheep, and brought it up to me, and caused it to dwell there.",
        "89:53": "And many other sheep He sent to those sheep to testify unto them and lament over them.",
        "89:54": "And after that I saw that when they forsook the house of the Lord and His tower they fell away entirely, and their eyes were blinded; and I saw the Lord of the sheep how He wrought much slaughter amongst them in their herds until those sheep invited that slaughter and betrayed His place.",
        "89:55": "And He gave them over into the hands of the lions and tigers, and wolves and hyenas, and into the hand of the foxes, and to all the wild beasts, and those wild beasts began to tear in pieces those sheep.",
        "89:56": "And I saw that He forsook that their house and their tower and gave them all into the hand of the lions, to tear and devour them, into the hand of all the wild beasts.",
        "89:57": "And I began to cry aloud with all my power, and to appeal to the Lord of the sheep, and to represent to Him in regard to the sheep that they were devoured by all the wild beasts.",
        "89:58": "But He remained unmoved, though He saw it, and rejoiced that they were devoured and swallowed and robbed, and left them to be devoured in the hand of all the beasts.",
        "89:59": "And He called seventy shepherds, and cast those sheep to them that they might pasture them, and He spake to the shepherds and their companions: \"Let each individual of you pasture the sheep henceforward, and everything that I shall command you that do ye.",
        "89:60": "And I will deliver them over unto you duly numbered, and tell you which of them are to be destroyed--and them destroy ye.\" And He gave over unto them those sheep.",
        "89:61": "And He called another and spake unto him: \"Observe and mark everything that the shepherds will do to those sheep; for they will destroy more of them than I have commanded them.",
        "89:62": "And every excess and the destruction which will be wrought through the shepherds, record (namely) how many they destroy according to my command, and how many according to their own caprice: record against every individual shepherd all the destruction he effects.",
        "89:63": "And read out before me by number how many they destroy, and how many they deliver over for destruction, that I may have this as a testimony against them, and know every deed of the shepherds, that I may comprehend and see what they do, whether or not they abide by my command which I have commanded them.",
        "89:64": "But they shall not know it, and thou shalt not declare it to them, nor admonish them, but only record against each individual all the destruction which the shepherds effect each in his time and lay it all before me.\"",
        "89:65": "And I saw till those shepherds pastured in their season, and they began to slay and to destroy more than they were bidden, and they delivered those sheep into the hand of the lions.",
        "89:66": "And the lions and tigers eat and devoured the greater part of those sheep, and the wild boars eat along with them; and they burnt that tower and demolished that house.",
        "89:67": "And I became exceedingly sorrowful over that tower because that house of the sheep was demolished, and afterwards I was unable to see if those sheep entered that house.",
        "89:68": "And the shepherds and their associates delivered over those sheep to all the wild beasts, to devour them, and each one of them received in his time a definite number: it was written by the other in a book how many each one of them destroyed of them.",
        "89:69": "And each one slew and destroyed many more than was prescribed; and I began to weep and lament on account of those sheep.",
        "89:70": "And thus in the vision I saw that one who wrote, how he wrote down every one that was destroyed by those shepherds, day by day, and carried up and laid down and showed actually the whole book to the Lord of the sheep--(even) everything that they had done, and all that each one of them had made away with, and all that they had given over to destruction.",
        "89:71": "And the book was read before the Lord of the sheep, and He took the book from his hand and read it and sealed it and laid it down.",
        "89:72": "And forthwith I saw how the shepherds pastured for twelve hours, and behold three of those sheep turned back and came and entered and began to build up all that had fallen down of that house; but the wild boars tried to hinder them, but they were not able.",
        "89:73": "And they began again to build as before, and they reared up that tower, and it was named the high tower; and they began again to place a table before the tower, but all the bread on it was polluted and not pure.",
        "89:74": "And as touching all this the eyes of those sheep were blinded so that they saw not, and (the eyes of) their shepherds likewise; and they delivered them in large numbers to their shepherds for destruction, and they trampled the sheep with their feet and devoured them.",
        "89:75": "And the Lord of the sheep remained unmoved till all the sheep were dispersed over the field and mingled with them (i.e. the beasts), and they (i.e. the shepherds) did not save them out of the hand of the beasts.",
        "89:76": "And this one who wrote the book carried it up, and showed it and read it before the Lord of the sheep, and implored Him on their account, and besought Him on their account as he showed Him all the doings of the shepherds, and gave testimony before Him against all the shepherds. And he took the actual book and laid it down beside Him and departed.",
        "90:1": "And I saw till that in this manner thirty-five shepherds undertook the pasturing (of the sheep), and they severally completed their periods as did the first; and others received them into their hands, to pasture them for their period, each shepherd in his own period.",
        "90:2": "And after that I saw in my vision all the birds of heaven coming, the eagles, the vultures, the kites, the ravens; but the eagles led all the birds; and they began to devour those sheep, and to pick out their eyes and to devour their flesh.",
        "90:3": "And the sheep cried out because their flesh was being devoured by the birds, and as for me I looked and lamented in my sleep over that shepherd who pastured the sheep.",
        "90:4": "And I saw until those sheep were devoured by the dogs and eagles and kites, and they left neither flesh nor skin nor sinew remaining on them till only their bones stood there: and their bones too fell to the earth and the sheep became few.",
        "90:5": "And I saw until that twenty-three had undertaken the pasturing and completed in their several periods fifty-eight times.",
        "90:6": "But behold lambs were borne by those white sheep, and they began to open their eyes and to see, and to cry to the sheep.",
        "90:7": "Yea, they cried to them, but they did not hearken to what they said to them, but were exceedingly deaf, and their eyes were very exceedingly blinded.",
        "90:8": "And I saw in the vision how the ravens flew upon those lambs and took one of those lambs, and dashed the sheep in pieces and devoured them.",
        "90:9": "And I saw till horns grew upon those lambs, and the ravens cast down their horns; and I saw till there sprouted a great horn of one of those sheep, and their eyes were opened.",
        "90:10": "And it †looked at† them [and their eyes opened], and it cried to the sheep, and the rams saw it and all ran to it.",
        "90:11": "And notwithstanding all this those eagles and vultures and ravens and kites still kept tearing the sheep and swooping down upon them and devouring them: still the sheep remained silent, but the rams lamented and cried out.",
        "90:12": "And those ravens fought and battled with it and sought to lay low its horn, but they had no power over it.",
        "90:13": "And I saw till the †shepherds and† eagles and those vultures and kites came, and †they cried to the ravens† that they should break the horn of that ram, and they battled and fought with it, and it battled with them and cried that its help might come.",
        "90:16": "All the eagles and vultures and ravens and kites were gathered together, and there came with them all the sheep of the field, yea, they all came together, and helped each other to break that horn of the ram.",
        "90:19": "And I saw till a great sword was given to the sheep, and the sheep proceeded against all the beasts of the field to slay them, and all the beasts and the birds of the heaven fled before their face.",
        "90:14": "And I saw till that man, who wrote down the names of the shepherds [and] carried up into the presence of the Lord of the sheep [came and helped it and showed it everything: he had come down for the help of that ram].",
        "90:17": "And I saw that man, who wrote the book according to the command of the Lord, till he opened that book concerning the destruction which those twelve last shepherds had wrought, and showed that they had destroyed much more than their predecessors, before the Lord of the sheep.",
        "90:15": "And I saw till the Lord of the sheep came unto them in wrath, and all who saw Him fled, and they all fell †into His shadow† from before His face.",
        "90:18": "And I saw till the Lord of the sheep came unto them and took in His hand the staff of His wrath, and smote the earth, and the earth clave asunder, and all the beasts and all the birds of the heaven fell from among those sheep, and were swallowed up in the earth and it covered them.",
        "90:20": "And I saw till a throne was erected in the pleasant land, and the Lord of the sheep sat Himself thereon, and the other took the sealed books and opened those books before the Lord of the sheep.",
        "90:21": "And the Lord called those men the seven first white ones, and commanded that they should bring before Him, beginning with the first star which led the way, all the stars whose privy members were like those of horses, and they brought them all before Him.",
        "90:22": "And He said to that man who wrote before Him, being one of those seven white ones, and said unto him: \"Take those seventy shepherds to whom I delivered the sheep, and who taking them on their own authority slew more than I commanded them.\"",
        "90:23": "And behold they were all bound, I saw, and they all stood before Him.",
        "90:24": "And the judgement was held first over the stars, and they were judged and found guilty, and went to the place of condemnation, and they were cast into an abyss, full of fire and flaming, and full of pillars of fire.",
        "90:25": "And those seventy shepherds were judged and found guilty, and they were cast into that fiery abyss.",
        "90:26": "And I saw at that time how a like abyss was opened in the midst of the earth, full of fire, and they brought those blinded sheep, and they were all judged and found guilty and cast into this fiery abyss, and they burned; now this abyss was to the right of that house.",
        "90:27": "And I saw those sheep burning †and their bones burning†.",
        "90:28": "And I stood up to see till they folded up that old house; and carried off all the pillars, and all the beams and ornaments of the house were at the same time folded up with it, and they carried it off and laid it in a place in the south of the land.",
        "90:29": "And I saw till the Lord of the sheep brought a new house greater and loftier than that first, and set it up in the place of the first which had beer folded up: all its pillars were new, and its ornaments were new and larger than those of the first, the old one which He had taken away, and all the sheep were within it.",
        "90:30": "And I saw all the sheep which had been left, and all the beasts on the earth, and all the birds of the heaven, falling down and doing homage to those sheep and making petition to and obeying them in every thing.",

        "108:3": "And wait ye indeed till sin has passed away, for their names shall be blotted out of the book of life and out of the holy books, and their seed shall be destroyed for ever, and their spirits shall be slain, and they shall cry and make lamentation in a place that is a chaotic wilderness, and in the fire shall they burn; for there is no earth there.",
        "108:4": "And I saw there something like an invisible cloud; for by reason of its depth I could not look over, and I saw a flame of fire blazing brightly, and things like shining mountains circling and sweeping to and fro.",

        "108:10": "And all the blessings destined for them I have recounted in the books. And he hath assigned them their recompense, because they have been found to be such as loved heaven more than their life in the world, and though they were trodden under foot of wicked men, and experienced abuse and reviling from them and were put to shame, yet they blessed Me.",
        "108:11": "And now I will summon the spirits of the good who belong to the generation of light, and I will transform those who were born in darkness, who in the flesh were not recompensed with such honour as their faithfulness deserved.",
        "108:12": "And I will bring forth in shining light those who have loved My holy name, and I will seat each on the throne of his honour.",
        "108:13": "And they shall be resplendent for times without number; for righteousness is the judgement of God; for to the faithful He will give faithfulness in the habitation of upright paths.",
        "108:14": "And they shall see those who were, born in darkness led into darkness, while the righteous shall be resplendent.",

        "13:2": "And I saw six gates open, each gate having sixty-one stadia and A quarter of one stadium, and I measured (them) truly, and understood their size (to be) so much, through which the sun goes forth, and goes to the west, and is made even, and rises throughout all the months, and turns back again from the six gates according to the succession of the seasons; thus (the period) of the whole year is finished after the returns of the four seasons.",
        "14:1": "And again those men led me away to the western parts, and showed me six great gates open corresponding to the eastern gates, opposite to where the sun sets, according to the number of the days three hundred and sixty-five and A quarter.",
        "14:2": "Thus again it goes down to the western gates, (and) draws away its light, the greatness of its brightness, under the earth; for since the crown of its shining is in heaven with the Lord, and guarded by four hundred angels, while the sun goes round on wheel under the earth, and stands seven great hours in night, and spends half (its course) under the earth, when it comes to the eastern approach in the eighth hour of the night, it brings its lights, and the crown of shining, and the sun flames forth more than fire.",
        "15:1": "Then the elements of the sun, called Phoenixes and Chalkydri break into song, therefore every bird flutters with its wings, rejoicing at the giver of light, and they broke into song at the command of the Lord.",
        "15:2": "The giver of light comes to give brightness to the whole world, and the morning guard takes shape, which is the rays of the sun, and the sun of the earth goes out, and receives its brightness to light up the whole face of the earth, and they showed me this calculation of the sun’s going.",
        "15:3": "And the gates which it enters, these are the great gates of the calculation of the hours of the year; for this reason the sun is a great creation, whose circuit (lasts) twenty-eight years, and begins again from the beginning.",
        "16:1": "Those men showed me the other course, that of the moon, twelve great gates, crowned from west to east, by which the moon goes in and out of the customary times.",
        "16:2": "It goes in at the first gate to the western places of the sun, by the first gates with (thirty)-one (days) exactly, by the second gates with thirty-one days exactly, by the third with thirty days exactly, by the fourth with thirty days exactly, by the fifth with thirty-one days exactly, by the sixth with thirty-one days exactly, by the seventh with thirty days exactly, by the eighth with thirty-one days perfectly, by the ninth with thirty-one days exactly, by the tenth with thirty days perfectly, by the eleventh with thirty-one days exactly, by the twelfth with twenty-eight days exactly.",
        "16:3": "And it goes through the western gates in the order and number of the eastern, and accomplishes the three hundred and sixty-five and a quarter days of the solar year, while the lunar year has three hundred fifty-four, and there are wanting (to it) twelve days of the solar circle, which are the lunar epacts of the whole year.",
        "16:4": "Thus, too, the great circle contains five hundred and thirty-two years.",
        "16:5": "The quarter (of a day) is omitted for three years, the fourth fulfills it exactly.",
        "16:6": "Therefore they are taken outside of heaven for three years and are not added to the number of days, because they change the time of the years to two new months towards completion, to two others towards diminution.",
        "16:7": "And when the western gates are finished, it returns and goes to the eastern to the lights, and goes thus day and night about the heavenly circles, lower than all circles, swifter than the heavenly winds, and spirits and elements and angels flying; each angel has six wings.",
        "16:8": "It has a sevenfold course in nineteen years.",
        "17:1": "In the midst of the heavens I saw armed soldiers, serving the Lord, with tympana and organs, with incessant voice, with sweet voice, with sweet and incessant (voice) and various singing, which it is impossible to describe, and (which) astonishes every mind, so wonderful and marvellous is the singing of those angels, and I was delighted listening to it.",
        "18:1": "The men took me on to the fifth heaven and placed me, and there I saw many and countless soldiers, called Grigori, of human appearance, and their size (was) greater than that of great giants and their faces withered, and the silence of their mouths perpetual, and their was no service on the fifth heaven, and I said to the men who were with me:",
        "18:2": "Wherefore are these very withered and their faces melancholy, and their mouths silent, and (wherefore) is there no service on this heaven?",
        "18:3": "And they said to me: These are the Grigori, who with their prince Satanail (Satan) rejected the Lord of light, and after them are those who are held in great darkness on the second heaven, and three of them went down on to earth from the Lord’s throne, to the place Ermon, and broke through their vows on the shoulder of the hill Ermon and saw the daughters of men how good they are, and took to themselves wives, and befouled the earth with their deeds, who in all times of their age made lawlessness and mixing, and giants are born and marvelous big men and great enmity.",
        "18:4": "And therefore God judged them with great judgment, and they weep for their brethren and they will be punished on the Lord’s great day.",
        "18:5": "And I said to the Grigori: I saw your brethren and their works, and their great torments, and I prayed for them, but the Lord has condemned them (to be) under earth till (the existing) heaven and earth shall end for ever.",
        "18:6": "And I said: Wherefore do you wait, brethren, and do not serve before the Lord’s face, and have not put your services before the Lord’s face, lest you anger your Lord utterly?",
        "18:7": "And they listened to my admonition, and spoke to the four ranks in heaven, and lo! As I stood with those two men four trumpets trumpeted together with great voice, and the Grigori broke into song with one voice, and their voice went up before the Lord pitifully and affectingly.",
        "19:1": "And thence those men took me and bore me up on to the sixth heaven, and there I saw seven bands of angels, very bright and very glorious, and their faces shining more than the sun’s shining, glistening, and there is no difference in their faces, or behaviour, or manner of dress; and these make the orders, and learn the goings of the stars, and the alteration of the moon, or revolution of the sun, and the good government of the world.",
        "19:2": "And when they see evildoing they make commandments and instruction, and sweet and loud singing, and all (songs) of praise.",
        "19:3": "These are the archangels who are above angels, measure all life in heaven and on earth, and the angels who are (appointed) over seasons and years, the angels who are over rivers and sea, and who are over the fruits of the earth, and the angels who are over every grass, giving food to all, to every living thing, and the angels who write all the souls of men, and all their deeds, and their lives before the Lord’s face; in their midst are six Phoenixes and six Cherubim and six six-winged ones continually with one voice singing one voice, and it is not possible to describe their singing, and they rejoice before the Lord at his footstool.",
        "20:1": "And those two men lifted me up thence on to the seventh heaven, and I saw there a very great light, and fiery troops of great archangels, incorporeal forces, and dominions, orders and governments, Cherubim and seraphim, thrones and many-eyed ones, nine regiments, the Ioanit stations of light, and I became afraid, and began to tremble with great terror, and those men took me, and led me after them, and said to me:",
        "20:2": "Have courage, Enoch, do not fear, and showed me the Lord from afar, sitting on His very high throne. For what is there on the tenth heaven, since the Lord dwells there?",
        "20:3": "On the tenth heaven is God, in the Hebrew tongue he is called Aravat.",
        "20:4": "And all the heavenly troops would come and stand on the ten steps according to their rank, and would bow down to the Lord, and would again go to their places in joy and felicity, singing songs in the boundless light with small and tender voices, gloriously serving him.",
        "21:1": "And the Cherubim and seraphim standing about the throne, the six-winged and manyeyed ones do not depart, standing before the Lord’s face doing his will, and cover his whole throne, singing with gentle voice before the Lord’s face: Holy, holy, holy, Lord Ruler of Sabaoth, heavens and earth are full of Your glory.",
        "21:2": "When I saw all these things, those men said to me: Enoch, thus far is it commanded us to journey with you, and those men went away from me and thereupon I saw them not.",
        "21:3": "And I remained alone at the end of the seventh heaven and became afraid, and fell on my face and said to myself: Woe is me, what has befallen me?",
        "21:4": "And the Lord sent one of his glorious ones, the archangel Gabriel, and (he) said to me: Have courage, Enoch, do not fear, arise before the Lord’s face into eternity, arise, come with me.",
        "21:5": "And I answered him, and said in myself: My Lord, my soul is departed from me, from terror and trembling, and I called to the men who led me up to this place, on them I relied, and (it is) with them I go before the Lord’s face.",
        "21:6": "And Gabriel caught me up, as a leaf caught up by the wind, and placed me before the Lord’s face.",
        "21:7": "And I saw the eighth heaven, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Muzaloth, changer of the seasons, of drought, and of wet, and of the twelve constellations of the circle of the firmament, which are above the seventh heaven.",
        "21:8": "And I saw the ninth heaven, which is called in Hebrew Kuchavim, where are the heavenly homes of the twelve constellations of the circle of the firmament.",
        "22:1": "On the tenth heaven, (which is called) Aravoth, I saw the appearance of the Lord’s face, like iron made to glow in fire, and brought out, emitting sparks, and it burns.",
        "22:2": "Thus (in a moment of eternity) I saw the Lord's face, but the Lord’s face is ineffable, marvellous and very awful, and very, very terrible.",
        "22:3": "And who am I to tell of the Lord’s unspeakable being, and of his very wonderful face? And I cannot tell the quantity of his many instructions, and various voices, the Lord's throne (is) very great and not made with hands, nor the quantity of those standing round him, troops of Cherubim and seraphim, nor their incessant singing, nor his immutable beauty, and who shall tell of the ineffable greatness of his glory.",
        "22:4": "And I fell prone and bowed down to the Lord, and the Lord with his lips said to me:",
        "22:5": "Have courage, Enoch, do not fear, arise and stand before my face into eternity.",
        "22:6": "And the archistratege Michael lifted me up, and led me to before the Lord’s face.",
        "22:7": "And the Lord said to his servants tempting them: Let Enoch stand before my face into eternity, and the glorious ones bowed down to the Lord, and said: Let Enoch go according to Your word.",
        "22:8": "And the Lord said to Michael: Go and take Enoch from out (of) his earthly garments, and anoint him with my sweet ointment, and put him into the garments of My glory.",
        "22:9": "And Michael did thus, as the Lord told him. He anointed me, and dressed me, and the appearance of that ointment is more than the great light, and his ointment is like sweet dew, and its smell mild, shining like the sun’s ray, and I looked at myself, and (I) was like (transfigured) one of his glorious ones.",
        "22:10": "And the Lord summoned one of his archangels by name Pravuil, whose knowledge was quicker in wisdom than the other archangels, who wrote all the deeds of the Lord; and the Lord said to Pravuil: Bring out the books from my store-houses, and a reed of quick-writing, and give (it) to Enoch, and deliver to him the choice and comforting books out of your hand.",
        "23:1": "And he was telling me all the works of heaven, earth and sea, and all the elements, their passages and goings, and the thunderings of the thunders, the sun and moon, the goings and changes of the stars, the seasons, years, days, and hours, the risings of the wind, the numbers of the angels, and the formation of their songs, and all human things, the tongue of every human song and life, the commandments, instructions, and sweet-voiced singings, and all things that it is fitting to learn.",
        "23:2": "And Pravuil told me: All the things that I have told you, we have written. Sit and write all the souls of mankind, however many of them are born, and the places prepared for them to eternity; for all souls are prepared to eternity, before the formation of the world.",
        "23:3": "And all double thirty days and thirty nights, and I wrote out all things exactly, and wrote three hundred and sixty-six books.",
        "24:1": "And the Lord summoned me, and said to me: Enoch, sit down on my left with Gabriel.",
        "24:2": "And I bowed down to the Lord, and the Lord spoke to me: Enoch, beloved, all (that) you see, all things that are standing finished I tell to you even before the very beginning, all that I created from non-being, and visible (physical) things from invisible (spiritual).",
        "24:3": "Hear, Enoch, and take in these my words, for not to My angels have I told my secret, and I have not told them their rise, nor my endless realm, nor have they understood my creating, which I tell you to-day.",
        "24:4": "For before all things were visible (physical), I alone used to go about in the invisible (spiritual) things, like the sun from east to west, and from west to east.",
        "24:5": "But even the sun has peace in itself, while I found no peace, because I was creating all things, and I conceived the thought of placing foundations, and of creating visible (physical) creation.",
        "25:1": "I commanded in the very lowest (parts), that visible (physical) things should come down from invisible (spiritual), and Adoil came down very great, and I beheld him, and lo! He had a belly of great light.",
        "25:2": "And I said to him: Become undone, Adoil, and let the visible (physical) (come) out of you.",
        "25:3": "And he came undone, and a great light came out. And I (was) in the midst of the great light, and as there is born light from light, there came forth a great age, and showed all creation, which I had thought to create.",
        "25:4": "And I saw that (it was) good.",
        "25:5": "And I placed for myself a throne, and took my seat on it, and said to the light: Go thence up higher and fix yourself high above the throne, and be A foundation to the highest things.",
        "25:6": "And above the light there is nothing else, and then I bent up and looked up from my throne.",
        "26:1": "And I summoned the very lowest a second time, and said: Let Archas come forth hard, and he came forth hard from the invisible (spiritual).",
        "26:2": "And Archas came forth, hard, heavy, and very red.",
        "26:3": "And I said: Be opened, Archas, and let there be born from you, and he came undone, an age came forth, very great and very dark, bearing the creation of all lower things, and I saw that (it was) good and said to him:",
        "26:4": "Go thence down below, and make yourself firm, and be a foundation for the lower things, and it happened and he went down and fixed himself, and became the foundation for the lower things, and below the darkness there is nothing else.",
        "27:1": "And I commanded that there should be taken from light and darkness, and I said: Be thick, and it became thus, and I spread it out with the light, and it became water, and I spread it out over the darkness, below the light, and then I made firm the waters, that is to say the bottomless, and I made foundation of light around the water, and created seven circles from inside, and imaged (the water) like crystal wet and dry, that is to say like glass, (and) the circumcession of the waters and the other elements, and I showed each one of them its road, and the seven stars each one of them in its heaven, that they go thus, and I saw that it was good.",
        "27:2": "And I separated between light and between darkness, that is to say in the midst of the water hither and thither, and I said to the light, that it should be the day, and to the darkness, that it should be the night, and there was evening and there was morning the first day.",
        "28:1": "And then I made firm the heavenly circle, and (made) that the lower water which is under heaven collect itself together, into one whole, and that the chaos become dry, and it became so.",
        "28:2": "Out of the waves I created rock hard and big, and from the rock I piled up the dry, and the dry I called earth, and the midst of the earth I called abyss, that is to say the bottomless, I collected the sea in one place and bound it together with a yoke.",
        "28:3": "And I said to the sea: Behold I give you (your) eternal limits, and you shalt not break loose from your component parts.",
        "28:4": "Thus I made fast the firmament. This day I called me the first-created [Sunday].",
        "29:1": "And for all the heavenly troops I imaged the image and essence of fire, and my eye looked at the very hard, firm rock, and from the gleam of my eye the lightning received its wonderful nature, (which) is both fire in water and water in fire, and one does not put out the other, nor does the one dry up the other, therefore the lightning is brighter than the sun, softer than water and firmer than hard rock.",
        "29:2": "And from the rock I cut off a great fire, and from the fire I created the orders of the incorporeal ten troops of angels, and their weapons are fiery and their raiment a burning flame, and I commanded that each one should stand in his order.",
        "29:3": "And one from out the order of angels, having turned away with the order that was under him, conceived an impossible thought, to place his throne higher than the clouds above the earth, that he might become equal in rank to my power.",
        "29:4": "And I threw him out from the height with his angels, and he was flying in the air continuously above the bottomless.",
        "30:1": "On the third day I commanded the earth to make grow great and fruitful trees, and hills, and seed to sow, and I planted Paradise, and enclosed it, and placed as armed (guardians) flaming angels, and thus I created renewal.",
        "30:2": "Then came evening, and came morning the fourth day.",
        "30:3": "[Wednesday]. On the fourth day I commanded that there should be great lights on the heavenly circles.",
        "30:4": "On the first uppermost circle I placed the stars, Kruno, and on the second Aphrodit, on the third Aris, on the fifth Zoues, on the sixth Ermis, on the seventh lesser the moon, and adorned it with the lesser stars.",
        "30:5": "And on the lower I placed the sun for the illumination of day, and the moon and stars for the illumination of night.",
        "30:6": "The sun that it should go according to each constellation, twelve, and I appointed the succession of the months and their names and lives, their thunderings, and their hourmarkings, how they should succeed.",
        "30:7": "Then evening came and morning came the fifth day.",
        "30:8": "[Thursday]. On the fifth day I commanded the sea, that it should bring forth fishes, and feathered birds of many varieties, and all animals creeping over the earth, going forth over the earth on four legs, and soaring in the air, male sex and female, and every soul breathing the spirit of life.",
        "30:9": "And there came evening, and there came morning the sixth day.",
        "30:10": "[Friday]. On the sixth day I commanded my wisdom to create man from seven consistencies: one, his flesh from the earth; two, his blood from the dew; three, his eyes from the sun; four, his bones from stone; five, his intelligence from the swiftness of the angels and from cloud; six, his veins and his hair from the grass of the earth; seven, his soul from my breath and from the wind.",
        "30:11": "And I gave him seven natures: to the flesh hearing, the eyes for sight, to the soul smell, the veins for touch, the blood for taste, the bones for endurance, to the intelligence sweetness [enjoyment].",
        "30:12": "I conceived a cunning saying to say, I created man from invisible (spiritual) and from visible (physical) nature, of both are his death and life and image, he knows speech like some created thing, small in greatness and again great in smallness, and I placed him on earth, a second angel, honourable, great and glorious, and I appointed him as ruler to rule on earth and to have my wisdom, and there was none like him of earth of all my existing creatures.",
        "30:13": "And I appointed him a name, from the four component parts, from east, from west, from south, from north, and I appointed for him four special stars, and I called his name Adam, and showed him the two ways, the light and the darkness, and I told him:",
        "30:14": "This is good, and that bad, that I should learn whether he has love towards me, or hatred, that it be clear which in his race love me.",
        "30:15": "For I have seen his nature, but he has not seen his own nature, therefore (through) not seeing he will sin worse, and I said After sin (what is there) but death?",
        "30:16": "And I put sleep into him and he fell asleep. And I took from him A rib, and created him a wife, that death should come to him by his wife, and I took his last word and called her name mother, that is to say, Eva (Eve).",
        "31:1": "Adam has life on earth, and I created a garden in Eden in the east, that he should observe the testament and keep the command.",
        "31:2": "I made the heavens open to him, that he should see the angels singing the song of victory, and the gloomless light.",
        "31:3": "And he was continuously in paradise, and the devil understood that I wanted to create another world, because Adam was lord on earth, to rule and control it.",
        "31:4": "The devil is the evil spirit of the lower places, as a fugitive he made Sotona from the heavens as his name was Satanail (Satan), thus he became different from the angels, (but his nature) did not change (his) intelligence as far as (his) understanding of righteous and sinful (things).",
        "31:5": "And he understood his condemnation and the sin which he had sinned before, therefore he conceived thought against Adam, in such form he entered and seduced Eva (Eve), but did not touch Adam.",
        "31:6": "But I cursed ignorance, but what I had blessed previously, those I did not curse, I cursed not man, nor the earth, nor other creatures, but man’s evil fruit, and his works.",
        "32:1": "I said to him: Earth you are, and into the earth whence I took you you shalt go, and I will not ruin you, but send you whence I took you.",
        "32:2": "Then I can again receive you at My second presence.",
        "32:3": "And I blessed all my creatures visible (physical) and invisible (spiritual). And Adam was five and half hours in paradise.",
        "32:4": "And I blessed the seventh day, which is the Sabbath, on which he rested from all his works.",
        "33:1": "And I appointed the eighth day also, that the eighth day should be the first-created after my work, and that (the first seven) revolve in the form of the seventh thousand, and that at the beginning of the eighth thousand there should be a time of not-counting, endless, with neither years nor months nor weeks nor days nor hours.",
        "33:2": "And now, Enoch, all that I have told you, all that you have understood, all that you have seen of heavenly things, all that you have seen on earth, and all that I have written in books by my great wisdom, all these things I have devised and created from the uppermost foundation to the lower and to the end, and there is no counsellor nor inheritor to my creations.",
        "33:3": "I am self-eternal, not made with hands, and without change.",
        "33:4": "My thought is my counsellor, my wisdom and my word are made, and my eyes observe all things how they stand here and tremble with terror.",
        "33:5": "If I turn away my face, then all things will be destroyed.",
        "33:6": "And apply your mind, Enoch, and know him who is speaking to you, and take thence the books which you yourself have written.",
        "33:7": "And I give you Samuil and Raguil, who led you up, and the books, and go down to earth, and tell your sons all that I have told you, and all that you have seen, from the lower heaven up to my throne, and all the troops.",
        "33:8": "For I created all forces, and there is none that resists me or that does not subject himself to me. For all subject themselves to my monarchy, and labour for my sole rule.",
        "33:9": "Give them the books of the handwriting, and they will read (them) and will know me for the creator of all things, and will understand how there is no other God but me.",
        "33:10": "And let them distribute the books of your handwriting–children to children, generation to generation, nations to nations.",
        "33:11": "And I will give you, Enoch, my intercessor, the archistratege Michael, for the handwritings of your fathers Adam, Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahaleleel, and Jared your father.",
        "34:1": "They have rejected my commandments and my yoke, worthless seed has come up, not fearing God, and they would not bow down to me, but have begun to bow down to vain gods, and denied my unity, and have laden the whole earth with untruths, offences, abominable lecheries, namely one with another, and all manner of other unclean wickedness, which are disgusting to relate.",
        "34:2": "And therefore I will bring down a deluge upon the earth and will destroy all men, and the whole earth will crumble together into great darkness.",
        "35:1": "Behold from their seed shall arise another generation, much afterwards, but of them many will be very insatiate.",
        "35:2": "He who raises that generation, (shall) reveal to them the books of your handwriting, of your fathers, (to them) to whom he must point out the guardianship of the world, to the faithful men and workers of my pleasure, who do not acknowledge my name in vain.",
        "35:3": "And they shall tell another generation, and those (others) having read shall be glorified thereafter, more than the first.",
        "36:1": "Now, Enoch, I give you the term of thirty days to spend in your house, and tell your sons and all your household, that all may hear from my face what is told them by you, that they may read and understand, how there is no other God but me.",
        "36:2": "And that they may always keep my commandments, and begin to read and take in the books of your handwriting.",
        "36:3": "And after thirty days I shall send my angel for you, and he will take you from earth and from your sons to me.",
        "37:1": "And the Lord called upon one of the older angels, terrible and menacing, and placed him by me, in appearance white as snow, and his hands like ice, having the appearance of great frost, and he froze my face, because I could not endure the terror of the Lord, just as it is not possible to endure A stove’s fire and the sun’s heat, and the frost of the air.",
        "37:2": "And the Lord said to me: Enoch, if your face be not frozen here, no man will be able to behold your face.",
        "38:1": "And the Lord said to those men who first led me up: Let Enoch go down on to earth with you, and await him till the determined day.",
        "38:2": "And they placed me by night on my bed.",
        "38:3": "And Mathusal (Methuselah) expecting my coming, keeping watch by day and by night at my bed, was filled with awe when he heard my coming, and I told him, Let all my household come together, that I tell them everything.",
        "39:1": "Oh my children, my beloved ones, hear the admonition of your father, as much as is according to the Lord’s will.",
        "39:2": "I have been let come to you to-day, and announce to you, not from my lips, but from the Lord’s lips, all that is and was and all that is now, and all that will be till judgmentday.",
        "39:3": "For the Lord has let me come to you, you hear therefore the words of my lips, of a man made big for you, but I am one who has seen the Lord’s face, like iron made to glow from fire it sends forth sparks and burns.",
        "39:4": "You look now upon my eyes, (the eyes) of a man big with meaning for you, but I have seen the Lord’s eyes, shining like the sun’s rays and filling the eyes of man with awe.",
        "39:5": "You see now, my children, the right hand of a man that helps you, but I have seen the Lord’s right hand filling heaven as he helped me.",
        "39:6": "You see the compass of my work like your own, but I have seen the Lord’s limitless and perfect compass, which has no end.",
        "39:7": "You hear the words of my lips, as I heard the words of the Lord, like great thunder incessantly with hurling of clouds.",
        "39:8": "And now, my children, hear the discourses of the father of the earth, how fearful and awful it is to come before the face of the ruler of the earth, how much more terrible and awful it is to come before the face of the ruler of heaven, the controller (judge) of quick and dead, and of the heavenly troops. Who can endure that endless pain?",
        "40:1": "And now, my children, I know all things, for this (is) from the Lord’s lips, and this my eyes have seen, from beginning to end.",
        "40:2": "I know all things, and have written all things into books, the heavens and their end, and their plenitude, and all the armies and their marchings.",
        "40:3": "I have measured and described the stars, the great countless multitude (of them).",
        "40:4": "What man has seen their revolutions, and their entrances? For not even the angels see their number, while I have written all their names.",
        "40:5": "And I measured the sun’s circle, and measured its rays, counted the hours, I wrote down too all things that go over the earth, I have written the things that are nourished, and all seed sown and unsown, which the earth produces and all plants, and every grass and every flower, and their sweet smells, and their names, and the dwelling-places of the clouds, and their composition, and their wings, and how they bear rain and raindrops.",
        "40:6": "And I investigated all things, and wrote the road of the thunder and of the lightning, and they showed me the keys and their guardians, their rise, the way they go; it is let out (gently) in measure by a chain, lest by A heavy chain and violence it hurl down the angry clouds and destroy all things on earth.",
        "40:7": "I wrote the treasure-houses of the snow, and the store-houses of the cold and the frosty airs, and I observed their season’s key-holder, he fills the clouds with them, and does not exhaust the treasure-houses.",
        "40:8": "And I wrote the resting-places of the winds and observed and saw how their keyholders bear weighing-scales and measures; first, they put them in (one) weighing-scale, then in the other the weights and let them out according to measure cunningly over the whole earth, lest by heavy breathing they make the earth to rock.",
        "40:9": "And I measured out the whole earth, its mountains, and all hills, fields, trees, stones, rivers, all existing things I wrote down, the height from earth to the seventh heaven, and downwards to the very lowest hell, and the judgment-place, and the very great, open and weeping hell.",
        "40:10": "And I saw how the prisoners are in pain, expecting the limitless judgment.",

Therefore \"they run and return\" (Ezek. i. 14). \n[22c:6] And these arches of the Bow are more beautiful and radiant than the radiance of the sun during the summer solstice. And they are whiter than a flaming fire and they are great and beautiful. \n[22c:7] Above the arches of the Bow are the wheels of the 'Ophannim.

(i8) He has the \"Chariots of the 'Ophannim\", as it is written (Ezek. x. 12): \"and the 'Ophannim were full of eyes round about\".",
        "24:19": "He has the \"Chariots of His Holy Throne\", as it is written (Ps. xlvii. 8):\" God sitteth upon his holy throne \".",
        "24:20": "He has the \"chariots of the Throne of Yah\", as it is written (Ex. xvii. 16): \"Because a hand is lifted up upon the Throne of Jah\".",
        "24:21": "He has the \"Chariots of the Throne of Judgement\", as it is written (Is. v. 16): \"but the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment\".",
        "24:22": "He has the \"Chariots of the Throne of Glory\", as it is written (Jer. xvii. 12): \"The Throne of Glory, set on high from the beginning, is the place of our sanctuary\".",
        "24:23": "He has the \"Chariots of the High and Exalted Throne\", as it is written (Is. vi. i): \"I saw the Lord sitting upon the high and exalted throne\".",
        "25:1": "Above these there is one great prince, revered, high, lordly, fearful, ancient and strong. 'OPHAPHANNIEL H is his name.",
        "25:2": "He has sixteen faces, four faces on each side,(also) hundred wings on each side. And he has 8466 eyes, corresponding to the days of the year. [2190 –and some say 2116- on each side.] [2191 /2196 and sixteen on each side.]",
        "25:3": "And those two eyes of his face, in each one of them lightnings are flashing, and from each one of them firebrands are burning; and no creature is able to behold them: for anyone who looks at them is burnt instantly.",
        "25:4": "His height is (as) the distance of 2500 years' journey. No eye can behold and no mouth can tell the mighty power of his strength save the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, alone.",
        "25:5": "Why is he called 'OPHAPHANNIEL ? Because he is appointed over the 'Ophannim and the 'Ophannimare given in his charge. He stands every day and attends and beautifies them. And he exalts and orders their apartment and polishes their standing-place and makes bright their dwellings, makes their corners even and cleanses their seats. And he waits upon them early and late, by day and by night, to increase their beauty, to make great their dignity and to make them \"diligent in praise of their Creator.",
        "25:6": "And all the 'Ophannim are full of eyes, and they are all full of brightness; seventy two sapphire stones are fixed on their garments on their right side and seventy two sapphire stones are fixed on their garments on their left side.",
        "25:7": "And four carbuncle stones are fixed on the crown of every single one, the splendour of which proceeds in the four directions of 'Araboth even as the splendour of the globe of the sun proceeds in all the directions of the universe. And why is it called Carbuncle (Bareqet)? Because its splendour is like the appearance of a lightning (Baraq). And tents of splendour, tents of brilliance, tents of brightness as of sapphire and carbuncle inclose them because of the shining appearance of their eyes.",
        "26:1": "Above these there is one prince, wonderful, noble, great, honourable, mighty, terrible, a chief and leader 1 and a swift scribe, glorified, honoured and beloved.",
        "26:2": "He is altogether filled with splendour, full of praise and shining; and he is wholly full of brilliance, of light and of beauty; and the whole of him is filled with goodliness and greatness.",
        "26:3": "His countenance is altogether like (that of) angels, but his body is like an eagle's body.",
        "26:4": "His splendour is like unto lightnings, his appearance like fire brands, his beauty like unto sparks, his honour like fiery coals, his majesty like chashmals, his radiance like the light of the planet Venus.

        "26:5": "The sapphire stone upon his head is as great as the whole universe and like unto the splendour of the very heavens in radiance.",
        "26:6": "His body is full of eyes like the stars of the sky, innumerable and unsearchable. Every eye is like the planet Venus. Yet, there are some of them like the Lesser Light and some of them like unto the Greater Light. From his ankles to his knees (they are) like unto stars of lightning, from his knees to his thighs like unto the planet Venus, from his thighs to his loins like unto the moon, from his loins to his neck like the sun, from his neck to his skull like unto the Light Imperishable. (Cf. Zeph. iii. 5.)",
        "26:7": "The crown on his head is like unto the splendour of the Throne of Glory. The measure of the crown is the distance of 502 years' journey. There is no kind of splendour, no kind of brilliance, no kind of radiance, no kind of light in the universe but is fixed on that crown.",
        "26:8": "The name of that prince is SERAPHIEL H'. And the crown on his head, its name is \"the Prince of Peace\". And why is he called by the name of SERAPHIEL'? Because he is appointed over the Seraphim. And the flaming Seraphim are given in his charge. And he presides over them by day and by night and teaches them song, praise, proclamation of beauty, might and majesty; that they may proclaim the beauty of their King in all manner of Praise and Sanctification (Qedushsha).",
        "26:9": "How many are the Seraphim? Four, corresponding to the four winds of the world. And how many wings have they each one of them? Six, corresponding to the six days of Creation. And how many faces have they? Each one of them four faces.",
        "26:10": "The measure of the Seraphim and the height of each one of them correspond to the height of the seven heavens. The size of each wing is like the measure of all Raqia' . The size of each face is like that of the face of the East.",
        "26:11": "And each one of them gives forth light like unto the splendour of the Throne of Glory: so that not even the Holy Chayyoth, the honoured 'Ophannim, nor the majestic Kerubim are able to behold it. For everyone who beholds it, his eyes are darkened because of its great splendour.",
        "26:12": "Why are they called Seraphim? Because they burn (saraph) the writing tables of Satan: Every day Satan is sitting, together with SAMMAEL, the Prince of Rome, and with DUBBIEL, the Prince of Persia, and they write the iniquities of Israel on writing tables which they hand over to the Seraphim, in order that they may present them before the Holy One, blessed be He, so that He may destroy Israel from the world. But the Seraphim know from the secrets of the Holy One, blessed be He, that he desires not, that this people Israel should perish. What do the Seraphim? Every day do they receive (accept) them from the hand of Satan and burn them in the burning fire over against the high and exalted Throne in order that they may not come before the Holy One, blessed be He, at the time when he is sitting upon the Throne of Judgement, judging the whole world in truth.",
        "27:1": "Above the Seraphim there is one prince, exalted above all the princes, wondrous more than all the servants. His name is RADWERIEL H' who is appointed over the treasuries of the books.",
        "27:2": "He fetches forth the Case of Writings (with) the Book of Records in it, and brings it before the Holy One, blessed be He. And he breaks the seals of the case, opens it, takes out the books and delivers them before the Holy One, blessed be He. And the Holy One, blessed be He, receives them of his hand and gives them in his sight to the Scribes, that they may read them in the Great Beth Din (The court of justice) in the height of 'Araboth Raqia', before the heavenly household.",
        "27:3": "And why is he called RADWERIEL? Because out of every word that goes forth from his mouth an angel is created: and he stands in the songs (in the singing company) of the ministering angels and utters a song before the Holy One, blessed be He when the time draws nigh for the recitation of the (Thrice) Holy.",
        "28:1": "Above all these there are four great princes, Irin and Qaddishin by name: high, honoured, revered, beloved, wonderful and glorious ones, greater than all the children of heaven. There is none like unto them among all the celestial princes and none their equal among all the Servants. For each one of them is equal to all the rest together.",
        "28:2": "And their dwelling is over against the Throne of Glory, and their standing place over against the Holy One, blessed be He, so that the brilliance of their dwelling is a reflection of the brilliance of the Throne of Glory. And the splendour of their countenance is a reflection of the splendour of Shekina.",
        "28:3": "And they are glorified by the glory of the Divine Majesty (Gebura) and praised by (through) the praise of Shekina.",
        "28:4": "And not only that, but the Holy One, blessed be He, does nothing in his world without first consulting them, but after that he doeth it. As it is written (Dan. iv. 17): \"The sentence is by the decree of the 'Irin and the demand by the word of the Qaddishin.\"",
        "28:5": "The Irin are two and the Qaddishin are two. And how are they standing before the Holy One, blessed be He? It is to be understood, that one ‘Ir is standing on one side and the other ‘Ir on the other side, and one Qaddish is standing on one side and the other on the other side.",
        "28:6": "And ever do they exalt the humble, and they abase to the ground those that are proud, and they exalt to the height those that are humble.",
        "28:7": "And every day, as the Holy One, blessed be He, is sitting upon the Throne of Judgement and judges the whole world, and the Books of the Living and the Books of the Dead are opened before Him, then all the children of heaven are standing before him in fear, dread, awe and trembling. At that time, (when) the Holy One, blessed be He, is sitting upon the Throne of Judgement to execute judgement, his garment is white as snow, the hair on his head as pure wool and the whole of his cloak is like the shining light. And he is covered with righteousness all over as with a coat of mail.",
        "28:8": "And those 'Irin and Qaddishin are standing before him like court officers before the judge. And they raise and argue every case and close the case that comes before the Holy One, blessed be He, in judgement, according as it is written (Dan. iv. 17): \"The sentence is by the decree of the 'Irin and the demand by the word of the Qaddishin\"",
        "28:9": "Some of them argue and others pass the sentence in the Great Beth Din in 'Araboth. Some of them make the requests from before the Divine Majesty and some close the cases before the Most High. Others finish by going down and (confirming ) executing the sentences on earth below. According as it is written (Dan. iv. 13 , 14): \" Behold an 'Ir and a Qaddishcame down from heaven and cried aloud and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches\".",
        "28:10": "Why are they called 'Irin and Qaddishint (Watchers and Holy Ones)? By reason that they sanctify the body and the spirit with lashes of fire on the third day of the judgement, as it is written (Hos. vi. 2): \"After two days will he revive us: on the third he will raise us up, and we shall live before him.\"",
        "29:1": "Each one of them has seventy names corresponding to the seventy tongues of the world. And all of them are (based) upon the name of the Holy One, blessed be He. And every several name is written with a flaming style upon the Fearful Crown (Keiher Nora) which is on the head of the high and exalted King.",
        "29:2": "And from each one of them there go forth sparks and lightnings. And each one of them is beset with horns of splendour round about. From each one lights are shining forth, and each one is surrounded by tents of brilliance so that not even the Seraphim and the Chayyoth who are greater than all the children of heaven are able to behold them.",
        "30:1": "Whenever the Great Beth Din is seated in the 'Araboth Raqia' on high there is no opening of the mouth for anyone in the world save those great princes who are called H' by the name of the Holy One, blessed be He.",
        "30:2": "How many are those princes? Seventy-two princes of the kingdoms of the world besides the Prince of the World who speaks (pleads) in favour of the world before the Holy One, blessed be He, every day, at the hour when the book is opened in which are recorded all the doings of the world, according as it is written (Dan.vii.10): \"The judgement was set and the books were opened.\"",
        "31:1": "At the time when the Holy One, blessed be He, is sitting on the Throne, of Judgement, (then) Justice is standing on His right and Mercy on His left and Truth before His face.",
        "31:2": "And when man enters before Him to judgement, (then) there comes forth from the splendour of the Mercy towards him as (it were) a staff and stands in front of him. Forthwith man falls upon his face, (and) all the angels of destruction fear and tremble before him, according as it is written (Is.xvi. 5): \"And with mercy shall the throne be established, and he shall sit upon it in truth.\"",
        "32:1": "When the Holy One, blessed be He, opens the Book half of which is fire and half flame, (then) they go out from before Him in every moment to execute the judgement on the wicked by His sword (that is) drawn forth out of its sheath and the splendour of which shines like a lightning and pervades the world from one end to the other, as it is written (Is. Ixvi. 16): \"For by fire will the Lord plead (and by his sword with all flesh).\"",
        "32:2": "And all the inhabitants of the world (lit. those who come into the world) fear and tremble before Him, when they behold His sharpened sword like unto a lightning from one end of the world to the other, and sparks and flashes of the size of the stars of Raqia' going out from it; according as it is written (Deut. xxxii. 41): \"If I whet the lightning of my sword\".",
        "33:1": "At the time that the Holy One, blessed be He, is sitting on the Throne of Judgement, (then) the angels of Mercy are standing on His right, the angels of Peace are standing on His left and the angels of Destruction are standing in front of Him.",

        "33:3": "And the glorious Seraphim surround the Throne on its four sides with walls of lightnings, and the 'Ophannim surround them with fire-brands round about the Throne of Glory. And clouds of fire and clouds of flames compass them to the right and to the left; and the Holy Chayyoth carry the Throne of Glory from below: each one with three fingers. The measure of the fingers of each one is 800,000 and 700 times hundred, (and) 66,000 parasangs.",
        "33:4": "And underneath the feet of the Chayyoth seven fiery rivers are running and flowing. And the breadth of each river is 365 thousand parasangs and its depth is 248 thousand myriads of parasangs. Its length is unsearchable and immeasureable.",
        "33:5": "And each river turns round in a bow in the four directions of 'Araboth Raqict , and (from there) it falls down to Ma'on and is stayed, and from Ma1 on to Zebul, from Zebul to Shechaqim, from Shechaqim to Raqia' , from Raqia' to Shamayim and from Shamayim upon the heads of the wicked who are in Gehenna, as it is written (Jer. xxiii. 19): \"Behold a whirlwind of the Lord, even his fury, is gone, yea, a whirling tempest; it shall burst upon the head of the wicked\".",
        "34:1": "The hoofs of the Chayyoth are surrounded by seven clouds of burning coals. The clouds of burning coals are surrounded on the outside by seven walls of flame(s). The seven walls of flame(s) are surrounded on the outside by seven walls of hailstones (stones of 'Et-gabish, Ezek. xiii. 11,13, xxviii. 22). The hailstones are surrounded on the outside by stones of hail (stone of Barad). The stones of hail are surrounded on the outside by stones of \"the wings of the tempest \". The stones of \"the wings of the tempest\" are surrounded on the outside by flames of fire. The flames of fire are surrounded by the chambers of the whirlwind. The chambers of the whirlwind are surrounded on the outside by the fire and the water.",

Round about those who utter the \"Blessed\" are the bright clouds. The bright clouds are surrounded on the outside by coals of burning jumper; and on the outside surrounding the coals of burning juniper there are thousand camps of fire and ten thousand hosts of flame(s). And between every several camp and every several host there is a cloud, so that they may not be burnt by the fire.",
        "35:1": "506 thousand myriads of camps has the Holy One, blessed be He, in the height of 'Araboth Raqia. And each camp is (composed of) 496 thousand angels.",
        "35:2": "And every single angel, the height of his stature is as the great sea; and the appearance of their countenance as the appearance of the lightning, and their eyes as lamps of fire, and their arms and their feet like in colour to polished brass and the roaring voice of their words like the voice of a multitude.",

Then they are changed again into their former shape to have the fear of their King before them alway, as they have set their hearts on saying the Song continually, as it is written (Is. vi. 3): \"And one cried unto another and said (Holy, Holy, Holy, etc.)\".",

        "38:2": "by reason of the roaring voice of their chant, and the noise of their praise and the sparks and lightnings that go forth from their faces; as it is written (Ps. Ixxvii. 18): \"The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven (the lightnings lightened the world, the earth trembled and shook)\".",

The height of his stature, in the midst of all (who are) high of stature (I made) seventy thousand parasangs. I made his Throne great by the majesty of my Throne.

I called him the LESSER YHWH, the Prince of the Presence, the Knower of Secrets: for every secret did I reveal to him as a father and all mysteries declared I unto him in uprightness. \n[48c:8] I set up his throne at the door of my Hall that he may sit and judge the heavenly household on high. And I placed every prince before him, to receive authority from him, to perform his will. \n[48c:9] Seventy names did I take from (my) names and called him by them to enhance his glory. Seventy princes gave I into his hand, to command unto them my precepts and my words in every language: to abase by his word the proud to the ground, and to exalt by the utterance of his lips the humble to the height; to smite kings by his speech, to turn kings away from their paths, to set up(the) rulers over their dominion as it is written (Dan.ii. 21): \"and he changeth the times and the seasons, and to give wisdom unto all the setwise of the world and understanding (and) knowledge to all who understand knowledge, as it is griten (Dan. ii. 21): \" and knowledge to them that know understanding\", to reveal to them the secrets of my words and to teach the decree of my righteous judgement, \n[48c:10] as it is written (Is.Iv. n): “so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth; it shall not return unto me void but shall accomplish (that which I please)\". ‘E'eseh’ (I shall accomplish) is not written here, but \"asdh' (he shall accomplish), meaning, that whatever word and whatever utterance goes forth from before the Holy One, blessed be He, Metatron stands and carries it out. And he establishes the decrees of the Holy One, blessed be He. \n\n[48d:1] Seventy names has Metatron which the Holy One, blessed be He, took from his own name and put upon him.

Because all the treasuries of wisdom are committed in his hand. \n[48d:3] And all of them were opened to Moses on Sinai, so that he learnt them during the forty days, while he was standing (remaining}: the Torah in the seventy aspects of the seventy tongues, the Prophets in the seventy aspects of the seventy tongues, the Writings in the seventy aspects of the seventy tongues, 'the Halakas in the seventy aspects of the seventy tongues, the Traditions in the seventy aspects of the seventy tongues, the Haggadas in the seventy aspects of the seventy tongues and the Toseftas in the seventy aspects of the seventy tongues'. \n[48d:4] But as soon as the forty days were ended, he forgot all of them in one moment. Then the Holy One, blessed be He, called Yephiphyah, the Prince of the Law, and (through him) they were given to Moses as a gift. As it is written (Deut. x. 4): \"and the Lord gave them unto me\". And after that it remained with him. And whence do we know, that it remained (in his memory) ? Because it is written (Mai. iv. 4): \" Remember ye the Law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, even my statutes and judgements\". The Law of Moses': that is the Tora, the Prophets and the Writings, 'statutes': that is the Halakas and Traditions, 'judgements'; that is the Haggadas and the Toseftas. And all of them were given to Moses on high on Sinai. \n[48d:5] These seventy names (are) a reflection of the Explicit Name(s) on the Merkaba which are graven upon the Throne of Glory. For the Holy One, blessed be He, took from His Explicit Name(s) and put upon the name of Metatron: Seventy Names of His by which the ministering angels call the King of the kings of kings, blessed be He, in the high heavens, and twenty-two letters that are on the ring upon his finger with which are sealed the destinies of the princes of kingdoms on high in greatness and power and with which are sealed the lots of the Angel of Death, and the destinies of every nation and tongue. \n[48d:6] Said Metatron, the Angel, the Prince of the Presence; the Angel, the Prince of the Wisdom; the Angel, the Prince of the Understanding; the Angel, the Prince of the Kings; the Angel, the Prince of the Rulers; the angel, the Prince of the Glory; the angel, the Prince of the high ones, and of the princes, the exalted, great and honoured ones, in heaven and on earth: \n[48d:7] \"H, the God of Israel, is my witness in this thing, (that] when I revealed this secret to Moses, then all the hosts in every heaven on high raged against me and said to me: \n[48d:8] Why dost thou reveal this secret to son of man, born of woman, tainted and unclean, a man of a putrefying drop, the secret by which were created heaven and earth, the sea and the dry land, the mountains and hills, the rivers and springs, Gehenna of fire and hail, the Garden of Eden and the Tree of Life; and by which were formed Adam and Eve, and the cattle, and the wild beasts, and the fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and Behemoth and Leviathan, and the creeping things, the worms, the dragons of the sea, and the creeping things of the deserts; and the Tora and Wisdom and Knowledge and Thought and the Gnosis of things above and the fear of heaven. Why dost thou reveal this to flesh and blood? I answered them: Because the Holy One, blessed be He, has given me authority, And furthermore, I have obtained permission from the high and exalted Throne, from which all the Explicit Names go forth with lightnings of fire and flaming chashmallim. \n[48d:9] But they were not appeased, until the Holy One, blessed be He, rebuked them and drove them away with rebuke from before him, saying to them: \"I delight in, and have set my love on, and have entrusted and committed unto Metatron, my Servant, alone, for he is One (unique) among all the children of heaven. \n[48d:10] And Metatron brought them out from his house of treasuries and committed them to Moses, and Moses to Joshua, and Joshua to the elders, and the elders to the prophets and the prophets to the men of the Great Synagogue, and the men of the Great Synagogue to Ezra and Ezra the Scribe to Hillel the elder, and Hillel the elder to R. Abbahu and R. Abbahu to R. Zera, and R. Zera to the men of faith, and the men of faith (committed them) to give warning and to heal by them all diseases that rage in the world, as it is written (Ex. xv. 26): \"If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord, thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his eyes, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases upon thee, which I have put upon the Egyptians: for I am the Lord, that healeth thee\".

        "2:25": "He created heaven and earth and everything that He created in six days, and God made the seventh day holy, for all His works; therefore He commanded on its behalf that, whoever does any work thereon shall die, and that he who defiles it shall surely die.",
        "2:26": "Wherefore do thou command the children of Israel to observe this day that they may keep it holy and not do thereon any work, and not to defile it, as it is holier than all other days.",
        "2:27": "And whoever profanes it shall surely die, and whoever does thereon any work shall surely die eternally, that the children of Israel may observe this day throughout their generations, and not be rooted out of the land; for it is a holy day and a blessed day.",

        "2:29": "Declare and say to the children of Israel the law of this day both that they should keep Sabbath thereon, and that they should not forsake it in the error of their hearts; (and) that it is not lawful to do any work thereon which is unseemly, to do thereon their own pleasure, and that they should not prepare thereon anything to be eaten or drunk, and (that it is not lawful) to draw water, or bring in or take out thereon through their gates any burden, which they had not prepared for themselves on the sixth day in their dwellings.",
        "2:30": "And they shall not bring in nor take out from house to house on that day; for that day is more holy and blessed than any jubilee day of the jubilees; on this we kept Sabbath in the heavens before it was made known to any flesh to keep Sabbath thereon on the earth.",
        "2:31": "And the Creator of all things blessed it, but he did not sanctify all peoples and nations to keep Sabbath thereon, but Israel alone: them alone he permitted to eat and drink and to keep Sabbath thereon on the earth.",

        "3:5": "And the Lord our God caused a deep sleep to fall upon him, and he slept, and He took for the woman one rib from amongst his ribs, and this rib was the origin of the woman from amongst his ribs, and He built up the flesh in its stead, and built the woman.",
        "3:6": "And He awaked Adam out of his sleep and on awaking he rose on the sixth day, and He brought her to him, and he knew her, and said unto her: 'This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called [my] wife; because she was taken from her husband.'",
        "3:7": "Therefore shall man and wife be one and therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh.",
        "3:8": "In the first week was Adam created, and the rib -his wife: in the second week He showed her unto him: and for this reason the commandment was given to keep in their defilement, for a male seven days, and for a female twice seven days.",
        "3:9": "And after Adam had completed forty days in the land where he had been created, we brought him into the garden of Eden to till and keep it, but his wife they brought in on the eightieth day, and after this she entered into the garden of Eden.",
        "3:10": "And for this reason the commandment is written on the heavenly tablets in regard to her that gives birth: 'if she bears a male, she shall remain in her uncleanness seven days according to the first week of days, and thirty and three days shall she remain in the blood of her purifying, and she shall not touch any hallowed thing, nor enter into the sanctuary, until she accomplishes these days which (are enjoined) in the case of a male child.",
        "3:11": "But in the case of a female child she shall remain in her uncleanness two weeks of days, according to the first two weeks, and sixty-six days in the blood of her purification, and they will be in all eighty days.'",
        "3:12": "And when she had completed these eighty days we brought her into the garden of Eden, for it is holier than all the earth besides and every tree that is planted in it is holy.",
        "3:13": "Therefore, there was ordained regarding her who bears a male or a female child the statute of those days that she should touch no hallowed thing, nor enter into the sanctuary until these days for the male or female child are accomplished.",

        "3:16": "And he tilled (the garden), and was naked and knew it not, and was not ashamed, and he protected the garden from the birds and beasts and cattle, and gathered its fruit, and eat, and put aside the residue for himself and for his wife [and put aside that which was being kept].",
        "3:17": "And after the completion of the seven years, which he had completed there, seven years exactly, [8 A.M.] and in the second month, on the seventeenth day (of the month), the serpent came and approached the woman, and the serpent said to the woman, 'Hath God commanded you, saying, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?'",
        "3:18": "And she said to it, 'Of all the fruit of the trees of the garden God hath said unto us, Eat; but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God hath said unto us, 'Ye shall not eat thereof, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.'",
        "3:19": "And the serpent said unto the woman, 'Ye shall not surely die: for God doth know that on the day ye shall eat thereof, your eyes will be opened, and ye will be as gods, and ye will know good and evil.",

        "3:21": "And when she had first covered her shame with figleaves, she gave thereof to Adam and he eat, and his eyes were opened, and he saw that he was naked.",
        "3:22": "And he took figleaves and sewed (them) together, and made an apron for himself, and ,covered his shame.",
        "3:23": "And God cursed the serpent, and was wroth with it for ever . . .",
        "3:24": "And He was wroth with the woman, because she harkened to the voice of the serpent, and did eat; and He said unto her: 'I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy pains: in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children, and thy return shall be unto thy husband, and he will rule over thee.'",
        "3:25": "And to Adam also he said, ' Because thou hast harkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat thereof, cursed be the ground for thy sake: thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and thou shalt eat thy bread in the sweat of thy face, till thou returnest to the earth from whence thou wast taken; for earth thou art, and unto earth shalt thou return.'",
        "3:26": "And He made for them coats of skin, and clothed them, and sent them forth from the Garden of Eden.",
        "3:27": "And on that day on which Adam went forth from the Garden, he offered as a sweet savour an offering, frankincense, galbanum, and stacte, and spices in the morning with the rising of the sun from the day when he covered his shame.",
        "3:28": "And on that day was closed the mouth of all beasts, and of cattle, and of birds, and of whatever walks, and of whatever moves, so that they could no longer speak: for they had all spoken one with another with one lip and with one tongue.",
        "3:29": "And He sent out of the Garden of Eden all flesh that was in the Garden of Eden, and all flesh was scattered according to its kinds, and according to its types unto the places which had been created for them.",
        "3:30": "And to Adam alone did He give (the wherewithal) to cover his shame, of all the beasts and cattle.",
        "3:31": "On this account, it is prescribed on the heavenly tablets as touching all those who know the judgment of the law, that they should cover their shame, and should not uncover themselves as the Gentiles uncover themselves.",
        "3:32": "And on the new moon of the fourth month, Adam and his wife went forth from the Garden of Eden, and they dwelt in the land of Elda in the land of their creation.",
        "3:33": "And Adam called the name of his wife Eve.",

        "15:24": "And on the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and all the men of his house, <and those born in the house>, and all those, whom he had bought with money from the children of the stranger, were circumcised with him.",
        "15:25": "This law is for all the generations for ever, and there is no circumcision of the days, and no omission of one day out of the eight days; for it is an eternal ordinance, ordained and written on the heavenly tablets.",
        "15:26": "And every one that is born, the flesh of whose foreskin is not circumcised on the eighth day, belongs not to the children of the covenant which the Lord made with Abraham, but to the children of destruction; nor is there, moreover, any sign on him that he is the Lord's, but (he is destined) to be destroyed and slain from the earth, and to be rooted out of the earth, for he has broken the covenant of the Lord our God.",
        "15:27": "For all the angels of the presence and all the angels of sanctification have been so created from the day of their creation, and before the angels of the presence and the angels of sanctification He hath sanctified Israel, that they should be with Him and with His holy angels.",
        "15:28": "And do thou command the children of Israel and let them observe the sign of this covenant for their generations as an eternal ordinance, and they will not be rooted out of the land.",
        "15:29": "For the command is ordained for a covenant, that they should observe it for ever among all the children of Israel.",
        "15:30": "For Ishmael and his sons and his brothers and Esau, the Lord did not cause to approach Him, and he chose them not because they are the children of Abraham, because He knew them, but He chose Israel to be His people.",
        "15:31": "And He sanctified it, and gathered it from amongst all the children of men; for there are many nations and many peoples, and all are His, and over all hath He placed spirits in authority to lead them astray from Him.",
        "15:32": "But over Israel He did not appoint any angel or spirit, for He alone is their ruler, and He will preserve them and require them at the hand of His angels and His spirits, and at the hand of all His powers in order that He may preserve them and bless them, and that they may be His and He may be theirs from henceforth for ever.",
        "15:33": "And now I announce unto thee that the children of Israel will not keep true to this ordinance, and they will not circumcise their sons according to all this law; for in the flesh of their circumcision they will omit this circumcision of their sons, and all of them, sons of Beliar, will leave their sons uncircumcised as they were born.",
        "15:34": "And there will be great wrath from the Lord against the children of Israel. because they have forsaken His covenant and turned aside from His word, and provoked and blasphemed, inasmuch as they do not observe the ordinance of this law; for they have treated their members like the Gentiles, so that they may be removed and rooted out of the land. And there will no more be pardon or forgiveness unto them [so that there should be forgiveness and pardon] for all the sin of this eternal error.",
        "16:1": "And on the new moon of the fourth month we appeared unto Abraham, at the oak of Mamre, and we talked with him, and we announced to him that a son would be given to him by Sarah his wife.",
        "16:2": "And Sarah laughed, for she heard that we had spoken these words with Abraham, and we admonished her, and she became afraid, and denied that she had laughed on account of the words.",
        "16:3": "And we told her the name of her son, as his name is ordained and written in the heavenly tablets (i.e.) Isaac,",
        "16:4": "And (that) when we returned to her at a set time, she would have conceived a son.",
        "16:5": "And in this month the Lord executed his judgments on Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Zeboim, and all the region of the Jordan, and He burned them with fire and brimstone, and destroyed them until this day, even as [lo] I have declared unto thee all their works, that they are wicked and sinners exceedingly, and that they defile themselves and commit fornication in their flesh, and work uncleanness on the earth.",
        "16:6": "And, in like manner, God will execute judgment on the places where they have done according to the uncleanness of the Sodomites, like unto the judgment of Sodom.",
        "16:7": "But Lot we saved; for God remembered Abraham, and sent him out from the midst of the overthrow.",
        "16:8": "And he and his daughters committed sin upon the earth, such as had not been on the earth since the days of Adam till his time; for the man lay with his daughters.",
        "16:9": "And, behold, it was commanded and engraven concerning all his seed, on the heavenly tablets, to remove them and root them out, and to execute judgment upon them like the judgment of Sodom, and to leave no seed of the man on earth on the day of condemnation.",
        "16:10": "And in this month Abraham moved from Hebron, and departed and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur in the mountains of Gerar.",
        "16:11": "And in the middle of the fifth month he moved from thence, and dwelt at the Well of the Oath.",
        "16:12": "And in the middle of the sixth month the Lord visited Sarah and did unto her as He had spoken and she conceived.",
        "16:13": "And she bare a son in the third month, and in the middle of the month, at the time of which the Lord had spoken to Abraham, on the festival of the first fruits of the harvest, Isaac was born.",
        "16:14": "And Abraham circumcised his son on the eighth day: he was the first that was circumcised according to the covenant which is ordained for ever.",
        "16:15": "And in the sixth year of the fourth week we came to Abraham, to the Well of the Oath, and we appeared unto him [as we had told Sarah that we should return to her, and she would have conceived a son.",
        "16:16": "And we returned in the seventh month, and found Sarah with child before us] and we blessed him, and we announced to him all the things which had been decreed concerning him, that he should not die till he should beget six sons more, and should see (them) before he died; but (that) in Isaac should his name and seed be called:",
        "16:17": "And (that) all the seed of his sons should be Gentiles, and be reckoned with the Gentiles; but from the sons of Isaac one should become a holy seed, and should not be reckoned among the Gentiles.",
        "16:18": "For he should become the portion of the Most High, and all his seed had fallen into the possession of God, that it should be unto the Lord a people for (His) possession above all nations and that it should become a kingdom and priests and a holy nation.",
        "16:19": "And we went our way, and we announced to Sarah all that we had told him, and they both rejoiced with exceeding great joy.",
        "16:20": "And he built there an altar to the Lord who had delivered him, and who was making him rejoice in the land of his sojourning, and he celebrated a festival of joy in this month seven days, near the altar which he had built at the Well of the Oath.",
        "16:21": "And he built booths for himself and for his servants on this festival, and he was the first to celebrate the feast of tabernacles on the earth.",
        "16:22": "And during these seven days he brought each day to the altar a burnt offering to the Lord, two oxen, two rams, seven sheep, one he-goat, for a sin offering, that he might atone thereby for himself and for his seed.",
        "16:23": "And, as a thank-offering, seven rams, seven kids, seven sheep, and seven he-goats, and their fruit offerings and their drink offerings; and he burnt all the fat thereof on the altar, a chosen offering unto the Lord for a sweet smelling savour.",
        "16:24": "And morning and evening he burnt fragrant substances, frankincense and galbanum, and stackte, and nard, and myrrh, and spice, and costum; all these seven he offered, crushed, mixed together in equal parts (and) pure.",
        "16:25": "And he celebrated this feast during seven days, rejoicing with all his heart and with all his soul, he and all those who were in his house, and there was no stranger with him, nor any that was uncircumcised.",
        "16:26": "And he blessed his Creator who had created him in his generation, for He had created him according to His good pleasure; for He knew and perceived that from him would arise the plant of righteousness for the eternal generations, and from him a holy seed, so that it should become like Him who had made all things.",
        "16:27": "And he blessed and rejoiced, and he called the name of this festival the festival of the Lord, a joy acceptable to the Most High God.",

        "22:29": "And do not forsake him, nor set him at nought from henceforth unto the days of eternity, and may Thine eyes be opened upon him and upon his seed, that Thou mayst preserve him, and bless him, and mayest sanctify him as a nation for Thine inheritance;",
        "22:30": "And bless him with all Thy blessings from henceforth unto all the days of eternity, and renew Thy covenant and Thy grace with him and with his seed according to all Thy good pleasure unto all the generations of the earth.'",
        "23:1": "And he placed two fingers of Jacob on his eyes, and he blessed the God of gods, and he covered his face and stretched out his feet and slept the sleep of eternity, and was gathered to his fathers.",
        "23:2": "And notwithstanding all this Jacob was lying in his bosom, and knew not that Abraham, his father's father, was dead.",
        "23:3": "And Jacob awoke from his sleep, and behold Abraham was cold as ice, and he said 'Father, father'; but there was none that spake, and he knew that he was dead.",
        "23:4": "And he arose from his bosom and ran and told Rebecca, his mother; and Rebecca went to Isaac in the night, and told him; and they went together, and Jacob with them, and a lamp was in his hand, and when they had gone in they found Abraham lying dead.",
        "23:5": "And Isaac fell on the face of his father and wept and kissed him.",
        "23:6": "And the voices were heard in the house of Abraham, and Ishmael his son arose, and went to Abraham his father, and wept over Abraham his father, he and all the house of Abraham, and they wept with a great weeping.",
        "23:7": "And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the double cave, near Sarah his wife, and they wept for him forty days, all the men of his house, and Isaac and Ishmael, and all their sons, and all the sons of Keturah in their places; and the days of weeping for Abraham were ended.",
        "23:8": "And he lived three jubilees and four weeks of years, one hundred and seventy-five years, and completed the days of his life, being old and full of days.",
        "23:9": "For the days of the forefathers, of their life, were nineteen jubilees; and after the Flood they began to grow less than nineteen jubilees, and to decrease in jubilees, and to grow old quickly, and to be full of their days by reason of manifold tribulation and the wickedness of their ways, with the exception of Abraham.",
        "23:10": "For Abraham was perfect in all his deeds with the Lord, and well-pleasing in righteousness all the days of his life; and behold, he did not complete four jubilees in his life, when he had grown old by reason of the wickedness, and was full of his days.",
        "23:11": "And all the generations which shall arise from this time until the day of the great judgment shall grow old quickly, before they complete two jubilees, and their knowledge shall forsake them by reason of their old age Land all their know- ledge shall vanish away].",
        "23:12": "And in those days, if a man live a jubilee and a-half of years, they shall say regarding him: 'He has lived long, and the greater part of his days are pain and sorrow and tribulation, and there is no peace:",
        "23:13": "For calamity follows on calamity, and wound on wound, and tribulation on tribulation, and evil tidings on evil tidings, and illness on illness, and all evil judgments such as these, one with another, illness and overthrow, and snow and frost and ice, and fever, and chills, and torpor, and famine, and death, and sword, and captivity, and all kinds of calamities and pains.'",
        "23:14": "And all these shall come on an evil generation, which transgresses on the earth: their works are uncleanness and fornication, and pollution and abominations.",
        "23:15": "Then they shall say: 'The days of the forefathers were many (even), unto a thousand years, and were good; but behold, the days of our life, if a man has lived many, are three score years and ten, and, if he is strong, four score years, and those evil, and there is no peace in the days of this evil generation.'",
        "23:16": "And in that generation the sons shall convict their fathers and their elders of sin and unrighteousness, and of the words of their mouth and the great wickednesses which they perpetrate, and concerning their forsaking the covenant which the Lord made between them and Him, that they should observe and do all His commandments and His ordinances and all His laws, without departing either to the right hand or the left.",
        "23:17": "For all have done evil, and every mouth speaks iniquity and all their works are an uncleanness and an abomination, and all their ways are pollution, uncleanness and destruction.",
        "23:18": "Behold the earth shall be destroyed on account of all their works, and there shall be no seed of the vine, and no oil; for their works are altogether faithless, and they shall all perish together, beasts and cattle and birds, and all the fish of the sea, on account of the children of men.",
        "23:19": "And they shall strive one with another, the young with the old, and the old with the young, the poor with the rich, the lowly with the great, and the beggar with the prince, on account of the law and the covenant; for they have forgotten commandment, and covenant, and feasts, and months, and Sabbaths, and jubilees, and all judgments.",
        "23:20": "And they shall stand <with bows and> swords and war to turn them back into the way; but they shall not return until much blood has been shed on the earth, one by another.",
        "23:21": "And those who have escaped shall not return from their wickedness to the way of righteousness, but they shall all exalt themselves to deceit and wealth, that they may each take all that is his neighbour's, and they shall name the great name, but not in truth and not in righteousness, and they shall defile the holy of holies with their uncleanness and the corruption of their pollution.",
        "23:22": "And a great punishment shall befall the deeds of this generation from the Lord, and He will give them over to the sword and to judgment and to captivity, and to be plundered and devoured.",
        "23:23": "And He will wake up against them the sinners of the Gentiles, who have neither mercy nor compassion, and who shall respect the person of none, neither old nor young, nor any one, for they are more wicked and strong to do evil than all the children of men. And they shall use violence against Israel and transgression against Jacob, And much blood shall be shed upon the earth, And there shall be none to gather and none to bury.",
        "23:24": "In those days they shall cry aloud, And call and pray that they may be saved from the hand of the sinners, the Gentiles; But none shall be saved.",
        "23:25": "And the heads of the children shall be white with grey hair, And a child of three weeks shall appear old like a man of one hundred years, And their stature shall be destroyed by tribulation and oppression.",
        "23:26": "And in those days the children shall begin to study the laws, And to seek the commandments, And to return to the path of righteousness.",
        "23:27": "And the days shall begin to grow many and increase amongst those children of men Till their days draw nigh to one thousand years. And to a greater number of years than (before) was the number of the days.",
        "23:28": "And there shall be no old man Nor one who is <not> satisfied with his days, For all shall be (as) children and youths.",
        "23:29": "And all their days they shall complete and live in peace and in joy, And there shall be no Satan nor any evil destroyer; For all their days shall be days of blessing and healing.",
        "23:30": "And at that time the Lord will heal His servants, And they shall rise up and see great peace, And drive out their adversaries. And the righteous shall see and be thankful, And rejoice with joy for ever and ever, And shall see all their judgments and all their curses on their enemies.",
        "23:31": "And their bones shall rest in the earth, And their spirits shall have much joy, And they shall know that it is the Lord who executes judgment, And shows mercy to hundreds and thousands and to all that love Him",
        "23:32": "And do thou, Moses, write down these words; for thus are they written, and they record (them) on the heavenly tablets for a testimony for the generations for ever.",
        "24:1": "And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that the Lord blessed Isaac his son, and he arose from Hebron and went and dwelt at the Well of the Vision in the first year of the third week [2073 A.M.] of this jubilee, seven years.",
        "24:2": "And in the first year of the fourth week a famine began in the land, [2080 A.M.] besides the first famine, which had been in the days of Abraham.",
        "24:3": "And Jacob sod lentil pottage, and Esau came from the field hungry. And he said to Jacob his brother: 'Give me of this red pottage.' And Jacob said to him: 'Sell to me thy [primogeniture, this] birthright and I will give thee bread, and also some of this lentil pottage.'",
        "24:4": "And Esau said in his heart: 'I shall die; of what profit to me is this birthright?",
        "24:5": "'And he said to Jacob: 'I give it to thee.' And Jacob said: 'Swear to me, this day,' and he sware unto him.",
        "24:6": "And Jacob gave his brother Esau bread and pottage, and he eat till he was satisfied, and Esau despised his birthright; for this reason was Esau's name called Edom, on account of the red pottage which Jacob gave him for his birthright.",
        "24:7": "And Jacob became the elder, and Esau was brought down from his dignity.",
        "24:8": "And the famine was over the land, and Isaac departed to go down into Egypt in the second year of this week, and went to the king of the Philistines to Gerar, unto Abimelech.",
        "24:9": "And the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him: 'Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land that I shall tell thee of, and sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee and bless thee.",
        "24:10": "For to thee and to thy seed will I give all this land, and I will establish My oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father, and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all this land.",
        "24:11": "And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thy father obeyed My voice, and kept My charge and My commandments, and My laws, and My ordinances, and My covenant; and now obey My voice and dwell in this land.'",
        "24:12": "And he dwelt in Gelar three weeks of years.",
        "24:13": "And Abimelech charged concerning him, [2080-2101 A.M.] and concerning all that was his, saying: 'Any man that shall touch him or aught that is his shall surely die.'",
        "24:14": "And Isaac waxed strong among the Philistines, and he got many possessions, oxen and sheep and camels and asses and a great household.",
        "24:15": "And he sowed in the land of the Philistines and brought in a hundred-fold, and Isaac became exceedingly great, and the Philistines envied him.",
        "24:16": "Now all the wells which the servants of Abraham had dug during the life of Abraham, the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham, and filled them with earth.",
        "24:17": "And Abimelech said unto Isaac: 'Go from us, for thou art much mightier than we', and Isaac departed thence in the first year of the seventh week, and sojourned in the valleys of Gerar.",
        "24:18": "And they digged again the wells of water which the servants of Abraham, his father, had digged, and which the Philistines had closed after the death of Abraham his father, and he called their names as Abraham his father had named them.",
        "24:19": "And the servants of Isaac dug a well in the valley, and found living water, and the shepherds of Gerar strove with the shepherds of Isaac, saying: 'The water is ours'; and Isaac called the name of the well 'Perversity', because they had been perverse with us.",
        "24:20": "And they dug a second well, and they strove for that also, and he called its name 'Enmity'. And he arose from thence and they digged another well, and for that they strove not, and he called the name of it 'Room', and Isaac said: 'Now the Lord hath made room for us, and we have increased in the land.'",
        "24:21": "And he went up from thence to the Well of the Oath in the first year of the first week in the [2108 A.M.] forty-fourth jubilee.",
        "24:22": "And the Lord appeared to him that night, on the new moon of the first month, and said unto him: 'I am the God of Abraham thy father; fear not, for I am with thee, and shall bless thee and shall surely multiply thy seed as the sand of the earth, for the sake of Abraham my servant.'",
        "24:23": "And he built an altar there, which Abraham his father had first built, and he called upon the name of the Lord, and he offered sacrifice to the God of Abraham his father.",
        "24:24": "And they digged a well and they found living water.",
        "24:25": "And the servants of Isaac digged another well and did not find water, and they went and told Isaac that they had not found water, and Isaac said: 'I have sworn this day to the Philistines and this thing has been announced to us.'",
        "24:26": "And he called the name of that place the Well of the Oath; for there he had sworn to Abimelech and Ahuzzath his friend and Phicol the prefect Or his host.",
        "24:27": "And Isaac knew that day that under constraint he had sworn to them to make peace with them.",
        "24:28": "And Isaac on that day cursed the Philistines and said: 'Cursed be the Philistines unto the day of wrath and indignation from the midst of all nations; may God make them a derision and a curse and an object of wrath and indignation in the hands of the sinners the Gentiles and in the hands of the Kittim.",
        "24:29": "And whoever escapes the sword of the enemy and the Kittim, may the righteous nation root out in judgment from under heaven; for they shall be the enemies and foes of my children throughout their generations upon the earth.",
        "24:30": "And no remnant shall be left to them, Nor one that shall be saved on the day of the wrath of judgment; For destruction and rooting out and expulsion from the earth is the whole seed of the Philistines (reserved), And there shall no longer be left for these Caphtorim a name or a seed on the earth.",
        "24:31": "For though he ascend unto heaven, Thence shall he be brought down, And though he make himself strong on earth, Thence shall he be dragged forth, And though he hide himself amongst the nations, Even from thence shall he be rooted out; And though he descend into Sheol, There also shall his condemnation be great, And there also he shall have no peace.",
        "24:32": "And if he go into captivity, By the hands of those that seek his life shall they slay him on the way, And neither name nor seed shall be left to him on all the earth; For into eternal malediction shall he depart.'",
        "24:33": "And thus is it written and engraved concerning him on the heavenly tablets, to do unto him on the day of judgment, so that he may be rooted out of the earth.",
        "25:1": "And in the second year of this week in this jubilee, Rebecca called Jacob her son, and spake unto [2109 A.M.] him, saying: 'My son, do not take thee a wife of the daughters of Canaan, as Esau, thy brother, who took him two wives of the daughters of Canaan, and they have embittered my soul with all their unclean deeds: for all their deeds are fornication and lust, and there is no righteousness with them, for (their deeds) are evil.",
        "25:2": "And I, my son, love thee exceedingly, and my heart and my affection bless thee every hour of the day and watch of the night.",
        "25:3": "And now, my son, hearken to my voice, and do the will of thy mother, and do not take thee a wife of the daughters of this land, but only of the house of my father, and of my father's kindred. Thou shalt take thee a wife of the house of my father, and the Most High God will bless thee, and thy children shall be a righteous generation and a holy seed.'",
        "25:4": "And then spake Jacob to Rebecca, his mother, and said unto her: 'Behold, mother, I am nine weeks of years old, and I neither know nor have I touched any woman, nor have I betrothed myself to any, nor even think of taking me a wife of the daughters of Canaan.",
        "25:5": "For I remember, mother, the words of Abraham, our father, for he commanded me not to take a wife of the daughters of Canaan, but to take me a wife from the seed of my father's house and from my kindred.",
        "25:6": "I have heard before that daughters have been born to Laban, thy brother, and I have set my heart on them to take a wife from amongst them.",
        "25:7": "And for this reason I have guarded myself in my spirit against sinning or being corrupted in all my ways throughout all the days of my life; for with regard to lust and fornication, Abraham, my father, gave me many commands.",
        "25:8": "And, despite all that he has commanded me, these two and twenty years my brother has striven with me, and spoken frequently to me and said: 'My brother, take to wife a sister of my two wives'; but I refuse to do as he has done.",
        "25:9": "I swear before thee, mother, that all the days of my life I will not take me a wife from the daughters of the seed of Canaan, and I will not act wickedly as my brother has done.",
        "25:10": "Fear not, mother; be assured that I shall do thy will and walk in uprightness, and not corrupt my ways for ever.'",
        "25:11": "And thereupon she lifted up her face to heaven and extended the fingers of her hands, and opened her mouth and blessed the Most High God, who had created the heaven and the earth, and she gave Him thanks and praise.",
        "25:12": "And she said: 'Blessed be the Lord God, and may His holy name be blessed for ever and ever, who has given me Jacob as a pure son and a holy seed; for he is Thine, and Thine shall his seed be continually and throughout all the generations for evermore.",
        "25:13": "Bless him, O Lord, and place in my mouth the blessing of righteousness, that I may bless him.'",
        "25:14": "And at that hour, when the spirit of righteousness descended into her mouth, she placed both her hands on the head of Jacob, and said:",
        "25:15": "'Blessed art thou, Lord of righteousness and God of the ages And may He bless thee beyond all the generations of men. May He give thee, my Son, the path of righteousness, And reveal righteousness to thy seed.",
        "25:16": "And may He make thy sons many during thy life, And may they arise according to the number of the months of the year. And may their sons become many and great beyond the stars of heaven, And their numbers be more than the sand of the sea.",
        "25:17": "And may He give them this goodly land -as He said He would give it to Abraham and to his seed after him alway- And may they hold it as a possession for ever.",
        "25:18": "And may I see (born) unto thee, my son, blessed children during my life, And a blessed and holy seed may all thy seed be.",
        "25:19": "And as thou hast refreshed thy mother's spirit during her life, The womb of her that bare thee blesses thee thus, [My affection] and my breasts bless thee And my mouth and my tongue praise thee greatly.",
        "25:20": "Increase and spread over the earth, And may thy seed be perfect in the joy of heaven and earth for ever; And may thy seed rejoice, And on the great day of peace may it have peace.",
        "25:21": "And may thy name and thy seed endure to all the ages, And may the Most High God be their God, And may the God of righteousness dwell with them, And by them may His sanctuary be built unto all the ages.",
        "25:22": "Blessed be he that blesseth thee, And all flesh that curseth thee falsely, may it be cursed.'",
        "25:23": "And she kissed him, and said to him; 'May the Lord of the world love thee As the heart of thy mother and her affection rejoice in thee and bless thee.' And she ceased from blessing.",
        "26:1": "And in the seventh year of this week Isaac called Esau, his elder Son, and said unto him: ' I am [2114 A.M.] old, my son, and behold my eyes are dim in seeing, and I know not the day of my death.",
        "26:2": "And now take thy hunting weapons thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and hunt and catch me (venison), my son, and make me savoury meat, such as my soul loveth, and bring it to me that I may eat, and that my soul may bless thee before I die.'",
        "26:3": "But Rebecca heard Isaac speaking to Esau.",
        "26:4": "And Esau went forth early to the field to hunt and catch and bring home to his father.",
        "26:5": "And Rebecca called Jacob, her son, and said unto him: 'Behold, I heard Isaac, thy father, speak unto Esau, thy brother, saying: \"Hunt for me, and make me savoury meat, and bring (it) to me that",
        "26:6": "I may eat and bless thee before the Lord before I die.\" And now, my son, obey my voice in that which I command thee: Go to thy flock and fetch me two good kids of the goats, and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loves, and thou shalt bring (it) to thy father that he may eat and bless thee before the Lord before he die, and that thou mayst be blessed.'",
        "26:7": "And Jacob said to Rebecca his mother: 'Mother, I shall not withhold anything which my father would eat, and which would please him: only I fear, my mother, that he will recognise my voice and wish to touch me.",
        "26:8": "And thou knowest that I am smooth, and Esau, my brother, is hairy, and I shall appear before his eyes as an evildoer, and shall do a deed which he had not commanded me, and he will be wroth with me, and I shall bring upon myself a curse, and not a blessing.'",
        "26:9": "And Rebecca, his mother, said unto him: 'Upon me be thy curse, my son, only obey my voice.'",
        "26:10": "And Jacob obeyed the voice of Rebecca, his mother, and went and fetched two good and fat kids of the goats, and brought them to his mother, and his mother made them ~savoury meat~ such as he loved.",
        "26:11": "And Rebecca took the goodly rainment of Esau, her elder son, which was with her in the house, and she clothed Jacob, her younger son, (with them), and she put the skins of the kids upon his hands and on the exposed parts of his neck.",
        "26:12": "And she gave the meat and the bread which she had prepared into the hand of her son Jacob.",
        "26:13": "And Jacob went in to his father and said: 'I am thy son: I have done according as thou badest me: arise and sit and eat of that which I have caught, father, that thy soul may bless me.'",
        "26:14": "And Isaac said to his son: 'How hast thou found so quickly, my son?",
        "26:15": "'And Jacob said: 'Because <the Lord> thy God caused me to find.'",
        "26:16": "And Isaac said unto him: 'Come near, that I may feel thee, my son, if thou art my son Esau or not.'",
        "26:17": "And Jacob went near to Isaac, his father, and he felt him and said: 'The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau,'",
        "26:18": "and he discerned him not, because it was a dispensation from heaven to remove his power of perception and Isaac discerned not, for his hands were hairy as his brother Esau's, so that he blessed him.",
        "26:19": "And he said: 'Art thou my son Esau? ' and he said: 'I am thy son': and he said, 'Bring near to me that I may eat of that which thou hast caught, my son, that my soul may bless thee.'",
        "26:20": "And he brought near to him, and he did eat, and he brought him wine and he drank.",

        "26:22": "And he came near and kissed him. And he smelled the smell of his raiment, and he blessed him and said: 'Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of a <full> field which the Lord hath blessed.",
        "26:23": "And may the Lord give thee of the dew of heaven And of the dew of the earth, and plenty of corn and oil: Let nations serve thee, And peoples bow down to thee.",
        "26:24": "Be lord over thy brethren, And let thy mother's sons bow down to thee; And may all the blessings wherewith the Lord hath blessed me and blessed Abraham, my father; Be imparted to thee and to thy seed for ever: Cursed be he that curseth thee, And blessed be he that blesseth thee.'",
        "26:25": "And it came to pass as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing his son Jacob, and Jacob had gone forth from Isaac his father he hid himself and Esau, his brother, came in from his hunting.",
        "26:26": "And he also made savoury meat, and brought (it) to his father, and said unto his father: 'Let my father arise, and eat of my venison that thy soul may bless me.'",

        "26:28": "And Isaac was very greatly astonished, and said: 'Who is he that hath hunted and caught and brought (it) to me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him: (and) he shall be blessed, and all his seed for ever.'",
        "26:29": "And it came to pass when Esau heard the words of his father Isaac that he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry, and said unto his father: 'Bless me, (even) me also, father.'",
        "26:30": "And he said unto him: 'Thy brother came with guile, and hath taken away thy blessing.' And he said: 'Now I know why his name is named Jacob: behold, he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birth-right, and now he hath taken away my blessing.'",
        "26:31": "And he said: 'Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me, father?' and Isaac answered and said unto Esau: 'Behold, I have made him thy lord, And all his brethren have I given to him for servants, And with plenty of corn and wine and oil have I strengthened him: And what now shall I do for thee, my son?'",
        "26:32": "And Esau said to Isaac, his father: 'Hast thou but one blessing, O father? Bless me, (even) me also, father: '",

        "27:4": "And Jacob said: 'I am not afraid; if he wishes to kill me, I will kill him.'",
        "27:5": "But she said unto him: 'Let me not be bereft of both my sons on one day.'",
        "27:6": "And Jacob said to Rebecca his mother: 'Behold, thou knowest that my father has become old, and does not see because his eyes are dull, and if I leave him it will be evil in his eyes, because I leave him and go away from you, and my father will be angry, and will curse me. I will not go; when he sends me, then only will I go.'",
        "27:7": "And Rebecca said to Jacob: 'I will go in and speak to him, and he will send thee away.'",
        "27:8": "And Rebecca went in and said to Isaac: 'I loathe my life because of the two daughters of Heth, whom Esau has taken him as wives; and if Jacob take a wife from among the daughters of the land such as these, for what purpose do I further live, for the daughters of Canaan are evil.'",
        "27:9": "And Isaac called Jacob and blessed him, and admonished him and said unto him: 'Do not take thee a wife of any of the daughters of Canaan;",

        "27:22": "And he spake to Jacob and said: 'I am the Lord God of Abraham, thy father, and the God of Isaac; the land whereon thou art sleeping, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed after thee.",
        "27:23": "And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt increase to the west and to the east, to the north and the south, and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the nations be blessed.",
        "27:24": "And behold, I will be with thee, and will keep thee whithersoever thou goest, and I will bring thee again into this land in peace; for I will not leave thee until I do everything that I told thee of.'",
        "27:25": "And Jacob awoke from his sleep, and said, 'Truly this place is the house of the Lord, and I knew it not.' And he was afraid and said: 'Dreadful is this place which is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.'",
        "27:26": "And Jacob arose early in the morning, and took the stone which he had put under his head and set it up as a pillar for a sign, and he poured oil upon the top of it. And he called the name of that place Bethel; but the name of the place was Luz at the first.",
        "27:27": "And Jacob vowed a vow unto the Lord, saying: 'If the Lord will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and give me bread to eat and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my father's house in peace, then shall the Lord be my God, and this stone which I have set up as a pillar for a sign in this place, shall be the Lord's house, and of all that thou givest me, I shall give the tenth to thee, my God.'",
        "28:1": "And he went on his journey, and came to the land of the east, to Laban, the brother of Rebecca, and he was with him, and served him for Rachel his daughter one week.",
        "28:2": "And in the first year of the third week [2122 A.M.] he said unto him: 'Give me my wife, for whom I have served thee seven years '; and Laban said unto Jacob: 'I will give thee thy wife.'",
        "28:3": "And Laban made a feast, and took Leah his elder daughter, and gave (her) to Jacob as a wife, and gave her Zilpah his handmaid for an hand- maid; and Jacob did not know, for he thought that she was Rachel.",
        "28:4": "And he went in unto her, and behold, she was Leah; and Jacob was angry with Laban, and said unto him: 'Why hast thou dealt thus with me? Did not I serve thee for Rachel and not for Leah? Why hast thou wronged me?",
        "28:5": "Take thy daughter, and I will go; for thou hast done evil to me.' For Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah; for Leah's eyes were weak, but her form was very handsome; but Rachel had beautiful eyes and a beautiful and very handsome form.",
        "28:6": "And Laban said to Jacob: 'It is not so done in our country, to give the younger before the elder.' And it is not right to do this; for thus it is ordained and written in the heavenly tablets, that no one should give his younger daughter before the elder; but the elder, one gives first and after her the younger -and the man who does so, they set down guilt against him in heaven, and none is righteous that does this thing, for this deed is evil before the Lord.",
        "28:7": "And command thou the children of Israel that they do not this thing; let them neither take nor give the younger before they have given the elder, for it is very wicked.",
        "28:8": "And Laban said to Jacob: 'Let the seven days of the feast of this one pass by, and I shall give thee Rachel, that thou mayst serve me another seven years, that thou mayst pasture my sheep as thou didst in the former week.'",
        "28:9": "And on the day when the seven days of the feast of Leah had passed, Laban gave Rachel to Jacob, that he might serve him another seven years, and he gave to Rachel Bilhah, the sister of Zilpah, as a handmaid.",
        "28:10": "And he served yet other seven years for Rachel, for Leah had been given to him for nothing.",
        "28:11": "And the Lord opened the womb of Leah, and she conceived and bare Jacob a son, and he called his name Reuben, on the fourteenth day of the ninth month, in the first year of the third week. [2122 A.M.]",
        "28:12": "But the womb of Rachel was closed, for the Lord saw that Leah was hated and Rachel loved.",
        "28:13": "And again Jacob went in unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob a second son, and he called his name Simeon, on the twenty-first of the tenth month, and in the third year of this week. [2124 A.M.]",
        "28:14": "And again Jacob went in unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare him a third son, and he called his name Levi, in the new moon of the first month in the sixth year of this week. [2127 A.M.]",

        "28:19": "And Jacob went in again unto Bilhah a second time, and she conceived, and bare Jacob another son, and Rachel called his name Napthali, on the fifth of the seventh month, in the second year of the fourth week. [2130 A.M.]",
        "28:20": "And when Leah saw that she had become sterile and did not bear, she envied Rachel, and she also gave her handmaid Zilpah to Jacob to wife, and she conceived, and bare a son, and Leah called his name Gad, on the twelfth of the eighth month, in the third year of the fourth week. [2131 A.M.]",
        "28:21": "And he went in again unto her, and she conceived, and bare him a second son, and Leah called his name Asher, on the second of the eleventh month, in the fifth year of the fourth week. [2133 A.M.]",

        "28:24": "And the Lord was gracious to Rachel, and opened her womb, and she conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Joseph, on the new moon of the fourth month, in the sixth year in this fourth week. [2134 A.M.]",
        "28:25": "And in the days when Joseph was born, Jacob said to Laban: 'Give me my wives and sons, and let me go to my father Isaac, and let me make me an house; for I have completed the years in which I have served thee for thy two daughters, and I will go to the house of my father.'",
        "28:26": "And Laban said to Jacob: 'Tarry with me for thy wages, and pasture my flock for me again, and take thy wages.'",
        "28:27": "And they agreed with one another that he should give him as his wages those of the lambs and kids which were born black and spotted and white, (these) were to be his wages.",
        "28:28": "And all the sheep brought forth spotted and speckled and black, variously marked, and they brought forth again lambs like themselves, and all that were spotted were Jacob's and those which were not were Laban's.",

        "29:2": "And Jacob saw that Laban was going to shear his sheep, and Jacob called Leah and Rachel, and spake kindly unto them that they should come with him to the land of Canaan.",
        "29:3": "For he told them how he had seen everything in a dream, even all that He had spoken unto him that he should return to his father's house, and they said: 'To every place whither thou goest we will go with thee.'",
        "29:4": "And Jacob blessed the God of Isaac his father, and the God of Abraham his father's father, and he arose and mounted his wives and his children, and took all his possessions and crossed the river, and came to the land of Gilead, and Jacob hid his intention from Laban and told him not.",
        "29:5": "And in the seventh year of the fourth week Jacob turned (his face) toward Gilead in the first month, on the twenty-first thereof. [2135 A.M.] And Laban pursued after him and overtook Jacob in the mountain of Gilead in the third month, on the thirteenth thereof.",
        "29:6": "And the Lord did not suffer him to injure Jacob; for he appeared to him in a dream by night. And Laban spake to Jacob.",
        "29:7": "And on the fifteenth of those days Jacob made a feast for Laban, and for all who came with him, and Jacob sware to Laban that day, and Laban also to Jacob, that neither should cross the mountain of Gilead to the other with evil purpose.",
        "29:8": "And he made there a heap for a witness; wherefore the name of that place is called: 'The Heap of Witness,' after this heap.",
        "29:9": "But before they used to call the land of Gilead the land of the Rephaim; for it was the land of the Rephaim, and the Rephaim were born (there), giants whose height was ten, nine, eight down to seven cubits.",

        "29:17": "For Isaac had returned from the Well of the Oath and gone up to the tower of his father Abraham, and he dwelt there apart from his son Esau.",
        "29:18": "For in the days when Jacob went to Mesopotamia, Esau took to himself a wife Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael, and he gathered together all the flocks of his father and his wives, and went Up and dwelt on Mount Seir, and left Isaac his father at the Well of the Oath alone.",
        "29:19": "And Isaac went up from the Well of the Oath and dwelt in the tower of Abraham his father on the mountains of Hebron,",
        "29:20": "And thither Jacob sent all that he did send to his father and his mother from time to time, all they needed, and they blessed Jacob with all their heart and with all their soul.",
        "30:1": "And in the first year of the sixth week [2143 A.M.] he went up to Salem, to the east of Shechem, in peace, in the fourth month.",
        "30:2": "And there they carried off Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, into the house of Shechem, the son of Hamor, the Hivite, the prince of the land, and he lay with her and defiled her, and she was a little girl, a child of twelve years.",
        "30:3": "And he besought his father and her brothers that she might be given to him to wife. And Jacob and his sons were wroth because of the men of Shechem; for they had defiled Dinah, their sister, and they spake to them with evil intent and dealt deceitfully with them and beguiled them.",
        "30:4": "And Simeon and Levi came unexpectedly to Shechem and executed judgment on all the men of Shechem, and slew all the men whom they found in it, and left not a single one remaining in it: they slew all in torments because they had dishonoured their sister Dinah.",
        "30:5": "And thus let it not again be done from henceforth that a daughter of Israel be defiled; for judgment is ordained in heaven against them that they should destroy with the sword all the men of the Shechemites because they had wrought shame in Israel.",
        "30:6": "And the Lord delivered them into the hands of the sons of Jacob that they might exterminate them with the sword and execute judgment upon them, and that it might not thus again be done in Israel that a virgin of Israel should be defiled.",
        "30:7": "And if there is any man who wishes in Israel to give his daughter or his sister to any man who is of the seed of the Gentiles he shall surely die, and they shall stone him with stones; for he hath wrought shame in Israel; and they shall burn the woman with fire, because she has dishonoured the name of the house of her father, and she shall be rooted out of Israel.",
        "30:8": "And let not an adulteress and no uncleanness be found in Israel throughout all the days of the generations of the earth; for Israel is holy unto the Lord, and every man who has defiled (it) shall surely die: they shall stone him with stones.",
        "30:9": "For thus has it been ordained and written in the heavenly tablets regarding all the seed of Israel: he who defileth (it) shall surely die, and he shall be stoned with stones.",
        "30:10": "And to this law there is no limit of days, and no remission, nor any atonement: but the man who has defiled his daughter shall be rooted out in the midst of all Israel, because he has given of his seed to Moloch, and wrought impiously so as to defile it.",
        "30:11": "And do thou, Moses, command the children of Israel and exhort them not to give their daughters to the Gentiles, and not to take for their sons any of the daughters of the Gentiles, for this is abominable before the Lord.",
        "30:12": "For this reason I have written for thee in the words of the Law all the deeds of the Shechemites, which they wrought against Dinah, and how the sons of Jacob spake, saying: 'We will not give our daughter to a man who is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us.'",
        "30:13": "And it is a reproach to Israel, to those who live, and to those that take the daughters of the Gentiles; for this is unclean and abominable to Israel.",
        "30:14": "And Israel will not be free from this uncleanness if it has a wife of the daughters of the Gentiles, or has given any of its daughters to a man who is of any of the Gentiles.",
        "30:15": "For there will be plague upon plague, and curse upon curse, and every judgment and plague and curse will come upon him: if he do this thing, or hide his eyes from those who commit uncleanness, or those who defile the sanctuary of the Lord, or those who profane His holy name, (then) will the whole nation together be judged for all the uncleanness and profanation of this man.",
        "30:16": "And there will be no respect of persons [and no consideration of persons] and no receiving at his hands of fruits and offerings and burnt-offerings and fat, nor the fragrance of sweet savour, so as to accept it: and so fare every man or woman in Israel who defiles the sanctuary.",
        "30:17": "For this reason I have commanded thee, saying: 'Testify this testimony to Israel: see how the Shechemites fared and their sons: how they were delivered into the hands of two sons of Jacob, and they slew them under tortures, and it was (reckoned) unto them for righteousness, and it is written down to them for righteousness.",
        "30:18": "And the seed of Levi was chosen for the priesthood, and to be Levites, that they might minister before the Lord, as we, continually, and that Levi and his sons may be blessed for ever; for he was zealous to execute righteousness and judgment and vengeance on all those who arose against Israel.",
        "30:19": "And so they inscribe as a testimony in his favour on the heavenly tablets blessing and righteousness before the God of all:",
        "30:20": "And we remember the righteousness which the man fulfilled during his life, at all periods of the year; until a thousand generations they will record it, and it will come to him and to his descendants after him, and he has been recorded on the heavenly tablets as a friend and a righteous man.",
        "30:21": "All this account I have written for thee, and have commanded thee to say to the children of Israel, that they should not commit sin nor transgress the ordinances nor break the covenant which has been ordained for them, (but) that they should fulfil it and be recorded as friends.",
        "30:22": "But if they transgress and work uncleanness in every way, they will be recorded on the heavenly tablets as adversaries, and they will be destroyed out of the book of life, and they will be recorded in the book of those who will be destroyed and with those who will be rooted out of the earth.",
        "30:23": "And on the day when the sons of Jacob slew Shechem a writing was recorded in their favour in heaven that they had executed righteousness and uprightness and vengeance on the sinners, and it was written for a blessing.",
        "30:24": "And they brought Dinah, their sister, out of the house of Shechem, and they took captive everything that was in Shechem, their sheep and their oxen and their asses, and all their wealth, and all their flocks, and brought them all to Jacob their father.",
        "30:25": "And he reproached them because they had put the city to the sword for he feared those who dwelt in the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites.",
        "30:26": "And the dread of the Lord was upon all the cities which are around about Shechem, and they did not rise to pursue after the sons of Jacob; for terror had fallen upon them.",
        "31:1": "And on the new moon of the month Jacob spake to all the people of his house. saying: 'Purify yourselves and change your garments, and let us arise and go up to Bethel, where I vowed a vow to Him on the day when I fled from the face of Esau my brother, because he has been with me and brought me into this land in peace, and put ye away the strange gods that arc among you.'",
        "31:2": "And they gave up the strange gods and that which was in their ears and which was on their necks and the idols which Rachel stole from Laban her father she gave wholly to Jacob. And he burnt and brake them to pieces and destroyed them, and hid them under an oak which is in the land of Shechem.",
        "31:3": "And he went up on the new moon of the seventh month to Bethel. And he built an altar at the place where he had slept, and he set up a pillar there, and he sent word to his father Isaac to come to him to his sacrifice, and to his mother Rebecca.",
        "31:4": "And Isaac said: 'Let my son Jacob come, and let me see him before I die.'",
        "31:5": "And Jacob went to his father Isaac and to his mother Rebecca, to the house of his father Abraham, and he took two of his sons with him, Levi and Judah, and he came to his father Isaac and to his mother Rebecca.",
        "31:6": "And Rebecca came forth from the tower to the front of it to kiss Jacob and embrace him; for her spirit had revived when she heard: 'Behold Jacob thy son has come'; and she kissed him.",
        "31:7": "And she saw his two sons, and she recognised them, and said unto him: 'Are these thy sons, my son?' and she embraced them and kissed them, and blessed them, saying: 'In you shall the seed of Abraham become illustrious, and ye shall prove a blessing on the earth.'",
        "31:8": "And Jacob went in to Isaac his father, to the chamber where he lay, and his two sons were with him, and he took the hand of his father, and stooping down he kissed him, and Isaac clung to the neck of Jacob his son, and wept upon his neck.",
        "31:9": "And the darkness left the eyes of Isaac, and he saw the two sons of Jacob, Levi, and Judah, and he said: 'Are these thy sons, my son? for they are like thee.'",
        "31:10": "And he said unto him that they were truly his sons: 'And thou hast truly seen that they are truly my sons'.",
        "31:11": "And they came near to him, and he turned and kissed them and embraced them both together.",
        "31:12": "And the spirit of prophecy came down into his mouth, and he took Levi by his right hand and Judah by his left.",
        "31:13": "And he turned to Levi first, and began to bless him first, and said unto him: 'May the God of all, the very Lord of all the ages, bless thee and thy children throughout all the ages.",
        "31:14": "And may the Lord give to thee and to thy seed greatness and great glory, and cause thee and thy seed, from among all flesh, to approach Him to serve in His sanctuary as the angels of the presence and as the holy ones. (Even) as they, shall the seed of thy sons be for glory and greatness and holiness, and may He make them great unto all the ages.",
        "31:15": "And they shall be judges and princes, and chiefs of all the seed of the sons of Jacob; They shall speak the word of the Lord in righteousness, And they shall judge all His judgments in righteousness. And they shall declare My ways to Jacob And My paths to Israel. The blessing of the Lord shall be given in their mouths To bless all the seed of the beloved.",
        "31:16": "Thy mother has called thy name Levi, And justly has she called thy name; Thou shalt be joined to the Lord And be the companion of all the sons of Jacob; Let His table be thine, And do thou and thy sons eat thereof; And may thy table be full unto all generations, And thy food fail not unto all the ages.",
        "31:17": "And let all who hate thee fall down before thee, And let all thy adversaries be rooted out and perish; And blessed be he that blesses thee, And cursed be every nation that curses thee.'",
        "31:18": "And to Judah he said: 'May the Lord give thee strength and power to tread down all that hate thee; A prince shalt thou be, thou and one of thy sons, over the sons of Jacob; May thy name and the name of thy sons go forth and traverse every land and region. Then shall the Gentiles fear before thy face, And all the nations shall quake [And all the peoples shall quake].",
        "31:19": "In thee shall be the help of Jacob, And in thee be found the salvation of Israel.",
        "31:20": "And when thou sittest on the throne of honour of thy righteousness There shall be great peace for all the seed of the sons of the beloved; Blessed be he that blesseth thee, And all that hate thee and afflict thee and curse thee Shall be rooted out and destroyed from the earth and be accursed.'",
        "31:21": "And turning he kissed him again and embraced him, and rejoiced greatly; for he had seen the sons of Jacob his son in very truth.",
        "31:22": "And he went forth from between his feet and fell down and bowed down to him, and he blessed them and rested there with Isaac his father that night, and they eat and drank with joy.",
        "31:23": "And he made the two sons of Jacob sleep, the one on his right hand and the other on his left, and it was counted to him for righteousness.",
        "31:24": "And Jacob told his father everything during the night, how the Lord had shown him great mercy, and how he had prospered (him in) all his ways, and protected him from all evil.",
        "31:25": "And Isaac blessed the God of his father Abraham, who had not withdrawn his mercy and his righteousness from the sons of his servant Isaac.",
        "31:26": "And in the morning Jacob told his father Isaac the vow which he had vowed to the Lord, and the vision which he had seen, and that he had built an altar, and that everything was ready for the sacrifice to be made before the Lord as he had vowed, and that he had come to set him on an ass.",
        "31:27": "And Isaac said unto Jacob his son: 'I am not able to go with thee; for I am old and not able to bear the way: go, my son, in peace; for I am one hundred and sixty-five years this day; I am no longer able to journey; set thy mother (on an ass) and let her go with thee.",
        "31:28": "And I know, my son, that thou hast come on my account, and may this day be blessed on which thou hast seen me alive, and I also have seen thee, my son.",
        "31:29": "Mayest thou prosper and fulfil the vow which thou hast vowed; and put not off thy vow; for thou shalt be called to account as touching the vow; now therefore make haste to perform it, and may He be pleased who has made all things, to whom thou hast vowed the vow.'",
        "31:30": "And he said to Rebecca: 'Go with Jacob thy son'; and Rebecca went with Jacob her son, and Deborah with her, and they came to Bethel.",
        "31:31": "And Jacob remembered the prayer with which his father had blessed him and his two sons, Levi and Judah, and he rejoiced and blessed the God of his fathers, Abraham and Isaac.",
        "31:32": "And he said: 'Now I know that I have an eternal hope, and my sons also, before the God of all'; and thus is it ordained concerning the two; and they record it as an eternal testimony unto them on the heavenly tablets how Isaac blessed them.",
        "32:1": "And he abode that night at Bethel, and Levi dreamed that they had ordained and made him the priest of the Most High God, him and his sons for ever; and he awoke from his sleep and blessed the Lord.",
        "32:2": "And Jacob rose early in the morning, on the fourteenth of this month, and he gave a tithe of all that came with him, both of men and cattle, both of gold and every vessel and garment, yea, he gave tithes of all.",
        "32:3": "And in those days Rachel became pregnant with her son Benjamin. And Jacob counted his sons from him upwards and Levi fell to the portion of the Lord, and his father clothed him in the garments of the priesthood and filled his hands.",

        "32:5": "This was his offering, in consequence of the vow which he had vowed that he would give a tenth, with their fruit-offerings and their drink- offerings.",
        "32:6": "And when the fire had consumed it, he burnt incense on the fire over the fire, and for a thank-offering two oxen and four rams and four sheep, four he-goats, and two sheep of a year old, and two kids of the goats; and thus he did daily for seven days.",
        "32:7": "And he and all his sons and his men were eating (this) with joy there during seven days and blessing and thanking the Lord, who had delivered him out of all his tribulation and had given him his vow.",
        "32:8": "And he tithed all the clean animals, and made a burnt sacrifice, but the unclean animals he gave (not) to Levi his son, and he gave him all the souls of the men.",
        "32:9": "And Levi discharged the priestly office at Bethel before Jacob his father in preference to his ten brothers, and he was a priest there, and Jacob gave his vow: thus he tithed again the tithe to the Lord and sanctified it, and it became holy unto Him.",
        "32:10": "And for this reason it is ordained on the heavenly tablets as a law for the tithing again the tithe to eat before the Lord from year to year, in the place where it is chosen that His name should dwell, and to this law there is no limit of days for ever.",
        "32:11": "This ordinance is written that it may be fulfilled from year to year in eating the second tithe before the Lord in the place where it has been chosen, and nothing shall remain over from it from this year to the year following.",
        "32:12": "For in its year shall the seed be eaten till the days of the gathering of the seed of the year, and the wine till the days of the wine, and the oil till the days of its season.",
        "32:13": "And all that is left thereof and becomes old, let it be regarded as polluted: let it be burnt with fire, for it is unclean.",
        "32:14": "And thus let them eat it together in the sanctuary, and let them not suffer it to become old.",
        "32:15": "And all the tithes of the oxen and sheep shall be holy unto the Lord, and shall belong to his priests, which they will eat before Him from year to year; for thus is it ordained and engraven regarding the tithe on the heavenly tablets.",
        "32:16": "And on the following night, on the twenty-second day of this month, Jacob resolved to build that place, and to surround the court with a wall, and to sanctify it and make it holy for ever, for himself and his children after him.",
        "32:17": "And the Lord appeared to him by night and blessed him and said unto him: 'Thy name shall not be called Jacob, but Israel shall they name thy name.'",
        "32:18": "And He said unto him again: 'I am the Lord who created the heaven and the earth, and I will increase thee and multiply thee exceedingly, and kings shall come forth from thee, and they shall judge everywhere wherever the foot of the sons of men has trodden.",
        "32:19": "And I will give to thy seed all the earth which is under heaven, and they shall judge all the nations according to their desires, and after that they shall get possession of the whole earth and inherit it for ever.'",
        "32:20": "And He finished speaking with him, and He went up from him. and Jacob looked till He had ascended into heaven.",
        "32:21": "And he saw in a vision of the night, and behold an angel descended from heaven with seven tablets in his hands, and he gave them to Jacob, and he read them and knew all that was written therein which would befall him and his sons throughout all the ages.",
        "32:22": "And he showed him all that was written on the tablets, and said unto him: 'Do not build this place, and do not make it an eternal sanctuary, and do not dwell here; for this is not the place. Go to the house of Abraham thy father and dwell with Isaac thy father until the day of the death of thy father.",
        "32:23": "For in Egypt thou shalt die in peace, and in this land thou shalt be buried with honour in the sepulchre of thy fathers, with Abraham and Isaac.",

        "32:25": "And Jacob said: 'Lord, how can I remember all that I have read and seen? 'And he said unto him: 'I will bring all things to thy remembrance.'",
        "32:26": "And he went up from him, and he awoke from his sleep, and he remembered everything which he had read and seen, and he wrote down all the words which he had read and seen.",
        "32:27": "And he celebrated there yet another day, and he sacrificed thereon according to all that he sacrificed on the former days, and called its name 'Addition,' for this day was added and the former days he called 'The Feast '.",
        "32:28": "And thus it was manifested that it should be, and it is written on the heavenly tablets: wherefore it was revealed to him that he should celebrate it, and add it to the seven days of the feast.",
        "32:29": "And its name was called 'Addition,' because that it was recorded amongst the days of the feast days, according to the number of the days of the year.",
        "32:30": "And in the night, on the twenty-third of this month, Deborah Rebecca's nurse died, and they buried her beneath the city under the oak of the river, and he called the name of this place, 'The river of Deborah,' and the oak, 'The oak of the mourning of Deborah.'",
        "32:31": "And Rebecca went and returned to her house to his father Isaac, and Jacob sent by her hand rams and sheep and he-goats that she should prepare a meal for his father such as he desired.",
        "32:32": "And he went after his mother till he came to the land of Kabratan, and he dwelt there.",
        "32:33": "And Rachel bare a son in the night, and called his name 'Son of my sorrow '; for she suffered in giving him birth: but his father called his name Benjamin, on the eleventh of the eighth month in the first of the sixth week of this jubilee. [2143 A.M.]",
        "32:34": "And Rachel died there and she was buried in the land of Ephrath, the same is Bethlehem, and Jacob built a pillar on the grave of Rachel, on the road above her grave.",
        "33:1": "And Jacob went and dwelt to the south of Magdaladra'ef. And he went to his father Isaac, he and Leah his wife, on the new moon of the tenth month.",
        "33:2": "And Reuben saw Bilhah, Rachel's maid, the concubine of his father, bathing in water in a secret place, and he loved her.",
        "33:3": "And he hid himself at night, and he entered the house of Bilhah [at night], and he found her sleeping alone on a bed in her house.",
        "33:4": "And he lay with her, and she awoke and saw, and behold Reuben was lying with her in the bed, and she uncovered the border of her covering and seized him, and cried out, and discovered that it was Reuben.",
        "33:5": "And she was ashamed because of him, and released her hand from him, and he fled.",
        "33:6": "And she lamented because of this thing exceedingly, and did not tell it to any one.",
        "33:7": "And when Jacob returned and sought her, she said unto him: 'I am not clean for thee, for I have been defiled as regards thee; for Reuben has defiled me, and has lain with me in the night, and I was asleep, and did not discover until he uncovered my skirt and slept with me.'",
        "33:8": "And Jacob was exceedingly wroth with Reuben because he had lain with Bilhah, because he had uncovered his father's skirt.",
        "33:9": "And Jacob did not approach her again because Reuben had defiled her. And as for any man who uncovers his father's skirt his deed is wicked exceedingly, for he is abominable before the Lord.",
        "33:10": "For this reason it is written and ordained on the heavenly tablets that a man should not lie with his father's wife, and should not uncover his father's skirt, for this is unclean: they shall surely die together, the man who lies with his father's wife and the woman also, for they have wrought uncleanness on the earth.",
        "33:11": "And there shall be nothing unclean before our God in the nation which He has chosen for Himself as a possession.",
        "33:12": "And again, it is written a second time: 'Cursed be he who lieth with the wife of his father, for he hath uncovered his father's shame'; and all the holy ones of the Lord said 'So be it; so be it.'",
        "33:13": "And do thou, Moses, command the children of Israel that they observe this word; for it (entails) a punishment of death; and it is unclean, and there is no atonement for ever to atone for the man who has committed this, but he is to be put to death and slain, and stoned with stones, and rooted out from the midst of the people of our God.",
        "33:14": "For to no man who does so in Israel is it permitted to remain alive a single day on the earth, for he is abominable and unclean.",
        "33:15": "And let them not say: to Reuben was granted life and forgiveness after he had lain with his father's concubine, and to her also though she had a husband, and her husband Jacob, his father, was still alive.",
        "33:16": "For until that time there had not been revealed the ordinance and judgment and law in its completeness for all, but in thy days (it has been revealed) as a law of seasons and of days, and an everlasting law for the everlasting generations.",
        "33:17": "And for this law there is no consummation of days, and no atonement for it, but they must both be rooted out in the midst of the nation: on the day whereon they committed it they shall slay them.",
        "33:18": "And do thou, Moses, write (it) down for Israel that they may observe it, and do according to these words, and not commit a sin unto death; for the Lord our God is judge, who respects not persons and accepts not gifts.",
        "33:19": "And tell them these words of the covenant, that they may hear and observe, and be on their guard with respect to them, and not be destroyed and rooted out of the land; for an uncleanness, and an abomination, and a contamination, and a pollution are all they who commit it on the earth before our God.",
        "33:20": "And there is no greater sin than the fornication which they commit on earth; for Israel is a holy nation unto the Lord its God, and a nation of inheritance, and a priestly and royal nation and for (His own) possession; and there shall no such uncleanness appear in the midst of the holy nation.",
        "33:21": "And in the third year of this sixth week [2145 A.M.] Jacob and all his sons went and dwelt in the house of Abraham, near Isaac his father and Rebecca his mother.",

        "33:23": "And they came and bowed themselves to Isaac and Rebecca, and when they saw them they blessed Jacob and all his sons, and Isaac rejoiced exceedingly, for he saw the sons of Jacob, his younger son and he blessed them.",
        "34:1": "And in the sixth year of this week of this forty-fourth jubilee [2148 A.M.] Jacob sent his sons to pasture their sheep, and his servants with them to the pastures of Shechem.",
        "34:2": "And the seven kings of the Amorites assembled themselves together against them, to slay them, hiding themselves under the trees, and to take their cattle as a prey.",
        "34:3": "And Jacob and Levi and Judah and Joseph were in the house with Isaac their father; for his spirit was sorrowful, and they could not leave him: and Benjamin was the youngest, and for this reason remained with his father.",
        "34:4": "And there came the king[s] of Taphu and the king[s] of 'Aresa, and the king[s] of Seragan, and the king[s] of Selo, and the king[s] of Ga'as, and the king of Bethoron, and the king of Ma'anisakir, and all those who dwell in these mountains (and) who dwell in the woods in the land of Canaan.",
        "34:5": "And they announced this to Jacob saying: 'Behold, the kings of the Amorites have surrounded thy sons, and plundered their herds.'",
        "34:6": "And he arose from his house, he and his three sons and all the servants of his father, and his own servants, and he went against them with six thousand men, who carried swords.",
        "34:7": "And he slew them in the pastures of Shechem, and pursued those who fled, and he slew them with the edge of the sword, and he slew 'Aresa and Taphu and Saregan and Selo and 'Amani- sakir and Ga[ga]'as, and he recovered his herds.",
        "34:8": "And he prevailed over them, and imposed tribute on them that they should pay him tribute, five fruit products of their land, and he built Robel and Tamnatares.",
        "34:9": "And he returned in peace, and made peace with them, and they became his servants, until the day that he and his sons went down into Egypt.",
        "34:10": "And in the seventh year of this week [2149 A.M.] he sent Joseph to learn about the welfare of his brothers from his house to the land of Shechem, and he found them in the land of Dothan.",
        "34:11": "And they dealt treacherously with him, and formed a plot against him to slay him, but changing their minds, they sold him to Ishmaelite merchants, and they brought him down into Egypt, and they sold him to Potiphar, the eunuch of Pharaoh, the chief of the cooks, priest of the city of 'Elew.",
        "34:12": "And the sons of Jacob slaughtered a kid, and dipped the coat of Joseph in the blood, and sent (it) to Jacob their father on the tenth of the seventh month.",
        "34:13": "And he mourned all that night, for they had brought it to him in the evening, and he became feverish with mourning for his death, and he said: 'An evil beast hath devoured Joseph'; and all the members of his house [mourned with him that day, and they] were grieving and mourning with him all that day.",
        "34:14": "And his sons and his daughter rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted for his son.",
        "34:15": "And on that day Bilhah heard that Joseph had perished, and she died mourning him, and she was living in Qafratef, and Dinah also, his daughter, died after Joseph had perished.",
        "34:16": "And there came these three mournings upon Israel in one month. And they buried Bilhah over against the tomb of Rachel, and Dinah also. his daughter, they buried there.",
        "34:17": "And he mourned for Joseph one year, and did not cease, for he said 'Let me go down to the grave mourning for my son'.",
        "34:18": "For this reason it is ordained for the children of Israel that they should afflict themselves on the tenth of the seventh month -on the day that the news which made him weep for Joseph came to Jacob his father- that they should make atonement for themselves thereon with a young goat on the tenth of the seventh month, once a year, for their sins; for they had grieved the affection of their father regarding Joseph his son.",
        "34:19": "And this day has been ordained that they should grieve thereon for their sins, and for all their transgressions and for all their errors, so that they might cleanse themselves on that day once a year.",
        "34:20": "And after Joseph perished, the sons of Jacob took unto themselves wives. The name of Reuben's wife is 'Ada; and the name of Simeon's wife is 'Adlba'a, a Canaanite; and the name of Levi's wife is Melka, of the daughters of Aram, of the seed of the sons of Terah; and the name of Judah's wife, Betasu'el, a Canaanite; and the name of Issachar's wife, Hezaqa: and the name of Zabulon's wife, Ni'iman; and the name of Dan's wife, 'Egla; and the name of Naphtali's wife, Rasu'u, of Mesopotamia; and the name of Gad's wife, Maka; and the name of Asher's wife, 'Ijona; and the name of Joseph's wife, Asenath, the Egyptian; and the name of Benjamin's wife, 'Ijasaka.",

        "35:2": "And Jacob said: 'I will do everything as thou hast commanded me; for this thing will be honour and greatness to me, and righteousness before the Lord, that I should honour them.",
        "35:3": "And thou too, mother, knowest from the time I was born until this day, all my deeds and all that is in my heart, that I always think good concerning all.",
        "35:4": "And how should I not do this thing which thou hast commanded me, that I should honour my father and my brother!",
        "35:5": "Tell me, mother, what perversity hast thou seen in me and I shall turn away from it, and mercy will be upon me.'",
        "35:6": "And she said unto him: 'My son, I have not seen in thee all my days any perverse but (only) upright deeds. And yet I will tell thee the truth, my son: I shall die this year, and I shall not survive this year in my life; for I have seen in a dream the day of my death, that I should not live beyond a hundred and fifty-five years: and behold I have completed all the days of my life which I am to live.'",
        "35:7": "And Jacob laughed at the words of his mother. because his mother had said unto him that she should die; and she was sitting opposite to him in possession of her strength, and she was not infirm in her strength; for she went in and out and saw, and her teeth were strong, and no ailment had touched her all the days of her life.",
        "35:8": "And Jacob said unto her: 'Blessed am I, mother, if my days approach the days of thy life, and my strength remain with me thus as thy strength: and thou wilt not die, for thou art jesting idly with me regarding thy death.'",
        "35:9": "And she went in to Isaac and said unto him: 'One petition I make unto thee: make Esau swear that he will not injure Jacob, nor pursue him with enmity; for thou knowest Esau's thoughts that they are perverse from his youth, and there is no goodness in him; for he desires after thy death to kill him.",
        "35:10": "And thou knowest all that he has done since the day Jacob his brother went to Haran until this day: how he has forsaken us with his whole heart, and has done evil to us; thy flocks he has taken to himself, and carried off all thy possessions from before thy face.",
        "35:11": "And when we implored and besought him for what was our own, he did as a man who was taking pity on us.",
        "35:12": "And he is bitter against thee because thou didst bless Jacob thy perfect and upright son; for there is no evil but only goodness in him, and since he came from Haran unto this day he has not robbed us of aught, for he brings us everything in its season always, and rejoices with all his heart when we take at his hands and he blesses us, and has not parted from us since he came from Haran until this day, and he remains with us continually at home honouring us.'",
        "35:13": "And Isaac said unto her: 'I, too, know and see the deeds of Jacob who is with us, how that with all his heart he honours us; but I loved Esau formerly more than Jacob, because he was the firstborn; but now I love Jacob more than Esau, for he has done manifold evil deeds, and there is no righteousness in him, for all his ways are unrighteousness and violence, [and there is no righteousness around him.]",
        "35:14": "And now my heart is troubled because of all his deeds, and neither he nor his seed is to be saved, for they are those who will be destroyed from the earth and who will be rooted out from under heaven, for he has forsaken the God of Abraham and gone after his wives and after their uncleanness and after their error, he and his children.",
        "35:15": "And thou dost bid me make him swear that he will not slay Jacob his brother; even if he swear he will not abide by his oath, and he will not do good but evil only.",
        "35:16": "But if he desires to slay Jacob, his brother, into Jacob's hands will he be given, and he will not escape from his hands, [for he will descend into his hands.]",
        "35:17": "And fear thou not on account of Jacob; for the guardian of Jacob is great and powerful and honoured, and praised more than the guardian of Esau.'",
        "35:18": "And Rebecca sent and called Esau and he came to her, and she said unto him: 'I have a petition, my son, to make unto thee, and do thou promise to do it, my son.'",
        "35:19": "And he said: 'I will do everything that thou sayest unto me, and I will not refuse thy petition.'",
        "35:20": "And she said unto him: 'I ask you that the day I die, thou wilt take me in and bury me near Sarah, thy father's mother, and that thou and Jacob will love each other and that neither will desire evil against the other, but mutual love only, and (so) ye will prosper, my sons, and be honoured in the midst of the land, and no enemy will rejoice over you, and ye will be a blessing and a mercy in the eyes of all those that love you.'",
        "35:21": "And he said: 'I will do all that thou hast told me, and I shall bury thee on the day thou diest near Sarah, my father's mother, as thou hast desired that her bones may be near thy bones.",
        "35:22": "And Jacob, my brother, also, I shall love above all flesh; for I have not a brother in all the earth but him only: and this is no great merit for me if I love him; for he is my brother, and we were sown together in thy body, and together came we forth from thy womb, and if I do not love my brother, whom shall I love?",
        "35:23": "And I, myself, beg thee to exhort Jacob concerning me and concerning my sons, for I know that he will assuredly be king over me and my sons, for on the day my father blessed him he made him the higher and me the lower.",
        "35:24": "And I swear unto thee that I shall love him, and not desire evil against him all the days of my life but good only.'",
        "35:25": "And he sware unto her regarding all this matter. And she called Jacob before the eyes of Esau, and gave him commandment according to the words which she had spoken to Esau.",
        "35:26": "And he said: 'I shall do thy pleasure; believe me that no evil will proceed from me or from my sons against Esau, and I shall be first in naught save in love only.'",
        "35:27": "And they eat and drank, she and her sons that night, and she died, three jubilees and one week and one year old, on that night, and her two sons, Esau and Jacob, buried her in the double cave near Sarah, their father's mother.",
        "36:1": "And in the sixth year of this week [2162 A.M.] Isaac called his two sons Esau and Jacob, and they came to him, and he said unto them: 'My sons, I am going the way of my fathers, to the eternal house where my fathers are.",
        "36:2": "Wherefore bury me near Abraham my father, in the double cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite, where Abraham purchased a sepulchre to bury in; in the sepulchre which I digged for myself, there bury me.",
        "36:3": "And this I command you, my sons, that ye practise righteousness and uprightness on the earth, so that the Lord may bring upon you all that the Lord said that he would do to Abraham and to his seed.",
        "36:4": "And love one another, my sons, your brothers as a man who loves his own soul, and let each seek in what he may benefit his brother, and act together on the earth; and let them love each other as their own souls.",
        "36:5": "And concerning the question of idols, I command and admonish you to reject them and hate them, and love them not, for they are full of deception for those that worship them and for those that bow down to them.",

        "49:2": "For on this night -the beginning of the festival and the beginning of the joy- ye were eating the passover in Egypt, when all the powers of Mastêmâ had been let loose to slay all the first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh to the first-born of the captive maid-servant in the mill, and to the cattle.",
        "49:3": "And this is the sign which the Lord gave them: Into every house on the lintels of which they saw the blood of a lamb of the first year, into (that) house they should not enter to slay, but should pass by (it), that all those should be saved that were in the house because the sign of the blood was on its lintels.",

        "49:10": "Let the children of Israel come and observe the passover on the day of its fixed time, on the fourteenth day of the first month, between the evenings, from the third part of the day to the third part of the night, for two portions of the day are given to the light, and a third part to the evening.",
        "49:11": "This is that which the Lord commanded thee that thou shouldst observe it between the evenings.",
        "49:12": "And it is not permissible to slay it during any period of the light, but during the period bordering on the evening, and let them eat it at the time of the evening, until the third part of the night, and whatever is left over of all its flesh from the third part of the night and onwards, let them burn it with fire.",

        "49:14": "For this reason the Lord commanded the children of Israel to observe the passover on the day of its fixed time, and they shall not break a bone thereof; for it is a festival day, and a day commanded, and there may be no passing over from day to day, and month to month, but on the day of its festival let it be observed.",
        "49:15": "And do thou command the children of Israel to observe the passover throughout their days, every year, once a year on the day of its fixed time, and it shall come for a memorial well pleasing before the Lord, and no plague shall come upon them to slay or to smite in that year in which they celebrate the passover in its season in every respect according to His command.",
        "49:16": "And they shall not eat it outside the sanctuary of the Lord, but before the sanctuary of the Lord, and all the people of the congregation of Israel shall celebrate it in its appointed season.",
        "49:17": "And every man who has come upon its day shall eat it in the sanctuary of your God before the Lord from twenty years old and upward; for thus is it written and ordained that they should eat it in the sanctuary of the Lord.",
        "49:18": "And when the children of Israel come into the land which they are to possess, into the land of Canaan, and set up the tabernacle of the Lord in the midst of the land in one of their tribes until the sanctuary of the Lord has been built in the land, let them come and celebrate the passover in the midst of the tabernacle of the Lord, and let them slay it before the Lord from year to year.",
        "49:19": "And in the days when the house has been built in the name of the Lord in the land of their inheritance, they shall go there and slay the passover in the evening, at sunset, at the third part of the day.",
        "49:20": "And they shall offer its blood on the threshold of the altar, and shall place its fat on the fire which is upon the altar, and they shall eat its flesh roasted with fire in the court of the house which has been sanctified in the name of the Lord.",
        "49:21": "And they may not celebrate the passover in their cities, nor in any place save before the tabernacle of the Lord, or before His house where His name hath dwelt; and they shall not go astray from the Lord.",
        "49:22": "And do thou, Moses, command the children of Israel to observe the ordinances of the passover, as it was commanded unto thee; declare thou unto them every year and the day of its days, and the festival of unleavened bread, that they should eat unleavened bread seven days, (and) that they should observe its festival, and that they bring an oblation every day during those seven days of joy before the Lord on the altar of your God.",
        "49:23": "For ye celebrated this festival with haste when ye went forth from Egypt till ye entered into the wilderness of Shur; for on the shore of the sea ye completed it.",
        "50:1": "And after this law I made known to thee the days of the Sabbaths in the desert of Sin[ai], which is between Elim and Sinai.",
        "50:2": "And I told thee of the Sabbaths of the land on Mount Sinai, and I told thee of the jubilee years in the sabbaths of years: but the year thereof have I not told thee till ye enter the land which ye are to possess.",
        "50:3": "And the land also shall keep its sabbaths while they dwell upon it, and they shall know the jubilee year.",
        "50:4": "Wherefore I have ordained for thee the year-weeks and the years and the jubilees: there are forty-nine jubilees from the days of Adam until this day, [2410 A.M.] and one week and two years: and there are yet forty years to come (lit. 'distant') for learning the [2450 A.M.] commandments of the Lord, until they pass over into the land of Canaan, crossing the Jordan to the west.",
        "50:5": "And the jubilees shall pass by, until Israel is cleansed from all guilt of fornication, and uncleanness, and pollution, and sin, and error, and dwells with confidence in all the land, and there shall be no more a Satan or any evil one, and the land shall be clean from that time for evermore.",
        "50:6": "And behold the commandment regarding the Sabbaths -I have written (them) down for thee- and all the judgments of its laws.",
        "50:7": "Six days shalt thou labour, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it ye shall do no manner of work, ye and your sons, and your men- servants and your maid-servants, and all your cattle and the sojourner also who is with you.",
        "50:8": "And the man that does any work on it shall die: whoever desecrates that day, whoever lies with (his) wife, or whoever says he will do something on it, that he will set out on a journey thereon in regard to any buying or selling: and whoever draws water thereon which he had not prepared for himself on the sixth day, and whoever takes up any burden to carry it out of his tent or out of his house shall die.",
        "50:9": "Ye shall do no work whatever on the Sabbath day save what ye have prepared for yourselves on the sixth day, so as to eat, and drink, and rest, and keep Sabbath from all work on that day, and to bless the Lord your God, who has given you a day of festival and a holy day: and a day of the holy kingdom for all Israel is this day among their days for ever.",
        "50:10": "For great is the honour which the Lord has given to Israel that they should eat and drink and be satisfied on this festival day, and rest thereon from all labour which belongs to the labour of the children of men save burning frankincense and bringing oblations and sacrifices before the Lord for days and for Sabbaths.",
        "50:11": "This work alone shall be done on the Sabbath-days in the sanctuary of the Lord your God; that they may atone for Israel with sacrifice continually from day to day for a memorial well-pleasing before the Lord, and that He may receive them always from day to day according as thou hast been commanded.",
        "50:12": "And every man who does any work thereon, or goes a journey, or tills (his) farm, whether in his house or any other place, and whoever lights a fire, or rides on any beast, or travels by ship on the sea, and whoever strikes or kills anything, or slaughters a beast or a bird, or whoever catches an animal or a bird or a fish, or whoever fasts or makes war on the Sabbaths:",
        "50:13": "The man who does any of these things on the Sabbath shall die, so that the children of Israel shall observe the Sabbaths according to the commandments regarding the Sabbaths of the land, as it is written in the tablets, which He gave into my hands that I should write out for thee the laws of the seasons, and the seasons according to the division of their days. Herewith is completed the account of the division of the days."

        "3:24": "O ye men, is not wine the strongest, that enforceth to do thus? And when he had so spoken, he held his peace.",
        "4:1": "Then the second, that had spoken of the strength of the king, began to say,",
        "4:2": "O ye men, do not men excel in strength that bear rule over sea and land and all things in them?",
        "4:3": "But yet the king is more mighty: for he is lord of all these things, and hath dominion over them; and whatsoever he commandeth them they do.",

        "4:11": "And these keep watch round about him, neither may any one depart, and do his own business, neither disobey they him in any thing.",
        "4:12": "O ye men, how should not the king be mightiest, when in such sort he is obeyed? And he held his tongue.",
        "4:13": "Then the third, who had spoken of women, and of the truth, (this was Zorobabel) began to speak.",
        "4:14": "O ye men, it is not the great king, nor the multitude of men, neither is it wine, that excelleth; who is it then that ruleth them, or hath the lordship over them? are they not women?",

        "4:20": "A man leaveth his own father that brought him up, and his own country, and cleaveth unto his wife.",
        "4:21": "He sticketh not to spend his life with his wife. and remembereth neither father, nor mother, nor country.",
        "4:22": "By this also ye must know that women have dominion over you: do ye not labour and toil, and give and bring all to the woman?",
        "4:23": "Yea, a man taketh his sword, and goeth his way to rob and to steal, to sail upon the sea and upon rivers;",
        "4:24": "And looketh upon a lion, and goeth in the darkness; and when he hath stolen, spoiled, and robbed, he bringeth it to his love.",
        "4:25": "Wherefore a man loveth his wife better than father or mother.",
        "4:26": "Yea, many there be that have run out of their wits for women, and become servants for their sakes.",
        "4:27": "Many also have perished, have erred, and sinned, for women.",
        "4:28": "And now do ye not believe me? is not the king great in his power? do not all regions fear to touch him?",
        "4:29": "Yet did I see him and Apame the king’s concubine, the daughter of the admirable Bartacus, sitting at the right hand of the king,",
        "4:30": "And taking the crown from the king’s head, and setting it upon her own head; she also struck the king with her left hand.",
        "4:31": "And yet for all this the king gaped and gazed upon her with open mouth: if she laughed upon him, he laughed also: but if she took any displeasure at him, the king was fain to flatter, that she might be reconciled to him again.",
        "4:32": "O ye men, how can it be but women should be strong, seeing they do thus?",
        "4:33": "Then the king and the princes looked one upon another: so he began to speak of the truth.",
        "4:34": "O ye men, are not women strong? great is the earth, high is the heaven, swift is the sun in his course, for he compasseth the heavens round about, and fetcheth his course again to his own place in one day.",
        "4:35": "Is he not great that maketh these things? therefore great is the truth, and stronger than all things.",
        "4:36": "All the earth crieth upon the truth, and the heaven blesseth it: all works shake and tremble at it, and with it is no unrighteous thing.",
        "4:37": "Wine is wicked, the king is wicked, women are wicked, all the children of men are wicked, and such are all their wicked works; and there is no truth in them; in their unrighteousness also they shall perish.",
        "4:38": "As for the truth, it endureth, and is alwaYs strong; it liveth and conquereth for evermore.",
        "4:39": "With her there is no accepting of persons or rewards; but she doeth the things that are just, and refraineth from all unjust and wicked things; and all men do well like of her works.",
        "4:40": "Neither in her judgment is any unrighteousness; and she is the strength, kingdom, power, and majesty, of all ages. Blessed be the God of truth.",
        "4:41": "And with that he held his peace. And all the people then shouted, and said, Great is Truth, and mighty above all things.",
        "4:42": "Then said the king unto him, Ask what thou wilt more than is appointed in the writing, and we will give it thee, because thou art found wisest; and thou shalt sit next me, and shalt be called my cousin.",
        "4:43": "Then said he unto the king, Remember thy vow, which thou hast vowed to build Jerusalem, in the day when thou camest to thy kingdom,",
        "4:44": "And to send away all the vessels that were taken away out of Jerusalem, which Cyrus set apart, when he vowed to destroy Babylon, and to send them again thither.",
        "4:45": "Thou also hast vowed to build up the temple, which the Edomites burned when Judea was made desolate by the Chaldees.",
        "4:46": "And now, O lord the king, this is that which I require, and which I desire of thee, and this is the princely liberality proceeding from thyself: I desire therefore that thou make good the vow, the performance whereof with thine own mouth thou hast vowed to the King of heaven.",
        "4:47": "Then Darius the king stood up, and kissed him, and wrote letters for him unto all the treasurers and lieutenants and captains and governors, that they should safely convey on their way both him, and all those that go up with him to build Jerusalem.",

        "4:50": "And that all the country which they hold should be free without tribute; and that the Edomites should give over the villages of the Jews which then they held:",
        "4:51": "Yea, that there should be yearly given twenty talents to the building of the temple, until the time that it were built;",
        "4:52": "And other ten talents yearly, to maintain the burnt offerings upon the altar every day, as they had a commandment to offer seventeen:",

        "8:53": "And again we besought our Lord as touching these things, and found him favourable unto us.",
        "8:54": "Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Esebrias, and Assanias, and ten men of their brethren with them:",
        "8:55": "And I weighed them the gold, and the silver, and the holy vessels of the house of our Lord, which the king, and his council, and the princes, and all Israel, had given.",
        "8:56": "And when I had weighed it, I delivered unto them six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels of an hundred talents, and an hundred talents of gold,",
        "8:57": "And twenty golden vessels, and twelve vessels of brass, even of fine brass, glittering like gold.",

        "8:69": "The nation of Israel, the princes, the priests and Levites, have not put away from them the strange people of the land, nor the pollutions of the Gentiles to wit, of the Canaanites, Hittites, Pheresites, Jebusites, and the Moabites, Egyptians, and Edomites.",
        "8:70": "For both they and their sons have married with their daughters, and the holy seed is mixed with the strange people of the land; and from the beginning of this matter the rulers and the great men have been partakers of this iniquity.",
        "8:71": "And as soon as I had heard these things, I rent my clothes, and the holy garment, and pulled off the hair from off my head and beard, and sat me down sad and very heavy.",
        "8:72": "So all they that were then moved at the word of the Lord God of Israel assembled unto me, whilst I mourned for the iniquity: but I sat still full of heaviness until the evening sacrifice.",
        "8:73": "Then rising up from the fast with my clothes and the holy garment rent, and bowing my knees, and stretching forth my hands unto the Lord,",
        "8:74": "I said, O Lord, I am confounded and ashamed before thy face;",
        "8:75": "For our sins are multiplied above our heads, and our ignorances have reached up unto heaven.",
        "8:76": "For ever since the time of our fathers we have been and are in great sin, even unto this day.",
        "8:77": "And for our sins and our fathers’ we with our brethren and our kings and our priests were given up unto the kings of the earth, to the sword, and to captivity, and for a prey with shame, unto this day.",
        "8:78": "And now in some measure hath mercy been shewed unto us from thee, O Lord, that there should be left us a root and a name in the place of thy sanctuary;",
        "8:79": "And to discover unto us a light in the house of the Lord our God, and to give us food in the time of our servitude.",
        "8:80": "Yea, when we were in bondage, we were not forsaken of our Lord; but he made us gracious before the kings of Persia, so that they gave us food;",
        "8:81": "Yea, and honoured the temple of our Lord, and raised up the desolate Sion, that they have given us a sure abiding in Jewry and Jerusalem.",
        "8:82": "And now, O Lord, what shall we say, having these things? for we have transgressed thy commandments, which thou gavest by the hand of thy servants the prophets, saying,",
        "8:83": "That the land, which ye enter into to possess as an heritage, is a land polluted with the pollutions of the strangers of the land, and they have filled it with their uncleanness.",
        "8:84": "Therefore now shall ye not join your daughters unto their sons, neither shall ye take their daughters unto your sons.",
        "8:85": "Moreover ye shall never seek to have peace with them, that ye may be strong, and eat the good things of the land, and that ye may leave the inheritance of the land unto your children for evermore.",
        "8:86": "And all that is befallen is done unto us for our wicked works and great sins; for thou, O Lord, didst make our sins light,",
        "8:87": "And didst give unto us such a root: but we have turned back again to transgress thy law, and to mingle ourselves with the uncleanness of the nations of the land.",
        "8:88": "Mightest not thou be angry with us to destroy us, till thou hadst left us neither root, seed, nor name?",
        "8:89": "O Lord of Israel, thou art true: for we are left a root this day.",
        "8:90": "Behold, now are we before thee in our iniquities, for we cannot stand any longer by reason of these things before thee.",
        "8:91": "And as Esdras in his prayer made his confession, weeping, and lying flat upon the ground before the temple, there gathered unto him from Jerusalem a very great multitude of men and women and children: for there was great weeping among the multitude.",
        "8:92": "Then Jechonias the son of Jeelus, one of the sons of Israel, called out, and said, O Esdras, we have sinned against the Lord God, we have married strange women of the nations of the land, and now is all Israel aloft.",
        "8:93": "Let us make an oath to the Lord, that we will put away all our wives, which we have taken of the heathen, with their children,",
        "8:94": "Like as thou hast decreed, and as many as do obey the law of the Lord.",
        "8:95": "Arise and put in execution: for to thee doth this matter appertain, and we will be with thee: do valiantly.",
        "8:96": "So Esdras arose, and took an oath of the chief of the priests and Levites of all Israel to do after these things; and so they sware.",
        "9:1": "Then Esdras rising from the court of the temple went to the chamber of Joanan the son of Eliasib,",
        "9:2": "And remained there, and did eat no meat nor drink water, mourning for the great iniquities of the multitude.",
        "9:3": "And there was a proclamation in all Jewry and Jerusalem to all them that were of the captivity, that they should be gathered together at Jerusalem:",
        "9:4": "And that whosoever met not there within two or three days according as the elders that bare rule appointed, their cattle should be seized to the use of the temple, and himself cast out from them that were of the captivity.",
        "9:5": "And in three days were all they of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin gathered together at Jerusalem the twentieth day of the ninth month.",
        "9:6": "And all the multitude sat trembling in the broad court of the temple because of the present foul weather.",
        "9:7": "So Esdras arose up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed the law in marrying strange wives, thereby to increase the sins of Israel.",
        "9:8": "And now by confessing give glory unto the Lord God of our fathers,",
        "9:9": "And do his will, and separate yourselves from the heathen of the land, and from the strange women.",
        "9:10": "Then cried the whole multitude, and said with a loud voice, Like as thou hast spoken, so will we do.",
        "9:11": "But forasmuch as the people are many, and it is foul weather, so that we cannot stand without, and this is not a work of a day or two, seeing our sin in these things is spread far:",
        "9:12": "Therefore let the rulers of the multitude stay, and let all them of our habitations that have strange wives come at the time appointed,",
        "9:13": "And with them the rulers and judges of every place, till we turn away the wrath of the Lord from us for this matter.",
        "9:14": "Then Jonathan the son of Azael and Ezechias the son of Theocanus accordingly took this matter upon them: and Mosollam and Levis and Sabbatheus helped them.",
        "9:15": "And they that were of the captivity did according to all these things.",
        "9:16": "And Esdras the priest chose unto him the principal men of their families, all by name: and in the first day of the tenth month they sat together to examine the matter.",
        "9:17": "So their cause that held strange wives was brought to an end in the first day of the first month.",
        "9:18": "And of the priests that were come together, and had strange wives, there were found:",
        "9:19": "Of the sons of Jesus the son of Josedec, and his brethren; Matthelas and Eleazar, and Joribus and Joadanus.",

        "3:20": "And yet tookest thou not away from them a wicked heart, that thy law might bring forth fruit in them.",
        "3:21": "For the first Adam bearing a wicked heart transgressed, and was overcome; and so be all they that are born of him.",

        "3:24": "Whom thou commandedst to build a city unto thy name, and to offer incense and oblations unto thee therein.",
        "3:25": "When this was done many years, then they that inhabited the city forsook thee,",
        "3:26": "And in all things did even as Adam and all his generations had done: for they also had a wicked heart:",
        "3:27": "And so thou gavest thy city over into the hands of thine enemies.",
        "3:28": "Are their deeds then any better that inhabit Babylon, that they should therefore have the dominion over Sion?",
        "3:29": "For when I came thither, and had seen impieties without number, then my soul saw many evildoers in this thirtieth year, so that my heart failed me.",
        "3:30": "For I have seen how thou sufferest them sinning, and hast spared wicked doers: and hast destroyed thy people, and hast preserved thine enemies, and hast not signified it.",
        "3:31": "I do not remember how this way may be left: Are they then of Babylon better than they of Sion?",
        "3:32": "Or is there any other people that knoweth thee beside Israel? or what generation hath so believed thy covenants as Jacob?",
        "3:33": "And yet their reward appeareth not, and their labour hath no fruit: for I have gone here and there through the heathen, and I see that they flow in wealth, and think not upon thy commandments.",
        "3:34": "Weigh thou therefore our wickedness now in the balance, and their’s also that dwell the world; and so shall thy name no where be found but in Israel.",
        "3:35": "Or when was it that they which dwell upon the earth have not sinned in thy sight? or what people have so kept thy commandments?",
        "3:36": "Thou shalt find that Israel by name hath kept thy precepts; but not the heathen.",
        "4:1": "And the angel that was sent unto me, whose name was Uriel, gave me an answer,",
        "4:2": "And said, Thy heart hath gone to far in this world, and thinkest thou to comprehend the way of the most High?",
        "4:3": "Then said I, Yea, my lord. And he answered me, and said, I am sent to shew thee three ways, and to set forth three similitudes before thee:",
        "4:4": "Whereof if thou canst declare me one, I will shew thee also the way that thou desirest to see, and I shall shew thee from whence the wicked heart cometh.",
        "4:5": "And I said, Tell on, my lord. Then said he unto me, Go thy way, weigh me the weight of the fire, or measure me the blast of the wind, or call me again the day that is past.",
        "4:6": "Then answered I and said, What man is able to do that, that thou shouldest ask such things of me?",
        "4:7": "And he said unto me, If I should ask thee how great dwellings are in the midst of the sea, or how many springs are in the beginning of the deep, or how many springs are above the firmament, or which are the outgoings of paradise:",
        "4:8": "Peradventure thou wouldest say unto me, I never went down into the deep, nor as yet into hell, neither did I ever climb up into heaven.",
        "4:9": "Nevertheless now have I asked thee but only of the fire and wind, and of the day wherethrough thou hast passed, and of things from which thou canst not be separated, and yet canst thou give me no answer of them.",
        "4:10": "He said moreover unto me, Thine own things, and such as are grown up with thee, canst thou not know;",
        "4:11": "How should thy vessel then be able to comprehend the way of the Highest, and, the world being now outwardly corrupted to understand the corruption that is evident in my sight?",
        "4:12": "Then said I unto him, It were better that we were not at all, than that we should live still in wickedness, and to suffer, and not to know wherefore.",
        "4:13": "He answered me, and said, I went into a forest into a plain, and the trees took counsel,",
        "4:14": "And said, Come, let us go and make war against the sea that it may depart away before us, and that we may make us more woods.",
        "4:15": "The floods of the sea also in like manner took counsel, and said, Come, let us go up and subdue the woods of the plain, that there also we may make us another country.",
        "4:16": "The thought of the wood was in vain, for the fire came and consumed it.",
        "4:17": "The thought of the floods of the sea came likewise to nought, for the sand stood up and stopped them.",
        "4:18": "If thou wert judge now betwixt these two, whom wouldest thou begin to justify? or whom wouldest thou condemn?",
        "4:19": "I answered and said, Verily it is a foolish thought that they both have devised, for the ground is given unto the wood, and the sea also hath his place to bear his floods.",
        "4:20": "Then answered he me, and said, Thou hast given a right judgment, but why judgest thou not thyself also?",
        "4:21": "For like as the ground is given unto the wood, and the sea to his floods: even so they that dwell upon the earth may understand nothing but that which is upon the earth: and he that dwelleth above the heavens may only understand the things that are above the height of the heavens.",
        "4:22": "Then answered I and said, I beseech thee, O Lord, let me have understanding:",
        "4:23": "For it was not my mind to be curious of the high things, but of such as pass by us daily, namely, wherefore Israel is given up as a reproach to the heathen, and for what cause the people whom thou hast loved is given over unto ungodly nations, and why the law of our forefathers is brought to nought, and the written covenants come to none effect,",
        "4:24": "And we pass away out of the world as grasshoppers, and our life is astonishment and fear, and we are not worthy to obtain mercy.",
        "4:25": "What will he then do unto his name whereby we are called? of these things have I asked.",
        "4:26": "Then answered he me, and said, The more thou searchest, the more thou shalt marvel; for the world hasteth fast to pass away,",
        "4:27": "And cannot comprehend the things that are promised to the righteous in time to come: for this world is full of unrighteousness and infirmities.",
        "4:28": "But as concerning the things whereof thou askest me, I will tell thee; for the evil is sown, but the destruction thereof is not yet come.",
        "4:29": "If therefore that which is sown be not turned upside down, and if the place where the evil is sown pass not away, then cannot it come that is sown with good.",
        "4:30": "For the grain of evil seed hath been sown in the heart of Adam from the beginning, and how much ungodliness hath it brought up unto this time? and how much shall it yet bring forth until the time of threshing come?",
        "4:31": "Ponder now by thyself, how great fruit of wickedness the grain of evil seed hath brought forth.",
        "4:32": "And when the ears shall be cut down, which are without number, how great a floor shall they fill?",
        "4:33": "Then I answered and said, How, and when shall these things come to pass? wherefore are our years few and evil?",
        "4:34": "And he answered me, saying, Do not thou hasten above the most Highest: for thy haste is in vain to be above him, for thou hast much exceeded.",
        "4:35": "Did not the souls also of the righteous ask question of these things in their chambers, saying, How long shall I hope on this fashion? when cometh the fruit of the floor of our reward?",
        "4:36": "And unto these things Uriel the archangel gave them answer, and said, Even when the number of seeds is filled in you: for he hath weighed the world in the balance.",
        "4:37": "By measure hath he measured the times; and by number hath he numbered the times; and he doth not move nor stir them, until the said measure be fulfilled.",
        "4:38": "Then answered I and said, O Lord that bearest rule, even we all are full of impiety.",
        "4:39": "And for our sakes peradventure it is that the floors of the righteous are not filled, because of the sins of them that dwell upon the earth.",
        "4:40": "So he answered me, and said, Go thy way to a woman with child, and ask of her when she hath fulfilled her nine months, if her womb may keep the birth any longer within her.",
        "4:41": "Then said I, No, Lord, that can she not. And he said unto me, In the grave the chambers of souls are like the womb of a woman:",
        "4:42": "For like as a woman that travaileth maketh haste to escape the necessity of the travail: even so do these places haste to deliver those things that are committed unto them.",
        "4:43": "From the beginning, look, what thou desirest to see, it shall be shewed thee.",
        "4:44": "Then answered I and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, and if it be possible, and if I be meet therefore,",
        "4:45": "Shew me then whether there be more to come than is past, or more past than is to come.",
        "4:46": "What is past I know, but what is for to come I know not.",
        "4:47": "And he said unto me, Stand up upon the right side, and I shall expound the similitude unto thee.",
        "4:48": "So I stood, and saw, and, behold, an hot burning oven passed by before me: and it happened that when the flame was gone by I looked, and, behold, the smoke remained still.",
        "4:49": "After this there passed by before me a watery cloud, and sent down much rain with a storm; and when the stormy rain was past, the drops remained still.",
        "4:50": "Then said he unto me, Consider with thyself; as the rain is more than the drops, and as the fire is greater than the smoke; but the drops and the smoke remain behind: so the quantity which is past did more exceed.",
        "4:51": "Then I prayed, and said, May I live, thinkest thou, until that time? or what shall happen in those days?",
        "4:52": "He answered me, and said, As for the tokens whereof thou askest me, I may tell thee of them in part: but as touching thy life, I am not sent to shew thee; for I do not know it.",
        "5:1": "Nevertheless as coming the tokens, behold, the days shall come, that they which dwell upon earth shall be taken in a great number, and the way of truth shall be hidden, and the land shall be barren of faith.",
        "5:2": "But iniquity shall be increased above that which now thou seest, or that thou hast heard long ago.",
        "5:3": "And the land, that thou seest now to have root, shalt thou see wasted suddenly.",
        "5:4": "But if the most High grant thee to live, thou shalt see after the third trumpet that the sun shall suddenly shine again in the night, and the moon thrice in the day:",
        "5:5": "And blood shall drop out of wood, and the stone shall give his voice, and the people shall be troubled:",
        "5:6": "And even he shall rule, whom they look not for that dwell upon the earth, and the fowls shall take their flight away together:",
        "5:7": "And the Sodomitish sea shall cast out fish, and make a noise in the night, which many have not known: but they shall all hear the voice thereof.",
        "5:8": "There shall be a confusion also in many places, and the fire shall be oft sent out again, and the wild beasts shall change their places, and menstruous women shall bring forth monsters:",
        "5:9": "And salt waters shall be found in the sweet, and all friends shall destroy one another; then shall wit hide itself, and understanding withdraw itself into his secret chamber,",
        "5:10": "And shall be sought of many, and yet not be found: then shall unrighteousness and incontinency be multiplied upon earth.",
        "5:11": "One land also shall ask another, and say, Is righteousness that maketh a man righteous gone through thee? And it shall say, No.",
        "5:12": "At the same time shall men hope, but nothing obtain: they shall labour, but their ways shall not prosper.",
        "5:13": "To shew thee such tokens I have leave; and if thou wilt pray again, and weep as now, and fast even days, thou shalt hear yet greater things.",
        "5:14": "Then I awaked, and an extreme fearfulness went through all my body, and my mind was troubled, so that it fainted.",
        "5:15": "So the angel that was come to talk with me held me, comforted me, and set me up upon my feet.",
        "5:16": "And in the second night it came to pass, that Salathiel the captain of the people came unto me, saying, Where hast thou been? and why is thy countenance so heavy?",
        "5:17": "Knowest thou not that Israel is committed unto thee in the land of their captivity?",
        "5:18": "Up then, and eat bread, and forsake us not, as the shepherd that leaveth his flock in the hands of cruel wolves.",
        "5:19": "Then said I unto him, Go thy ways from me, and come not nigh me. And he heard what I said, and went from me.",
        "5:20": "And so I fasted seven days, mourning and weeping, like as Uriel the angel commanded me.",
        "5:21": "And after seven days so it was, that the thoughts of my heart were very grievous unto me again,",
        "5:22": "And my soul recovered the spirit of understanding, and I began to talk with the most High again,",
        "5:23": "And said, O Lord that bearest rule, of every wood of the earth, and of all the trees thereof, thou hast chosen thee one only vine:",
        "5:24": "And of all lands of the whole world thou hast chosen thee one pit: and of all the flowers thereof one lily:",
        "5:25": "And of all the depths of the sea thou hast filled thee one river: and of all builded cities thou hast hallowed Sion unto thyself:",
        "5:26": "And of all the fowls that are created thou hast named thee one dove: and of all the cattle that are made thou hast provided thee one sheep:",
        "5:27": "And among all the multitudes of people thou hast gotten thee one people: and unto this people, whom thou lovedst, thou gavest a law that is approved of all.",
        "5:28": "And now, O Lord, why hast thou given this one people over unto many? and upon the one root hast thou prepared others, and why hast thou scattered thy only one people among many?",
        "5:29": "And they which did gainsay thy promises, and believed not thy covenants, have trodden them down.",
        "5:30": "If thou didst so much hate thy people, yet shouldest thou punish them with thine own hands.",
        "5:31": "Now when I had spoken these words, the angel that came to me the night afore was sent unto me,",
        "5:32": "And said unto me, Hear me, and I will instruct thee; hearken to the thing that I say, and I shall tell thee more.",
        "5:33": "And I said, Speak on, my Lord. Then said he unto me, Thou art sore troubled in mind for Israel’s sake: lovest thou that people better than he that made them?",
        "5:34": "And I said, No, Lord: but of very grief have I spoken: for my reins pain me every hour, while I labour to comprehend the way of the most High, and to seek out part of his judgment.",
        "5:35": "And he said unto me, Thou canst not. And I said, Wherefore, Lord? whereunto was I born then? or why was not my mother’s womb then my grave, that I might not have seen the travail of Jacob, and the wearisome toil of the stock of Israel?",
        "5:36": "And he said unto me, Number me the things that are not yet come, gather me together the dross that are scattered abroad, make me the flowers green again that are withered,",
        "5:37": "Open me the places that are closed, and bring me forth the winds that in them are shut up, shew me the image of a voice: and then I will declare to thee the thing that thou labourest to know.",
        "5:38": "And I said, O Lord that bearest rule, who may know these things, but he that hath not his dwelling with men?",
        "5:39": "As for me, I am unwise: how may I then speak of these things whereof thou askest me?",
        "5:40": "Then said he unto me, Like as thou canst do none of these things that I have spoken of, even so canst thou not find out my judgment, or in the end the love that I have promised unto my people.",
        "5:41": "And I said, Behold, O Lord, yet art thou nigh unto them that be reserved till the end: and what shall they do that have been before me, or we that be now, or they that shall come after us?",
        "5:42": "And he said unto me, I will liken my judgment unto a ring: like as there is no slackness of the last, even so there is no swiftness of the first.",
        "5:43": "So I answered and said, Couldest thou not make those that have been made, and be now, and that are for to come, at once; that thou mightest shew thy judgment the sooner?",
        "5:44": "Then answered he me, and said, The creature may not haste above the maker; neither may the world hold them at once that shall be created therein.",
        "5:45": "And I said, As thou hast said unto thy servant, that thou, which givest life to all, hast given life at once to the creature that thou hast created, and the creature bare it: even so it might now also bear them that now be present at once.",
        "5:46": "And he said unto me, Ask the womb of a woman, and say unto her, If thou bringest forth children, why dost thou it not together, but one after another? pray her therefore to bring forth ten children at once.",
        "5:47": "And I said, She cannot: but must do it by distance of time.",
        "5:48": "Then said he unto me, Even so have I given the womb of the earth to those that be sown in it in their times.",
        "5:49": "For like as a young child may not bring forth the things that belong to the aged, even so have I disposed the world which I created.",
        "5:50": "And I asked, and said, Seeing thou hast now given me the way, I will proceed to speak before thee: for our mother, of whom thou hast told me that she is young, draweth now nigh unto age.",
        "5:51": "He answered me, and said, Ask a woman that beareth children, and she shall tell thee.",
        "5:52": "Say unto her, Wherefore are unto they whom thou hast now brought forth like those that were before, but less of stature?",
        "5:53": "And she shall answer thee, They that be born in the the strength of youth are of one fashion, and they that are born in the time of age, when the womb faileth, are otherwise.",
        "5:54": "Consider thou therefore also, how that ye are less of stature than those that were before you.",
        "5:55": "And so are they that come after you less than ye, as the creatures which now begin to be old, and have passed over the strength of youth.",
        "5:56": "Then said I, Lord, I beseech thee, if I have found favour in thy sight, shew thy servant by whom thou visitest thy creature.",
        "6:1": "And he said unto me, In the beginning, when the earth was made, before the borders of the world stood, or ever the winds blew,",
        "6:2": "Before it thundered and lightened, or ever the foundations of paradise were laid,",
        "6:3": "Before the fair flowers were seen, or ever the moveable powers were established, before the innumerable multitude of angels were gathered together,",
        "6:4": "Or ever the heights of the air were lifted up, before the measures of the firmament were named, or ever the chimneys in Sion were hot,",
        "6:5": "And ere the present years were sought out, and or ever the inventions of them that now sin were turned, before they were sealed that have gathered faith for a treasure:",
        "6:6": "Then did I consider these things, and they all were made through me alone, and through none other: by me also they shall be ended, and by none other.",
        "6:7": "Then answered I and said, What shall be the parting asunder of the times? or when shall be the end of the first, and the beginning of it that followeth?",
        "6:8": "And he said unto me, From Abraham unto Isaac, when Jacob and Esau were born of him, Jacob’s hand held first the heel of Esau.",
        "6:9": "For Esau is the end of the world, and Jacob is the beginning of it that followeth.",
        "6:10": "The hand of man is betwixt the heel and the hand: other question, Esdras, ask thou not.",
        "6:11": "I answered then and said, O Lord that bearest rule, if I have found favour in thy sight,",
        "6:12": "I beseech thee, shew thy servant the end of thy tokens, whereof thou shewedst me part the last night.",
        "6:13": "So he answered and said unto me, Stand up upon thy feet, and hear a mighty sounding voice.",
        "6:14": "And it shall be as it were a great motion; but the place where thou standest shall not be moved.",
        "6:15": "And therefore when it speaketh be not afraid: for the word is of the end, and the foundation of the earth is understood.",
        "6:16": "And why? because the speech of these things trembleth and is moved: for it knoweth that the end of these things must be changed.",
        "6:17": "And it happened, that when I had heard it I stood up upon my feet, and hearkened, and, behold, there was a voice that spake, and the sound of it was like the sound of many waters.",
        "6:18": "And it said, Behold, the days come, that I will begin to draw nigh, and to visit them that dwell upon the earth,",
        "6:19": "And will begin to make inquisition of them, what they be that have hurt unjustly with their unrighteousness, and when the affliction of Sion shall be fulfilled;",
        "6:20": "And when the world, that shall begin to vanish away, shall be finished, then will I shew these tokens: the books shall be opened before the firmament, and they shall see all together:",
        "6:21": "And the children of a year old shall speak with their voices, the women with child shall bring forth untimely children of three or four months old, and they shall live, and be raised up.",
        "6:22": "And suddenly shall the sown places appear unsown, the full storehouses shall suddenly be found empty:",
        "6:23": "And tha trumpet shall give a sound, which when every man heareth, they shall be suddenly afraid.",
        "6:24": "At that time shall friends fight one against another like enemies, and the earth shall stand in fear with those that dwell therein, the springs of the fountains shall stand still, and in three hours they shall not run.",
        "6:25": "Whosoever remaineth from all these that I have told thee shall escape, and see my salvation, and the end of your world.",
        "6:26": "And the men that are received shall see it, who have not tasted death from their birth: and the heart of the inhabitants shall be changed, and turned into another meaning.",
        "6:27": "For evil shall be put out, and deceit shall be quenched.",
        "6:28": "As for faith, it shall flourish, corruption shall be overcome, and the truth, which hath been so long without fruit, shall be declared.",
        "6:29": "And when he talked with me, behold, I looked by little and little upon him before whom I stood.",
        "6:30": "And these words said he unto me; I am come to shew thee the time of the night to come.",
        "6:31": "If thou wilt pray yet more, and fast seven days again, I shall tell thee greater things by day than I have heard.",
        "6:32": "For thy voice is heard before the most High: for the Mighty hath seen thy righteous dealing, he hath seen also thy chastity, which thou hast had ever since thy youth.",
        "6:33": "And therefore hath he sent me to shew thee all these things, and to say unto thee, Be of good comfort and fear not",
        "6:34": "And hasten not with the times that are past, to think vain things, that thou mayest not hasten from the latter times.",
        "6:35": "And it came to pass after this, that I wept again, and fasted seven days in like manner, that I might fulfil the three weeks which he told me.",
        "6:36": "And in the eighth night was my heart vexed within me again, and I began to speak before the most High.",
        "6:37": "For my spirit was greatly set on fire, and my soul was in distress.",
        "6:38": "And I said, O Lord, thou spakest from the beginning of the creation, even the first day, and saidst thus; Let heaven and earth be made; and thy word was a perfect work.",
        "6:39": "And then was the spirit, and darkness and silence were on every side; the sound of man’s voice was not yet formed.",
        "6:40": "Then commandedst thou a fair light to come forth of thy treasures, that thy work might appear.",
        "6:41": "Upon the second day thou madest the spirit of the firmament, and commandedst it to part asunder, and to make a division betwixt the waters, that the one part might go up, and the other remain beneath.",
        "6:42": "Upon the third day thou didst command that the waters should be gathered in the seventh part of the earth: six pats hast thou dried up, and kept them, to the intent that of these some being planted of God and tilled might serve thee.",
        "6:43": "For as soon as thy word went forth the work was made.",
        "6:44": "For immediately there was great and innumerable fruit, and many and divers pleasures for the taste, and flowers of unchangeable colour, and odours of wonderful smell: and this was done the third day.",
        "6:45": "Upon the fourth day thou commandedst that the sun should shine, and the moon give her light, and the stars should be in order:",
        "6:46": "And gavest them a charge to do service unto man, that was to be made.",
        "6:47": "Upon the fifth day thou saidst unto the seventh part, where the waters were gathered that it should bring forth living creatures, fowls and fishes: and so it came to pass.",
        "6:48": "For the dumb water and without life brought forth living things at the commandment of God, that all people might praise thy wondrous works.",
        "6:49": "Then didst thou ordain two living creatures, the one thou calledst Enoch, and the other Leviathan;",
        "6:50": "And didst separate the one from the other: for the seventh part, namely, where the water was gathered together, might not hold them both.",
        "6:51": "Unto Enoch thou gavest one part, which was dried up the third day, that he should dwell in the same part, wherein are a thousand hills:",
        "6:52": "But unto Leviathan thou gavest the seventh part, namely, the moist; and hast kept him to be devoured of whom thou wilt, and when.",
        "6:53": "Upon the sixth day thou gavest commandment unto the earth, that before thee it should bring forth beasts, cattle, and creeping things:",
        "6:54": "And after these, Adam also, whom thou madest lord of all thy creatures: of him come we all, and the people also whom thou hast chosen.",
        "6:55": "All this have I spoken before thee, O Lord, because thou madest the world for our sakes",
        "6:56": "As for the other people, which also come of Adam, thou hast said that they are nothing, but be like unto spittle: and hast likened the abundance of them unto a drop that falleth from a vessel.",
        "6:57": "And now, O Lord, behold, these heathen, which have ever been reputed as nothing, have begun to be lords over us, and to devour us.",
        "6:58": "But we thy people, whom thou hast called thy firstborn, thy only begotten, and thy fervent lover, are given into their hands.",
        "6:59": "If the world now be made for our sakes, why do we not possess an inheritance with the world? how long shall this endure?",
        "7:1": "And when I had made an end of speaking these words, there was sent unto me the angel which had been sent unto me the nights afore:",
        "7:2": "And he said unto me, Up, Esdras, and hear the words that I am come to tell thee.",
        "7:3": "And I said, Speak on, my God. Then said he unto me, The sea is set in a wide place, that it might be deep and great.",
        "7:4": "But put the case the entrance were narrow, and like a river;",
        "7:5": "Who then could go into the sea to look upon it, and to rule it? if he went not through the narrow, how could he come into the broad?",
        "7:6": "There is also another thing; A city is builded, and set upon a broad field, and is full of all good things:",
        "7:7": "The entrance thereof is narrow, and is set in a dangerous place to fall, like as if there were a fire on the right hand, and on the left a deep water:",
        "7:8": "And one only path between them both, even between the fire and the water, so small that there could but one man go there at once.",
        "7:9": "If this city now were given unto a man for an inheritance, if he never shall pass the danger set before it, how shall he receive this inheritance?",
        "7:10": "And I said, It is so, Lord. Then said he unto me, Even so also is Israel’s portion.",
        "7:11": "Because for their sakes I made the world: and when Adam transgressed my statutes, then was decreed that now is done.",
        "7:12": "Then were the entrances of this world made narrow, full of sorrow and travail: they are but few and evil, full of perils,: and very painful.",
        "7:13": "For the entrances of the elder world were wide and sure, and brought immortal fruit.",
        "7:14": "If then they that live labour not to enter these strait and vain things, they can never receive those that are laid up for them.",
        "7:15": "Now therefore why disquietest thou thyself, seeing thou art but a corruptible man? and why art thou moved, whereas thou art but mortal?",
        "7:16": "Why hast thou not considered in thy mind this thing that is to come, rather than that which is present?",
        "7:17": "Then answered I and said, O Lord that bearest rule, thou hast ordained in thy law, that the righteous should inherit these things, but that the ungodly should perish.",
        "7:18": "Nevertheless the righteous shall suffer strait things, and hope for wide: for they that have done wickedly have suffered the strait things, and yet shall not see the wide.",
        "7:19": "And he said unto me. There is no judge above God, and none that hath understanding above the Highest.",
        "7:20": "For there be many that perish in this life, because they despise the law of God that is set before them.",
        "7:21": "For God hath given strait commandment to such as came, what they should do to live, even as they came, and what they should observe to avoid punishment.",
        "7:22": "Nevertheless they were not obedient unto him; but spake against him, and imagined vain things;",
        "7:23": "And deceived themselves by their wicked deeds; and said of the most High, that he is not; and knew not his ways:",
        "7:24": "But his law have they despised, and denied his covenants; in his statutes have they not been faithful, and have not performed his works.",
        "7:25": "And therefore, Esdras, for the empty are empty things, and for the full are the full things.",
        "7:26": "Behold, the time shall come, that these tokens which I have told thee shall come to pass, and the bride shall appear, and she coming forth shall be seen, that now is withdrawn from the earth.",
        "7:27": "And whosoever is delivered from the foresaid evils shall see my wonders.",
        "7:28": "For my son Jesus shall be revealed with those that be with him, and they that remain shall rejoice within four hundred years.",
        "7:29": "After these years shall my son Christ die, and all men that have life.",
        "7:30": "And the world shall be turned into the old silence seven days, like as in the former judgments: so that no man shall remain.",
        "7:31": "And after seven days the world, that yet awaketh not, shall be raised up, and that shall die that is corrupt",
        "7:32": "And the earth shall restore those that are asleep in her, and so shall the dust those that dwell in silence, and the secret places shall deliver those souls that were committed unto them.",
        "7:33": "And the most High shall appear upon the seat of judgment, and misery shall pass away, and the long suffering shall have an end:",
        "7:34": "But judgment only shall remain, truth shall stand, and faith shall wax strong:",
        "7:35": "And the work shall follow, and the reward shall be shewed, and the good deeds shall be of force, and wicked deeds shall bear no rule.",
        "7:36": "Then said I, Abraham prayed first for the Sodomites, and Moses for the fathers that sinned in the wilderness:",
        "7:37": "And Jesus after him for Israel in the time of Achan:",
        "7:38": "And Samuel and David for the destruction: and Solomon for them that should come to the sanctuary:",
        "7:39": "And Helias for those that received rain; and for the dead, that he might live:",
        "7:40": "And Ezechias for the people in the time of Sennacherib: and many for many.",
        "7:41": "Even so now, seeing corruption is grown up, and wickedness increased, and the righteous have prayed for the ungodly: wherefore shall it not be so now also?",
        "7:42": "He answered me, and said, This present life is not the end where much glory doth abide; therefore have they prayed for the weak.",
        "7:43": "But the day of doom shall be the end of this time, and the beginning of the immortality for to come, wherein corruption is past,",
        "7:44": "Intemperance is at an end, infidelity is cut off, righteousness is grown, and truth is sprung up.",
        "7:45": "Then shall no man be able to save him that is destroyed, nor to oppress him that hath gotten the victory.",
        "7:46": "I answered then and said, This is my first and last saying, that it had been better not to have given the earth unto Adam: or else, when it was given him, to have restrained him from sinning.",
        "7:47": "For what profit is it for men now in this present time to live in heaviness, and after death to look for punishment?",
        "7:48": "O thou Adam, what hast thou done? for though it was thou that sinned, thou art not fallen alone, but we all that come of thee.",
        "7:49": "For what profit is it unto us, if there be promised us an immortal time, whereas we have done the works that bring death?",
        "7:50": "And that there is promised us an everlasting hope, whereas ourselves being most wicked are made vain?",
        "7:51": "And that there are laid up for us dwellings of health and safety, whereas we have lived wickedly?",
        "7:52": "And that the glory of the most High is kept to defend them which have led a wary life, whereas we have walked in the most wicked ways of all?",
        "7:53": "And that there should be shewed a paradise, whose fruit endureth for ever, wherein is security and medicine, since we shall not enter into it?",
        "7:54": "(For we have walked in unpleasant places.)",
        "7:55": "And that the faces of them which have used abstinence shall shine above the stars, whereas our faces shall be blacker than darkness?",
        "7:56": "For while we lived and committed iniquity, we considered not that we should begin to suffer for it after death.",
        "7:57": "Then answered he me, and said, This is the condition of the battle, which man that is born upon the earth shall fight;",
        "7:58": "That, if he be overcome, he shall suffer as thou hast said: but if he get the victory, he shall receive the thing that I say.",
        "7:59": "For this is the life whereof Moses spake unto the people while he lived, saying, Choose thee life, that thou mayest live.",
        "7:60": "Nevertheless they believed not him, nor yet the prophets after him, no nor me which have spoken unto them,",
        "7:61": "That there should not be such heaviness in their destruction, as shall be joy over them that are persuaded to salvation.",
        "7:62": "I answered then, and said, I know, Lord, that the most High is called merciful, in that he hath mercy upon them which are not yet come into the world,",
        "7:63": "And upon those also that turn to his law;",
        "7:64": "And that he is patient, and long suffereth those that have sinned, as his creatures;",
        "7:65": "And that he is bountiful, for he is ready to give where it needeth;",
        "7:66": "And that he is of great mercy, for he multiplieth more and more mercies to them that are present, and that are past, and also to them which are to come.",
        "7:67": "For if he shall not multiply his mercies, the world would not continue with them that inherit therein.",
        "7:68": "And he pardoneth; for if he did not so of his goodness, that they which have committed iniquities might be eased of them, the ten thousandth part of men should not remain living.",
        "7:69": "And being judge, if he should not forgive them that are cured with his word, and put out the multitude of contentions,",
        "7:70": "There should be very few left peradventure in an innumerable multitude.",
        "8:1": "And he answered me, saying, The most High hath made this world for many, but the world to come for few.",
        "8:2": "I will tell thee a similitude, Esdras; As when thou askest the earth, it shall say unto thee, that it giveth much mould whereof earthen vessels are made, but little dust that gold cometh of: even so is the course of this present world.",
        "8:3": "There be many created, but few shall be saved.",
        "8:4": "So answered I and said, Swallow then down, O my soul, understanding, and devour wisdom.",
        "8:5": "For thou hast agreed to give ear, and art willing to prophesy: for thou hast no longer space than only to live.",
        "8:6": "O Lord, if thou suffer not thy servant, that we may pray before thee, and thou give us seed unto our heart, and culture to our understanding, that there may come fruit of it; how shall each man live that is corrupt, who beareth the place of a man?",
        "8:7": "For thou art alone, and we all one workmanship of thine hands, like as thou hast said.",
        "8:8": "For when the body is fashioned now in the mother’s womb, and thou givest it members, thy creature is preserved in fire and water, and nine months doth thy workmanship endure thy creature which is created in her.",
        "8:9": "But that which keepeth and is kept shall both be preserved: and when the time cometh, the womb preserved delivereth up the things that grew in it.",
        "8:10": "For thou hast commanded out of the parts of the body, that is to say, out of the breasts, milk to be given, which is the fruit of the breasts,",
        "8:11": "That the thing which is fashioned may be nourished for a time, till thou disposest it to thy mercy.",
        "8:12": "Thou broughtest it up with thy righteousness, and nurturedst it in thy law, and reformedst it with thy judgment.",
        "8:13": "And thou shalt mortify it as thy creature, and quicken it as thy work.",
        "8:14": "If therefore thou shalt destroy him which with so great labour was fashioned, it is an easy thing to be ordained by thy commandment, that the thing which was made might be preserved.",
        "8:15": "Now therefore, Lord, I will speak; touching man in general, thou knowest best; but touching thy people, for whose sake I am sorry;",
        "8:16": "And for thine inheritance, for whose cause I mourn; and for Israel, for whom I am heavy; and for Jacob, for whose sake I am troubled;",
        "8:17": "Therefore will I begin to pray before thee for myself and for them: for I see the falls of us that dwell in the land.",
        "8:18": "But I have heard the swiftness of the judge which is to come.",
        "8:19": "Therefore hear my voice, and understand my words, and I shall speak before thee. This is the beginning of the words of Esdras, before he was taken up: and I said,",
        "8:20": "O Lord, thou that dwellest in everlastingness which beholdest from above things in the heaven and in the air;",
        "8:21": "Whose throne is inestimable; whose glory may not be comprehended; before whom the hosts of angels stand with trembling,",
        "8:22": "Whose service is conversant in wind and fire; whose word is true, and sayings constant; whose commandment is strong, and ordinance fearful;",
        "8:23": "Whose look drieth up the depths, and indignation maketh the mountains to melt away; which the truth witnesseth:",
        "8:24": "O hear the prayer of thy servant, and give ear to the petition of thy creature.",
        "8:25": "For while I live I will speak, and so long as I have understanding I will answer.",
        "8:26": "O look not upon the sins of thy people; but on them which serve thee in truth.",
        "8:27": "Regard not the wicked inventions of the heathen, but the desire of those that keep thy testimonies in afflictions.",
        "8:28": "Think not upon those that have walked feignedly before thee: but remember them, which according to thy will have known thy fear.",
        "8:29": "Let it not be thy will to destroy them which have lived like beasts; but to look upon them that have clearly taught thy law.",
        "8:30": "Take thou no indignation at them which are deemed worse than beasts; but love them that always put their trust in thy righteousness and glory.",
        "8:31": "For we and our fathers do languish of such diseases: but because of us sinners thou shalt be called merciful.",
        "8:32": "For if thou hast a desire to have mercy upon us, thou shalt be called merciful, to us namely, that have no works of righteousness.",
        "8:33": "For the just, which have many good works laid up with thee, shall out of their own deeds receive reward.",
        "8:34": "For what is man, that thou shouldest take displeasure at him? or what is a corruptible generation, that thou shouldest be so bitter toward it?",
        "8:35": "For in truth them is no man among them that be born, but he hath dealt wickedly; and among the faithful there is none which hath not done amiss.",
        "8:36": "For in this, O Lord, thy righteousness and thy goodness shall be declared, if thou be merciful unto them which have not the confidence of good works.",
        "8:37": "Then answered he me, and said, Some things hast thou spoken aright, and according unto thy words it shall be.",
        "8:38": "For indeed I will not think on the disposition of them which have sinned before death, before judgment, before destruction:",
        "8:39": "But I will rejoice over the disposition of the righteous, and I will remember also their pilgrimage, and the salvation, and the reward, that they shall have.",
        "8:40": "Like as I have spoken now, so shall it come to pass.",
        "8:41": "For as the husbandman soweth much seed upon the ground, and planteth many trees, and yet the thing that is sown good in his season cometh not up, neither doth all that is planted take root: even so is it of them that are sown in the world; they shall not all be saved.",
        "8:42": "I answered then and said, If I have found grace, let me speak.",
        "8:43": "Like as the husbandman’s seed perisheth, if it come not up, and receive not thy rain in due season; or if there come too much rain, and corrupt it:",
        "8:44": "Even so perisheth man also, which is formed with thy hands, and is called thine own image, because thou art like unto him, for whose sake thou hast made all things, and likened him unto the husbandman’s seed.",
        "8:45": "Be not wroth with us but spare thy people, and have mercy upon thine own inheritance: for thou art merciful unto thy creature.",
        "8:46": "Then answered he me, and said, Things present are for the present, and things to cometh for such as be to come.",
        "8:47": "For thou comest far short that thou shouldest be able to love my creature more than I: but I have ofttimes drawn nigh unto thee, and unto it, but never to the unrighteous.",
        "8:48": "In this also thou art marvellous before the most High:",
        "8:49": "In that thou hast humbled thyself, as it becometh thee, and hast not judged thyself worthy to be much glorified among the righteous.",
        "8:50": "For many great miseries shall be done to them that in the latter time shall dwell in the world, because they have walked in great pride.",
        "8:51": "But understand thou for thyself, and seek out the glory for such as be like thee.",
        "8:52": "For unto you is paradise opened, the tree of life is planted, the time to come is prepared, plenteousness is made ready, a city is builded, and rest is allowed, yea, perfect goodness and wisdom.",
        "8:53": "The root of evil is sealed up from you, weakness and the moth is hid from you, and corruption is fled into hell to be forgotten:",
        "8:54": "Sorrows are passed, and in the end is shewed the treasure of immortality.",
        "8:55": "And therefore ask thou no more questions concerning the multitude of them that perish.",
        "8:56": "For when they had taken liberty, they despised the most High, thought scorn of his law, and forsook his ways.",
        "8:57": "Moreover they have trodden down his righteous,",
        "8:58": "And said in their heart, that there is no God; yea, and that knowing they must die.",
        "8:59": "For as the things aforesaid shalt receive you, so thirst and pain are prepared for them: for it was not his will that men should come to nought:",
        "8:60": "But they which be created have defiled the name of him that made them, and were unthankful unto him which prepared life for them.",
        "8:61": "And therefore is my judgment now at hand.",
        "8:62": "These things have I not shewed unto all men, but unto thee, and a few like thee. Then answered I and said,",
        "8:63": "Behold, O Lord, now hast thou shewed me the multitude of the wonders, which thou wilt begin to do in the last times: but at what time, thou hast not shewed me.",
        "9:1": "He answered me then, and said, Measure thou the time diligently in itself: and when thou seest part of the signs past, which I have told thee before,",
        "9:2": "Then shalt thou understand, that it is the very same time, wherein the Highest will begin to visit the world which he made.",
        "9:3": "Therefore when there shall be seen earthquakes and uproars of the people in the world:",
        "9:4": "Then shalt thou well understand, that the most High spake of those things from the days that were before thee, even from the beginning.",
        "9:5": "For like as all that is made in the world hath a beginning and an end, and the end is manifest:",
        "9:6": "Even so the times also of the Highest have plain beginnings in wonder and powerful works, and endings in effects and signs.",
        "9:7": "And every one that shall be saved, and shall be able to escape by his works, and by faith, whereby ye have believed,",
        "9:8": "Shall be preserved from the said perils, and shall see my salvation in my land, and within my borders: for I have sanctified them for me from the beginning.",
        "9:9": "Then shall they be in pitiful case, which now have abused my ways: and they that have cast them away despitefully shall dwell in torments.",
        "9:10": "For such as in their life have received benefits, and have not known me;",
        "9:11": "And they that have loathed my law, while they had yet liberty, and, when as yet place of repentance was open unto them, understood not, but despised it;",
        "9:12": "The same must know it after death by pain.",
        "9:13": "And therefore be thou not curious how the ungodly shall be punished, and when: but enquire how the righteous shall be saved, whose the world is, and for whom the world is created.",
        "9:14": "Then answered I and said,",
        "9:15": "I have said before, and now do speak, and will speak it also hereafter, that there be many more of them which perish, than of them which shall be saved:",
        "9:16": "Like as a wave is greater than a drop.",
        "9:17": "And he answered me, saying, Like as the field is, so is also the seed; as the flowers be, such are the colours also; such as the workman is, such also is the work; and as the husbandman ls himself, so is his husbandry also: for it was the time of the world.",
        "9:18": "And now when I prepared the world, which was not yet made, even for them to dwell in that now live, no man spake against me.",
        "9:19": "For then every one obeyed: but now the manners of them which are created in this world that is made are corrupted by a perpetual seed, and by a law which is unsearchable rid themselves.",
        "9:20": "So I considered the world, and, behold, there was peril because of the devices that were come into it.",
        "9:21": "And I saw, and spared it greatly, and have kept me a grape of the cluster, and a plant of a great people.",
        "9:22": "Let the multitude perish then, which was born in vain; and let my grape be kept, and my plant; for with great labour have I made it perfect.",
        "9:23": "Nevertheless, if thou wilt cease yet seven days more, (but thou shalt not fast in them,",
        "9:24": "But go into a field of flowers, where no house is builded, and eat only the flowers of the field; taste no flesh, drink no wine, but eat flowers only;)",
        "9:25": "And pray unto the Highest continually, then will I come and talk with thee.",
        "9:26": "So I went my way into the field which is called Ardath, like as he commanded me; and there I sat among the flowers, and did eat of the herbs of the field, and the meat of the same satisfied me.",
        "9:27": "After seven days I sat upon the grass, and my heart was vexed within me, like as before:",
        "9:28": "And I opened my mouth, and began to talk before the most High, and said,",
        "9:29": "O Lord, thou that shewest thyself unto us, thou wast shewed unto our fathers in the wilderness, in a place where no man treadeth, in a barren place, when they came out of Egypt.",
        "9:30": "And thou spakest saying, Hear me, O Israel; and mark my words, thou seed of Jacob.",
        "9:31": "For, behold, I sow my law in you, and it shall bring fruit in you, and ye shall be honoured in it for ever.",
        "9:32": "But our fathers, which received the law, kept it not, and observed not thy ordinances: and though the fruit of thy law did not perish, neither could it, for it was thine;",
        "9:33": "Yet they that received it perished, because they kept not the thing that was sown in them.",
        "9:34": "And, lo, it ls a custom, when the ground hath received seed, or the sea a ship, or any vessel meat or drink, that, that being perished wherein it was sown or cast into,",
        "9:35": "That thing also which was sown, or cast therein, or received, doth perish, and remaineth not with us: but with us it hath not happened so.",
        "9:36": "For we that have received the law perish by sin, and our heart also which received it",
        "9:37": "Notwithstanding the law perisheth not, but remaineth in his force.",
        "9:38": "And when I spake these things in my heart, I looked back with mine eyes, and upon the right side I saw a woman, and, behold, she mourned and wept with a loud voice, and was much grieved in heart, and her clothes were rent, and she had ashes upon her head.",
        "9:39": "Then let I my thoughts go that I was in, and turned me unto her,",
        "9:40": "And said unto her, Wherefore weepest thou? why art thou so grieved in thy mind?",
        "9:41": "And she said unto me, Sir, let me alone, that I may bewail myself, and add unto my sorrow, for I am sore vexed in my mind, and brought very low.",
        "9:42": "And I said unto her, What aileth thee? tell me.",
        "9:43": "She said unto me, I thy servant have been barren, and had no child, though I had an husband thirty years,",
        "9:44": "And those thirty years I did nothing else day and night, and every hour, but make my, prayer to the Highest.",
        "9:45": "After thirty years God heard me thine handmaid, looked upon my misery, considered my trouble, and gave me a son: and I was very glad of him, so was my husband also, and all my neighbours: and we gave great honour unto the Almighty.",
        "9:46": "And I nourished him with great travail.",
        "9:47": "So when he grew up, and came to the time that he should have a wife, I made a feast.",
        "10:1": "And it so came to pass, that when my son was entered into his wedding chamber, he fell down, and died.",
        "10:2": "Then we all overthrew the lights, and all my neighbours rose up to comfort me: so I took my rest unto the second day at night.",
        "10:3": "And it came to pass, when they had all left off to comfort me, to the end I might be quiet; then rose I up by night and fled, and came hither into this field, as thou seest.",
        "10:4": "And I do now purpose not to return into the city, but here to stay, and neither to eat nor drink, but continually to mourn and to fast until I die.",
        "10:5": "Then left I the meditations wherein I was, and spake to her in anger, saying,",
        "10:6": "Thou foolish woman above all other, seest thou not our mourning, and what happeneth unto us?",
        "10:7": "How that Sion our mother is full of all heaviness, and much humbled, mourning very sore?",
        "10:8": "And now, seeing we all mourn and are sad, for we are all in heaviness, art thou grieved for one son?",
        "10:9": "For ask the earth, and she shall tell thee, that it is she which ought to mourn for the fall of so many that grow upon her.",
        "10:10": "For out of her came all at the first, and out of her shall all others come, and, behold, they walk almost all into destruction, and a multitude of them is utterly rooted out.",
        "10:11": "Who then should make more mourning than she, that hath lost so great a multitude; and not thou, which art sorry but for one?",
        "10:12": "But if thou sayest unto me, My lamentation is not like the earth’s, because I have lost the fruit of my womb, which I brought forth with pains, and bare with sorrows;",
        "10:13": "But the earth not so: for the multitude present in it according to the course of the earth is gone, as it came:",
        "10:14": "Then say I unto thee, Like as thou hast brought forth with labour; even so the earth also hath given her fruit, namely, man, ever since the beginning unto him that made her.",
        "10:15": "Now therefore keep thy sorrow to thyself, and bear with a good courage that which hath befallen thee.",
        "10:16": "For if thou shalt acknowledge the determination of God to be just, thou shalt both receive thy son in time, and shalt be commended among women.",
        "10:17": "Go thy way then into the city to thine husband.",
        "10:18": "And she said unto me, That will I not do: I will not go into the city, but here will I die.",
        "10:19": "So I proceeded to speak further unto her, and said,",
        "10:20": "Do not so, but be counselled. by me: for how many are the adversities of Sion? be comforted in regard of the sorrow of Jerusalem.",
        "10:21": "For thou seest that our sanctuary is laid waste, our altar broken down, our temple destroyed;",
        "10:22": "Our psaltery is laid on the ground, our song is put to silence, our rejoicing is at an end, the light of our candlestick is put out, the ark of our covenant is spoiled, our holy things are defiled, and the name that is called upon us is almost profaned: our children are put to shame, our priests are burnt, our Levites are gone into captivity, our virgins are defiled, and our wives ravished; our righteous men carried away, our little ones destroyed, our young men are brought in bondage, and our strong men are become weak;",
        "10:23": "And, which is the greatest of all, the seal of Sion hath now lost her honour; for she is delivered into the hands of them that hate us.",
        "10:24": "And therefore shake off thy great heaviness, and put away the multitude of sorrows, that the Mighty may be merciful unto thee again, and the Highest shall give thee rest and ease from thy labour.",
        "10:25": "And it came to pass while I was talking with her, behold, her face upon a sudden shined exceedingly, and her countenance glistered, so that I was afraid of her, and mused what it might be.",
        "10:26": "And, behold, suddenly she made a great cry very fearful: so that the earth shook at the noise of the woman.",
        "10:27": "And I looked, and, behold, the woman appeared unto me no more, but there was a city builded, and a large place shewed itself from the foundations: then was I afraid, and cried with a loud voice, and said,",
        "10:28": "Where is Uriel the angel, who came unto me at the first? for he hath caused me to fall into many trances, and mine end is turned into corruption, and my prayer to rebuke.",
        "10:29": "And as I was speaking these words behold, he came unto me, and looked upon me.",
        "10:30": "And, lo, I lay as one that had been dead, and mine understanding was taken from me: and he took me by the right hand, and comforted me, and set me upon my feet, and said unto me,",
        "10:31": "What aileth thee? and why art thou so disquieted? and why is thine understanding troubled, and the thoughts of thine heart?",
        "10:32": "And I said, Because thou hast forsaken me, and yet I did according to thy words, and I went into the field, and, lo, I have seen, and yet see, that I am not able to express.",
        "10:33": "And he said unto me, Stand up manfully, and I will advise thee.",
        "10:34": "Then said I, Speak on, my lord, in me; only forsake me not, lest I die frustrate of my hope.",
        "10:35": "For I have seen that I knew not, and hear that I do not know.",
        "10:36": "Or is my sense deceived, or my soul in a dream?",
        "10:37": "Now therefore I beseech thee that thou wilt shew thy servant of this vision.",
        "10:38": "He answered me then, and said, Hear me, and I shall inform thee, and tell thee wherefore thou art afraid: for the Highest will reveal many secret things unto thee.",
        "10:39": "He hath seen that thy way is right: for that thou sorrowest continually for thy people, and makest great lamentation for Sion.",
        "10:40": "This therefore is the meaning of the vision which thou lately sawest:",
        "10:41": "Thou sawest a woman mourning, and thou begannest to comfort her:",
        "10:42": "But now seest thou the likeness of the woman no more, but there appeared unto thee a city builded.",
        "10:43": "And whereas she told thee of the death of her son, this is the solution:",
        "10:44": "This woman, whom thou sawest is Sion: and whereas she said unto thee, even she whom thou seest as a city builded,",
        "10:45": "Whereas, I say, she said unto thee, that she hath been thirty years barren: those are the thirty years wherein there was no offering made in her.",
        "10:46": "But after thirty years Solomon builded the city and offered offerings: and then bare the barren a son.",
        "10:47": "And whereas she told thee that she nourished him with labour: that was the dwelling in Jerusalem.",
        "10:48": "But whereas she said unto thee, That my son coming into his marriage chamber happened to have a fail, and died: this was the destruction that came to Jerusalem.",
        "10:49": "And, behold, thou sawest her likeness, and because she mourned for her son, thou begannest to comfort her: and of these things which have chanced, these are to be opened unto thee.",
        "10:50": "For now the most High seeth that thou art grieved unfeignedly, and sufferest from thy whole heart for her, so hath he shewed thee the brightness of her glory, and the comeliness of her beauty:",
        "10:51": "And therefore I bade thee remain in the field where no house was builded:",
        "10:52": "For I knew that the Highest would shew this unto thee.",
        "10:53": "Therefore I commanded thee to go into the field, where no foundation of any building was.",
        "10:54": "For in the place wherein the Highest beginneth to shew his city, there can no man’s building be able to stand.",
        "10:55": "And therefore fear not, let not thine heart be affrighted, but go thy way in, and see the beauty and greatness of the building, as much as thine eyes be able to see:",
        "10:56": "And then shalt thou hear as much as thine ears may comprehend.",
        "10:57": "For thou art blessed above many other, and art called with the Highest; and so are but few.",
        "10:58": "But to morrow at night thou shalt remain here;",
        "10:59": "And so shall the Highest shew thee visions of the high things, which the most High will do unto them that dwell upon the earth in the last days. So I slept that night and another, like as he commanded me.",
        "11:1": "Then saw I a dream, and, behold, there came up from the sea an eagle, which had twelve feathered wings, and three heads.",
        "11:2": "And I saw, and, behold, she spread her wings over all the earth, and all the winds of the air blew on her, and were gathered together.",
        "11:3": "And I beheld, and out of her feathers there grew other contrary feathers; and they became little feathers and small.",
        "11:4": "But her heads were at rest: the head in the midst was greater than the other, yet rested it with the residue.",
        "11:5": "Moreover I beheld, and, lo, the eagle flew with her feathers, and reigned upon earth, and over them that dwelt therein.",
        "11:6": "And I saw that all things under heaven were subject unto her, and no man spake against her, no, not one creature upon earth.",
        "11:7": "And I beheld, and, lo, the eagle rose upon her talons, and spake to her feathers, saying,",
        "11:8": "Watch not all at once: sleep every one in his own place, and watch by course:",
        "11:9": "But let the heads be preserved for the last.",
        "11:10": "And I beheld, and, lo, the voice went not out of her heads, but from the midst of her body.",
        "11:11": "And I numbered her contrary feathers, and, behold, there were eight of them.",
        "11:12": "And I looked, and, behold, on the right side there arose one feather, and reigned over all the earth;",
        "11:13": "And so it was, that when it reigned, the end of it came, and the place thereof appeared no more: so the next following stood up. and reigned, and had a great time;",
        "11:14": "And it happened, that when it reigned, the end of it came also, like as the first, so that it appeared no more.",
        "11:15": "Then came there a voice unto it, and said,",
        "11:16": "Hear thou that hast borne rule over the earth so long: this I say unto thee, before thou beginnest to appear no more,",
        "11:17": "There shall none after thee attain unto thy time, neither unto the half thereof.",
        "11:18": "Then arose the third, and reigned as the other before, and appeared no more also.",
        "11:19": "So went it with all the residue one after another, as that every one reigned, and then appeared no more.",
        "11:20": "Then I beheld, and, lo, in process of time the feathers that followed stood up upon the right side, that they might rule also; and some of them ruled, but within a while they appeared no more:",
        "11:21": "For some of them were set up, but ruled not.",
        "11:22": "After this I looked, and, behold, the twelve feathers appeared no more, nor the two little feathers:",
        "11:23": "And there was no more upon the eagle’s body, but three heads that rested, and six little wings.",
        "11:24": "Then saw I also that two little feathers divided themselves from the six, and remained under the head that was upon the right side: for the four continued in their place.",
        "11:25": "And I beheld, and, lo, the feathers that were under the wing thought to set up themselves and to have the rule.",
        "11:26": "And I beheld, and, lo, there was one set up, but shortly it appeared no more.",
        "11:27": "And the second was sooner away than the first.",
        "11:28": "And I beheld, and, lo, the two that remained thought also in themselves to reign:",
        "11:29": "And when they so thought, behold, there awaked one of the heads that were at rest, namely, it that was in the midst; for that was greater than the two other heads.",
        "11:30": "And then I saw that the two other heads were joined with it.",
        "11:31": "And, behold, the head was turned with them that were with it, and did eat up the two feathers under the wing that would have reigned.",
        "11:32": "But this head put the whole earth in fear, and bare rule in it over all those that dwelt upon the earth with much oppression; and it had the governance of the world more than all the wings that had been.",
        "11:33": "And after this I beheld, and, lo, the head that was in the midst suddenly appeared no more, like as the wings.",
        "11:34": "But there remained the two heads, which also in like sort ruled upon the earth, and over those that dwelt therein.",
        "11:35": "And I beheld, and, lo, the head upon the right side devoured it that was upon the left side.",
        "11:36": "Then I head a voice, which said unto me, Look before thee, and consider the thing that thou seest.",
        "11:37": "And I beheld, and lo, as it were a roaring lion chased out of the wood: and I saw that he sent out a man’s voice unto the eagle, and said,",
        "11:38": "Hear thou, I will talk with thee, and the Highest shall say unto thee,",
        "11:39": "Art not thou it that remainest of the four beasts, whom I made to reign in my world, that the end of their times might come through them?",
        "11:40": "And the fourth came, and overcame all the beasts that were past, and had power over the world with great fearfulness, and over the whole compass of the earth with much wicked oppression; and so long time dwelt he upon the earth with deceit.",
        "11:41": "For the earth hast thou not judged with truth.",
        "11:42": "For thou hast afflicted the meek, thou hast hurt the peaceable, thou hast loved liars, and destroyed the dwellings of them that brought forth fruit, and hast cast down the walls of such as did thee no harm.",
        "11:43": "Therefore is thy wrongful dealing come up unto the Highest, and thy pride unto the Mighty.",
        "11:44": "The Highest also hath looked upon the proud times, and, behold, they are ended, and his abominations are fulfilled.",
        "11:45": "And therefore appear no more, thou eagle, nor thy horrible wings, nor thy wicked feathers nor thy malicious heads, nor thy hurtful claws, nor all thy vain body:",
        "11:46": "That all the earth may be refreshed, and may return, being delivered from thy violence, and that she may hope for the judgment and mercy of him that made her.",
        "12:1": "And it came to pass, whiles the lion spake these words unto the eagle, I saw,",
        "12:2": "And, behold, the head that remained and the four wings appeared no more, and the two went unto it and set themselves up to reign, and their kingdom was small, and fill of uproar.",
        "12:3": "And I saw, and, behold, they appeared no more, and the whole body of the eagle was burnt so that the earth was in great fear: then awaked I out of the trouble and trance of my mind, and from great fear, and said unto my spirit,",
        "12:4": "Lo, this hast thou done unto me, in that thou searchest out the ways of the Highest.",
        "12:5": "Lo, yet am I weary in my mind, and very weak in my spirit; and little strength is there in me, for the great fear wherewith I was afflicted this night.",
        "12:6": "Therefore will I now beseech the Highest, that he will comfort me unto the end.",
        "12:7": "And I said, Lord that bearest rule, if I have found grace before thy sight, and if I am justified with thee before many others, and if my prayer indeed be come up before thy face;",
        "12:8": "Comfort me then, and shew me thy servant the interpretation and plain difference of this fearful vision, that thou mayest perfectly comfort my soul.",
        "12:9": "For thou hast judged me worthy to shew me the last times.",
        "12:10": "And he said unto me, This is the interpretation of the vision:",
        "12:11": "The eagle, whom thou sawest come up from the sea, is the kingdom which was seen in the vision of thy brother Daniel.",
        "12:12": "But it was not expounded unto him, therefore now I declare it unto thee.",
        "12:13": "Behold, the days will come, that there shall rise up a kingdom upon earth, and it shall be feared above all the kingdoms that were before it.",
        "12:14": "In the same shall twelve kings reign, one after another:",
        "12:15": "Whereof the second shall begin to reign, and shall have more time than any of the twelve.",
        "12:16": "And this do the twelve wings signify, which thou sawest.",
        "12:17": "As for the voice which thou heardest speak, and that thou sawest not to go out from the heads but from the midst of the body thereof, this is the interpretation:",
        "12:18": "That after the time of that kingdom there shall arise great strivings, and it shall stand in peril of failing: nevertheless it shall not then fall, but shall be restored again to his beginning.",
        "12:19": "And whereas thou sawest the eight small under feathers sticking to her wings, this is the interpretation:",
        "12:20": "That in him there shall arise eight kings, whose times shall be but small, and their years swift.",
        "12:21": "And two of them shall perish, the middle time approaching: four shall be kept until their end begin to approach: but two shall be kept unto the end.",
        "12:22": "And whereas thou sawest three heads resting, this is the interpretation:",
        "12:23": "In his last days shall the most High raise up three kingdoms, and renew many things therein, and they shall have the dominion of the earth,",
        "12:24": "And of those that dwell therein, with much oppression, above all those that were before them: therefore are they called the heads of the eagle.",
        "12:25": "For these are they that shall accomplish his wickedness, and that shall finish his last end.",
        "12:26": "And whereas thou sawest that the great head appeared no more, it signifieth that one of them shall die upon his bed, and yet with pain.",
        "12:27": "For the two that remain shall be slain with the sword.",
        "12:28": "For the sword of the one shall devour the other: but at the last shall he fall through the sword himself.",
        "12:29": "And whereas thou sawest two feathers under the wings passing over the head that is on the right side;",
        "12:30": "It signifieth that these are they, whom the Highest hath kept unto their end: this is the small kingdom and full of trouble, as thou sawest.",
        "12:31": "And the lion, whom thou sawest rising up out of the wood, and roaring, and speaking to the eagle, and rebuking her for her unrighteousness with all the words which thou hast heard;",
        "12:32": "This is the anointed, which the Highest hath kept for them and for their wickedness unto the end: he shall reprove them, and shall upbraid them with their cruelty.",
        "12:33": "For he shall set them before him alive in judgment, and shall rebuke them, and correct them.",
        "12:34": "For the rest of my people shall he deliver with mercy, those that have been pressed upon my borders, and he shall make them joyful until the coming of the day of judgment, whereof I have spoken unto thee from the the beginning.",
        "12:35": "This is the dream that thou sawest, and these are the interpretations.",
        "12:36": "Thou only hast been meet to know this secret of the Highest.",
        "12:37": "Therefore write all these things that thou hast seen in a book, and hide them:",
        "12:38": "And teach them to the wise of the people, whose hearts thou knowest may comprehend and keep these secrets.",
        "12:39": "But wait thou here thyself yet seven days more, that it may be shewed thee, whatsoever it pleaseth the Highest to declare unto thee. And with that he went his way.",
        "12:40": "And it came to pass, when all the people saw that the seven days were past, and I not come again into the city, they gathered them all together, from the least unto the greatest, and came unto me, and said,",
        "12:41": "What have we offended thee? and what evil have we done against thee, that thou forsakest us, and sittest here in this place?",
        "12:42": "For of all the prophets thou only art left us, as a cluster of the vintage, and as a candle in a dark place, and as a haven or ship preserved from the tempest.",
        "12:43": "Are not the evils which are come to us sufficient?",
        "12:44": "If thou shalt forsake us, how much better had it been for us, if we also had been burned in the midst of Sion?",
        "12:45": "For we are not better than they that died there. And they wept with a loud voice. Then answered I them, and said,",
        "12:46": "Be of good comfort, O Israel; and be not heavy, thou house of Jacob:",
        "12:47": "For the Highest hath you in remembrance, and the Mighty hath not forgotten you in temptation.",
        "12:48": "As for me, I have not forsaken you, neither am I departed from you: but am come into this place, to pray for the desolation of Sion, and that I might seek mercy for the low estate of your sanctuary.",
        "12:49": "And now go your way home every man, and after these days will I come unto you.",
        "12:50": "So the people went their way into the city, like as I commanded them:",
        "12:51": "But I remained still in the field seven days, as the angel commanded me; and did eat only in those days of the flowers of the field, and had my meat of the herbs",
        "13:1": "And it came to pass after seven days, I dreamed a dream by night:",
        "13:2": "And, lo, there arose a wind from the sea, that it moved all the waves thereof.",
        "13:3": "And I beheld, and, lo, that man waxed strong with the thousands of heaven: and when he turned his countenance to look, all the things trembled that were seen under him.",
        "13:4": "And whensoever the voice went out of his mouth, all they burned that heard his voice, like as the earth faileth when it feeleth the fire.",
        "13:5": "And after this I beheld, and, lo, there was gathered together a multitude of men, out of number, from the four winds of the heaven, to subdue the man that came out of the sea",
        "13:6": "But I beheld, and, lo, he had graved himself a great mountain, and flew up upon it.",
        "13:7": "But I would have seen the region or place whereout the hill was graven, and I could not.",
        "13:8": "And after this I beheld, and, lo, all they which were gathered together to subdue him were sore afraid, and yet durst fight.",
        "13:9": "And, lo, as he saw the violence of the multitude that came, he neither lifted up his hand, nor held sword, nor any instrument of war:",
        "13:10": "But only I saw that he sent out of his mouth as it had been a blast of fire, and out of his lips a flaming breath, and out of his tongue he cast out sparks and tempests.",
        "13:11": "And they were all mixed together; the blast of fire, the flaming breath, and the great tempest; and fell with violence upon the multitude which was prepared to fight, and burned them up every one, so that upon a sudden of an innumerable multitude nothing was to be perceived, but only dust and smell of smoke: when I saw this I was afraid.",
        "13:12": "Afterward saw I the same man come down from the mountain, and call unto him another peaceable Multitude.",
        "13:13": "And there came much people unto him, whereof some were glad, some were sorry, and some of them were bound, and other some brought of them that were offered: then was I sick through great fear, and I awaked, and said,",
        "13:14": "Thou hast shewed thy servant these wonders from the beginning, and hast counted me worthy that thou shouldest receive my prayer:",
        "13:15": "Shew me now yet the interpretation of this dream.",
        "13:16": "For as I conceive in mine understanding, woe unto them that shall be left in those days and much more woe unto them that are not left behind!",
        "13:17": "For they that were not left were in heaviness.",
        "13:18": "Now understand I the things that are laid up in the latter days, which shall happen unto them, and to those that are left behind.",
        "13:19": "Therefore are they come into great perils and many necessities, like as these dreams declare.",
        "13:20": "Yet is it easier for him that is in danger to come into these things, than to pass away as a cloud out of the world, and not to see the things that happen in the last days. And he answered unto me, and said,",
        "13:21": "The interpretation of the vision shall I shew thee, and I will open unto thee the thing that thou hast required.",
        "13:22": "Whereas thou hast spoken of them that are left behind, this is the interpretation:",
        "13:23": "He that shall endure the peril in that time hath kept himself: they that be fallen into danger are such as have works, and faith toward the Almighty.",
        "13:24": "Know this therefore, that they which be left behind are more blessed than they that be dead.",
        "13:25": "This is the meaning of the vision: Whereas thou sawest a man coming up from the midst of the sea:",
        "13:26": "The same is he whom God the Highest hath kept a great season, which by his own self shall deliver his creature: and he shall order them that are left behind.",
        "13:27": "And whereas thou sawest, that out of his mouth there came as a blast of wind, and fire, and storm;",
        "13:28": "And that he held neither sword, nor any instrument of war, but that the rushing in of him destroyed the whole multitude that came to subdue him; this is the interpretation:",
        "13:29": "Behold, the days come, when the most High will begin to deliver them that are upon the earth.",
        "13:30": "And he shall come to the astonishment of them that dwell on the earth.",
        "13:31": "And one shall undertake to fight against another, one city against another, one place against another, one people against another, and one realm against another.",
        "13:32": "And the time shall be when these things shall come to pass, and the signs shall happen which I shewed thee before, and then shall my Son be declared, whom thou sawest as a man ascending.",
        "13:33": "And when all the people hear his voice, every man shall in their own land leave the battle they have one against another.",
        "13:34": "And an innumerable multitude shall be gathered together, as thou sawest them, willing to come, and to overcome him by fighting.",
        "13:35": "But he shall stand upon the top of the mount Sion.",
        "13:36": "And Sion shall come, and shall be shewed to all men, being prepared and builded, like as thou sawest the hill graven without hands.",
        "13:37": "And this my Son shall rebuke the wicked inventions of those nations, which for their wicked life are fallen into the tempest;",
        "13:38": "And shall lay before them their evil thoughts, and the torments wherewith they shall begin to be tormented, which are like unto a flame: and he shall destroy them without labour by the law which is like unto me.",
        "13:39": "And whereas thou sawest that he gathered another peaceable multitude unto him;",
        "13:40": "Those are the ten tribes, which were carried away prisoners out of their own land in the time of Osea the king, whom Salmanasar the king of Assyria led away captive, and he carried them over the waters, and so came they into another land.",
        "13:41": "But they took this counsel among themselves, that they would leave the multitude of the heathen, and go forth into a further country, where never mankind dwelt,",
        "13:42": "That they might there keep their statutes, which they never kept in their own land.",
        "13:43": "And they entered into Euphrates by the narrow places of the river.",
        "13:44": "For the most High then shewed signs for them, and held still the flood, till they were passed over.",
        "13:45": "For through that country there was a great way to go, namely, of a year and a half: and the same region is called Arsareth.",
        "13:46": "Then dwelt they there until the latter time; and now when they shall begin to come,",
        "13:47": "The Highest shall stay the springs of the stream again, that they may go through: therefore sawest thou the multitude with peace.",
        "13:48": "But those that be left behind of thy people are they that are found within my borders.",
        "13:49": "Now when he destroyeth the multitude of the nations that are gathered together, he shall defend his people that remain.",
        "13:50": "And then shall he shew them great wonders.",
        "13:51": "Then said I, O Lord that bearest rule, shew me this: Wherefore have I seen the man coming up from the midst of the sea?",
        "13:52": "And he said unto me, Like as thou canst neither seek out nor know the things that are in the deep of the sea: even so can no man upon earth see my Son, or those that be with him, but in the day time.",
        "13:53": "This is the interpretation of the dream which thou sawest, and whereby thou only art here lightened.",
        "13:54": "For thou hast forsaken thine own way, and applied thy diligence unto my law, and sought it.",
        "13:55": "Thy life hast thou ordered in wisdom, and hast called understanding thy mother.",
        "13:56": "And therefore have I shewed thee the treasures of the Highest: after other three days I will speak other things unto thee, and declare unto thee mighty and wondrous things.",
        "13:57": "Then went I forth into the field, giving praise and thanks greatly unto the most High because of his wonders which he did in time;",
        "13:58": "And because he governeth the same, and such things as fall in their seasons: and there I sat three days.",
        "14:1": "And it came to pass upon the third day, I sat under an oak, and, behold, there came a voice out of a bush over against me, and said, Esdras, Esdras.",
        "14:2": "And I said, Here am I, Lord And I stood up upon my feet.",
        "14:3": "Then said he unto me, In the bush I did manifestly reveal myself unto Moses, and talked with him, when my people served in Egypt:",
        "14:4": "And I sent him and led my people out of Egypt, and brought him up to the mount of where I held him by me a long season,",
        "14:5": "And told him many wondrous things, and shewed him the secrets of the times, and the end; and commanded him, saying,",
        "14:6": "These words shalt thou declare, and these shalt thou hide.",
        "14:7": "And now I say unto thee,",
        "14:8": "That thou lay up in thy heart the signs that I have shewed, and the dreams that thou hast seen, and the interpretations which thou hast heard:",
        "14:9": "For thou shalt be taken away from all, and from henceforth thou shalt remain with my Son, and with such as be like thee, until the times be ended.",
        "14:10": "For the world hath lost his youth, and the times begin to wax old.",
        "14:11": "For the world is divided into twelve parts, and the ten parts of it are gone already, and half of a tenth part:",
        "14:12": "And there remaineth that which is after the half of the tenth part.",
        "14:13": "Now therefore set thine house in order, and reprove thy people, comfort such of them as be in trouble, and now renounce corruption,",
        "14:14": "Let go from thee mortal thoughts, cast away the burdens of man, put off now the weak nature,",
        "14:15": "And set aside the thoughts that are most heavy unto thee, and haste thee to flee from these times.",
        "14:16": "For yet greater evils than those which thou hast seen happen shall be done hereafter.",
        "14:17": "For look how much the world shall be weaker through age, so much the more shall evils increase upon them that dwell therein.",
        "14:18": "For the time is fled far away, and leasing is hard at hand: for now hasteth the vision to come, which thou hast seen.",
        "14:19": "Then answered I before thee, and said,",
        "14:20": "Behold, Lord, I will go, as thou hast commanded me, and reprove the people which are present: but they that shall be born afterward, who shall admonish them? thus the world is set in darkness, and they that dwell therein are without light.",
        "14:21": "For thy law is burnt, therefore no man knoweth the things that are done of thee, or the work that shall begin.",
        "14:22": "But if I have found grace before thee, send the Holy Ghost into me, and I shall write all that hath been done in the world since the beginning, which were written in thy law, that men may find thy path, and that they which will live in the latter days may live.",
        "14:23": "And he answered me, saying, Go thy way, gather the people together, and say unto them, that they seek thee not for forty days.",
        "14:24": "But look thou prepare thee many box trees, and take with thee Sarea, Dabria, Selemia, Ecanus, and Asiel, these five which are ready to write swiftly;",
        "14:25": "And come hither, and I shall light a candle of understanding in thine heart, which shall not be put out, till the things be performed which thou shalt begin to write.",
        "14:26": "And when thou hast done, some things shalt thou publish, and some things shalt thou shew secretly to the wise: to morrow this hour shalt thou begin to write.",
        "14:27": "Then went I forth, as he commanded, and gathered all the people together, and said,",
        "14:28": "Hear these words, O Israel.",
        "14:29": "Our fathers at the beginning were strangers in Egypt, from whence they were delivered:",

        "16:71": "They shall be like mad men, sparing none, but still spoiling and destroying those that fear the Lord.",
        "16:72": "For they shall waste and take away their goods, and cast them out of their houses.",

        "5:6": "And they lifted up their voice, and they all wept.",
        "5:7": "And we sat there and fasted until the evening.",
        "6:1": "And it came to pass on the morrow that, lo! the army of the Chaldees surrounded the city, and at the time of the evening, I, Baruch, left the people, and I went forth and stood by the oak.",
        "6:2": "And I was grieving over Zion, and lamenting over the captivity which had come upon the people.",
        "6:3": "And lo! suddenly a strong spirit raised me, and bore me aloft over the wall of Jerusalem.",
        "6:4": "And I beheld, and lo! four angels standing at the four corners of the city, each of them holding a torch of fire in his hands.",
        "6:5": "And another angel began to descend from heaven, and said unto them: 'Hold your lamps, and do not light them till I tell you.",
        "6:6": "For I am first sent to speak a word to the earth, and to place in it what the Lord the Most High has commanded me",
        "6:7": "And I saw him descend into the Holy of holies, and take from thence the veil, and the holy ark, and the mercy-seat, and the two tables, and the holy raiment of the priests, and the altar of incense, and the forty-eight precious stones, wherewith the priest was adorned and all the holy vessels of the tabernacle.",
        "6:8": "And he spake to the earth with a loud voice: 'Earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the mighty God, And receive what I commit to thee, And guard them until the last times, So that, when thou art ordered, thou mayst restore them, So that strangers may not get possession of them.",
        "6:9": "For the time comes when Jerusalem also will be delivered for a time, Until it is said, that it is again restored for ever.'",
        "6:10": "And the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up.",
        "7:1": "And after these things I heard that angel saying unto those angels who held the lamps:",
        "7:2": "Destroy, therefore, and overthrow its wall to its foundations, lest the enemy should boast and say: \"We have overthrown the wall of Zion, And we have burnt the place of the mighty God.\" And ye have seized the place where I had been standing before.",
        "8:1": "Now the angels did as he had commanded them, and when they had broken up the corners of the walls, a voice was heard from the interior of the temple, after the wall had fallen, saying:",
        "8:2": "'Enter, ye enemies, And come, ye adversaries; For he who kept the house has forsaken (it).'",
        "8:3": "And I, Baruch, departed.",
        "8:4": "And it came to pass after these things that the army of the Chaldees entered and seized the house,",
        "8:5": "and all that was around it. And they led the people away captive, and slew some of them, and bound Zedekiah the king, and sent him to the king of Babylon.",
        "9:1": "And I, Baruch, came, and Jeremiah, whose heart was found pure from sins, who had not been captured in the seizure of the city.",
        "9:2": "And we rent our garments, we wept, and mourned, and fasted seven days.",
        "10:1": "And it came to pass after seven days, that the word of God came to me, and said unto me:",
        "10:2": "'Tell Jeremiah to go and support the captivity of the people unto Babylon,",
        "10:3": "But do thou remain here amid the desolation of Zion, and I will show to thee after these days' what will befall at the end of days.'",
        "10:5": "And I said to Jeremiah as the Lord commanded me. And he, indeed, departed with the people, but I, Baruch, returned and sat before the gates of the temple, and I lamented with the following lamentation over Zion and said:",
        "10:6": "'Blessed is he who was not born, Or he, who having been born, has died.",
        "10:7": "But as for us who live, woe unto us, Because we see the afflictions of Zion, And what has befallen Jerusalem.",
        "10:8": "I will call the Sirens from the sea, And ye Lilin, come ye from the desert, And ye Shedim and dragons from the forests: Awake and gird up your loins unto mourning, And take up with me the dirges, And make lamentation with me.",
        "10:9": "Ye husbandmen, sow not again; And, O earth, wherefore givest thou thy harvest fruits? Keep within thee the sweets of thy sustenance.",
        "10:10": "And thou, vine, why further dost thou give thy wine; For an offering will not again be made therefrom in Zion. Nor will the first-fruits again be offered.",
        "10:11": "And do ye, O heavens, withhold your dew, And open not the treasuries of rain:",
        "10:12": "And do thou, O sun, withhold the light of thy rays. And do thou, O moon, extinguish the multitude of thy light; For why should light rise again Where the light of Zion is darkened?",
        "10:13": "And you, ye bridegrooms, enter not in, And let not the brides adorn themselves with garlands",
        "10:14": "And, ye women, pray not that ye may bear. For the barren shall above all rejoice, And those who have no sons shall be glad, And those who have sons shall have anguish.",
        "10:15": "For why should they bear in pain, Only to bury in grief?",
        "10:16": "Or why, again, should mankind have sons? Or why should the seed of their kind again be named, Where this mother is desolate, And her sons are led into captivity?",
        "10:17": "From this time forward speak not of beauty, And discourse not of gracefulness.",
        "10:18": "Moreover, ye priests, take ye the keys of the sanctuary And cast them into the height of heaven, And give them to the Lord and say: \"Guard Thy house Thyself. For lo! we are found false stewards.\"",
        "10:19": "And you, ye virgins; who weave fine linen And silk with gold of Ophir, Take with haste all (these) things And cast (them) into the fire, That it may bear them to Him who made them, And the flame send them to Him who created them, Lest the enemy get possession of them.'",
        "11:1": "Moreover, I, Baruch, say this against thee, Babylon: If thou hadst prospered, And Zion had dwelt in her glory, Yet the grief to us had been great That thou shouldst be equal to Zion.",
        "11:2": "But now, lo! the grief is infinite, And the lamentation measureless, For lo! thou art prospered And Zion desolate.",
        "11:3": "Who will be judge regarding these things? Or to whom shall we complain regarding that which has befallen us?",
        "11:4": "O Lord, how hast Thou borne (it)? Our fathers went to rest without grief And lo! the righteous sleep in the earth in tranquillity;",
        "11:5": "For they knew not this anguish, Nor yet had they heard of that which had befallen us.",
        "11:6": "Would that thou hadst ears, O earth, And that thou hadst a heart, O dust. That ye might go and announce in Sheol, And say to the dead:",
        "11:7": "\"Blessed are ye more than we who live.\"",
        "12:1": "But I will say this as I think. And I will speak against thee, O land, which art prospering.",
        "12:2": "The noonday does not always burn. Nor do the rays of the sun constantly give light.",
        "12:3": "Do not expect [and hope] that thou wilt always be prosperous and rejoicing. And be not greatly up-lifted and boastful.",
        "12:4": "For assuredly in its own season shall the (divine) wrath awake against thee. Which now in long-suffering is held in as it were by reins.",
        "12:5": "And when I had said these things, I fasted seven days.",
        "13:1": "And it came to pass after these things, that I, Baruch, was standing upon Mount Zion, and lo! a voice came from the height and said unto me:",
        "13:2": "'Stand upon thy feet, Baruch, and hear the word of the mighty God.'",
        "13:3": "Because thou hast been astonied at what has befallen Zion, thou shalt therefore be assuredly preserved to the consummation of the times, that thou mayst be for a testimony.",
        "13:4": "So that, if ever those prosperous cities say: 'Why hath the mighty God brought upon us this retribution?'",
        "13:5": "Say thou, to them, thou and those like thee who shall have seen this evil: '(This is the evil) and retribution which is coming upon you and upon your people in its (destined) time that the nations may be thoroughly smitten.",
        "13:6": "And then they shall be in anguish.",
        "13:7": "And if they say at that time: For how long? Thou wilt say to them:",
        "13:8": "Ye who have drunk the strained wine, Drink ye also of its dregs, The judgement of the Lofty One Who has no respect of persons.\"",
        "13:9": "On this account he had aforetime no mercy on His own sons, But afflicted them as His enemies, because they sinned,",
        "13:10": "Then therefore were they chastened That they might be sanctified.",
        "13:11": "But now, ye peoples and nations, ye are guilty Because ye have always trodden down the earth, And used the creation unrighteously.",
        "13:12": "For I have always benefitted you. And ye have always been ungrateful for the beneficence",
        "14:1": "And I answered and said: 'Lo! Thou hast shown me the method of the times, and that which shall be alter these things",
        "14:2": "And Thou hast said unto me, that the retribution, which has been spoken of by Thee, shall come upon the nations. And now I know that those who have sinned are many, and they have lived in prosperity, and departed from the world, but that few nations will be left in those times, to whom those words shall be said which Thou didst say.",
        "14:3": "For what advantage is there in this, or what (evil), worse than what we have seen befall us, are we to expect to see?",
        "14:4": "But again I will speak in Thy presence:",
        "14:5": "What have they profited who had knowledge before Thee, and have not walked in vanity as the rest of the nations, and have not said to the dead: \"Give us life,\" but always feared Thee, and have not left Thy ways?",
        "14:6": "And lo! they have been carried off, nor on their account hast Thou had mercy on Zion.",
        "14:7": "And if others did evil, it was due to Zion, that on account of the works of those who wrought good works she should be forgiven, and should not be overwhelmed on account of the works of those who wrought unrighteousness.",
        "14:8": "But who, O Lord, my Lord, will comprehend Thy judgement, Or who will search out the profoundness of Thy way? Or who will think out the weight of Thy path?",
        "14:9": "Or who will be able to think out Thy incomprehensible counsel? Or who of those that are born has ever found The beginning or end of Thy wisdom?",
        "14:10": "For we have all been made like a breath.",
        "14:11": "For as the breath ascends involuntarily, and again dies, so it is with the nature of men, who depart not according to their own will, and know not what will befall them in the end.",
        "14:12": "For the righteous justly hope for the end, and without fear depart from this habitation, because they have with Thee a store of works preserved in treasuries.",
        "14:13": "On this account also these without fear leave this world, and trusting with joy they hope to receive the world which Thou hast promised them.",
        "14:14": "But as for us -- woe to us, who also are now shamefully entreated, and at that time look forward (only) to evils.",
        "14:15": "But Thou knowest accurately what Thou hast done by means of Thy servants; for we are not able to understand that which is good as Thou art, our Creator.",
        "14:16": "But again I will speak in Thy presence, O LORD, my Lord.",
        "14:17": "When of old there was no world with its inhabitants, Thou didst devise and speak with a word, and forthwith the works of creation stood before Thee.",
        "14:18": "And Thou didst say that Thou wouldst make for Thy world man as the administrator of Thy works, that it might be known that he was by no means made on account of the world, but the world on account of him.",
        "14:19": "And now I see that as for the world which was made on account of us, lo! it abides, but we, on account of whom it was made, depart.'",
        "15:1": "And the Lord answered and said unto me: 'Thou art rightly astonied regarding the departure of man, but thou hast not judged well regarding the evils which befall those who sin.",
        "15:2": "And as regards what thou hast said, that the righteous are carried off and the impious are prospered,",
        "15:3": "And as regards what thou hast said \"Man knows not Thy judgement\"",
        "15:4": "-- On this account hear, and I will speak to thee, and hearken, and I will cause thee to hear My words.",
        "15:5": "Man would not rightly have understood My judgement, unless he had accepted the law, and I had instructed him in understanding.",
        "15:6": "But now, because he transgressed wittingly, yea, just on this ground that he wot (thereof), he shall be tormented.",
        "15:7": "And as regards what thou didst say touching the righteous, that on account of them has this world come, so also again shall that, which is to come, come on their account.",
        "15:8": "For this world is to them a strife and a labour with much trouble; and that accordingly which is to come, a crown with great glory.'",
        "16:1": "And I answered and said: 'O LORD, my Lord, lo! the years of this time are few and evil, and who is able in his little time to acquire that which is measureless?'",
        "17:1": "And the Lord answered and said unto me: 'With the Most High account is not taken of much time nor of a few years.",
        "17:2": "For what did it profit Adam that he lived nine hundred and thirty years, and transgressed that which he was commanded?",
        "17:3": "Therefore the multitude of time that he lived did not profit him, but brought death and cut off the years of those who were born from him.",
        "17:4": "Or wherein did Moses suffer loss in that he lived only one hundred and twenty years, and, inasmuch as he was subject to Him who formed him, brought the law to the seed of Jacob, and lighted a lamp for the nation of Israel?'",
        "18:1": "And I answered and said: 'He that lighted has taken from the light, and there are but few that have imitated him.",
        "18:2": "But those many whom he has lighted have taken from the darkness of Adam and have not rejoiced in the light of the lamp.'",
        "19:1": "And He answered and said unto me: 'Wherefore at that time he appointed for them a covenant and said: \"Behold I have placed before you life and death,\" And he called heaven and earth to witness against them.",
        "19:2": "For he knew that his time was but short, But that heaven and earth endure always.",
        "19:3": "But after his death they sinned and transgressed, Though they knew that they had the law reproving (them), And the light in which nothing could err, Also the spheres which testify, and Me.",
        "19:4": "Now regarding everything that is, it is I that judge, but do not thou take counsel in thy soul regarding these things, nor afflict thyself because of those which have been.",
        "19:5": "For now it is the consummation of time that should be considered, whether of business, or of prosperity, or of shame, and not the beginning thereof.",
        "19:6": "Because if a man be prospered in his beginnings and shamefully entreated in his old age, he forgets all the prosperity that he had.",
        "19:7": "And again, if a man is shamefully entreated in his beginnings, and at his end is prospered, he remembereth not again his evil entreatment.",
        "19:8": "And again hearken: though each one were prospered all that time all the time from the day on which death was decreed against those who transgress, and in his end was destroyed, in vain would have been everything.'",
        "20:1": "Therefore, behold! the days come, And the times shall hasten more than the former, And the seasons shall speed on more than those that are past, And the years shall pass more quickly than the present (years).",
        "20:2": "Therefore have I now taken away Zion, That I may the more speedily visit the world in its season.",
        "20:3": "Now therefore hold fast in thy heart everything that I command thee, And seal it in the recesses of thy mind.",
        "20:4": "And then I will show thee the judgement of My might, And My ways which are unsearchable.",
        "20:5": "Go therefore and sanctify thyself seven days, and eat no bread, nor drink water, nor speak to anyone.",
        "20:6": "And afterwards come to that place and I will reveal Myself to thee, and speak true things with thee, and I will give thee commandment regarding the method of the times; for they are coming and tarry not.'",
        "21:1": "And I went thence and sat in the valley of Cedron in a cave of the earth, and I sanctified my soul there, and I eat no bread, yet I was not hungry, and I drank no water, yet I thirsted not, and I was there till the seventh day, as He had commanded me.",
        "21:2": "And afterwards I came to that place where He had spoken with me.",
        "21:3": "And it came to pass at sunset that my soul took much thought, and I began to speak in the presence of the Mighty One, and said:",
        "21:4": "'O Thou that hast made the earth, hear me, that hast fixed the firmament by the word, and hast made firm the height of the heaven by the spirit, that hast called from the beginning of the world that which did not yet exist, and they obey Thee.",
        "21:5": "Thou that hast commanded the air by Thy nod, and hast seen those things which are to be as those things which Thou art doing.",
        "21:6": "Thou that rulest with great thought the hosts that stand before Thee: also the countless holy beings, which Thou didst make from the beginning, of flame and fire, which stand around Thy throne Thou rulest with indignation.",
        "21:7": "To Thee only does this belong that Thou shouldst do forth with whatsoever Thou dost wish.",
        "21:8": "Who causest the drops of rain to rain by number upon the earth, and alone knowest the consummation of the times before they come; have respect unto my prayer.",
        "21:9": "For Thou alone art able to sustain all who are, and those who have passed away, and those who are to be, those who sin, and those who are righteous [as living (and) being past finding out].",
        "21:10": "For Thou alone dost live immortal and past finding out, and knowest the number of mankind.",
        "21:11": "And if in time many have sinned, yet others not a few have been righteous.",
        "21:12": "Thou knowest where Thou preservest the end of those who have sinned, or the consummation of those who have been righteous.",
        "21:13": "For if there were this life only, which belongs to all men, nothing could be more bitter than this,",
        "21:14": "For of what profit is strength that turns to sickness, Or fullness of food that turns to famine, Or beauty that turns to ugliness.",
        "21:15": "For the nature of man is always changeable.",
        "21:16": "For what we were formerly now we no longer are, and what we now are we shall not afterwards remain.",
        "21:17": "For if a consummation had not been prepared for all, in vain would have been their beginning.",
        "21:18": "But regarding everything that comes from Thee, do Thou inform me, and regarding everything about which I ask Thee, do Thou enlighten me.",
        "21:19": "How long will that which is corruptible remain, and how long will the time of mortals be prospered, and until what time will those who transgress in the world be polluted with much wickedness?",
        "21:20": "Command therefore in mercy and accomplish all that Thou saidst Thou wouldst bring, that Thy might may be made known to those who think that Thy long-suffering is weakness.",
        "21:21": "And show to those who know not, that everything that has befallen us and our city until now has been according to the long-suffering of Thy power, because on account of Thy name Thou hast called us a beloved people.",
        "21:22": "Bring to an end therefore henceforth mortality.",
        "21:23": "And reprove accordingly the angel of death, and let Thy glory appear, and let the might of Thy beauty be known, and let Sheol be sealed so that from this time forward it may not receive the dead, and let the treasuries of souls restore those which are enclosed in them.",
        "21:24": "For there have been many years like those that are desolate from the days of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and of all those who are like them, who sleep in the earth, on whose account Thou didst say that Thou hadst created the world.",
        "21:25": "And now quickly show Thy glory, and do not defer what has been promised by Thee.'",
        "21:26": "And (when) I had completed the words of this prayer I was greatly weakened.",
        "22:1": "And it came to pass after these things that lo! the heavens were opened, and I saw, and power was given to me, and a voice was heard from on high, and it said unto me:",
        "22:2": "'Baruch, Baruch, why art thou troubled?",
        "22:3": "He who travels by a road but does not complete it, or who departs by sea but does not arrive at the port, can he be comforted?",
        "22:4": "Or he who promises to give a present to another, but does not fulfill it, is it not robbery?",
        "22:5": "Or he who sows the earth, but does not reap its fruit in its season, does he not lose everything?",
        "22:6": "Or he who plants a plant unless it grows till the time suitable to it, does he who planted it expect to receive fruit from it?",
        "22:7": "Or a woman who has conceived, if she bring forth untimely, does she not assuredly slay her infant?",
        "22:8": "Or he who builds a house, if he does not roof it and complete it, can it be called a house? Tell Me that first.'",
        "23:1": "And I answered and said: 'Not so, O LORD, my Lord.'",
        "23:2": "And He answered and said unto me: Why therefore art thou troubled about that which thou knowest not, and why art thou ill at ease about things in which thou art ignorant?",
        "23:3": "For as thou hast not forgotten the people who now are and those who have passed away, so I remember those who are appointed to come.",
        "23:4": "Because when Adam sinned and death was decreed against those who should be born, then the multitude of those who should be born was numbered, and for that number a place was prepared where the living might dwell and the dead might be guarded.",
        "23:5": "Before therefore the number aforesaid is fulfilled, the creature will not live again [for My spirit is the creator of life], and Sheol will receive the dead.",
        "23:6": "And again it is given to thee to hear what things are to come after these times.",
        "23:7": "For truly My redemption has drawn nigh, and is not far distant as aforetime.",
        "24:1": "For behold! the days come and the books shall be opened in which are written the sins of all those who have sinned, and again also the treasuries in which the righteousness of all those who have been righteous in creation is gathered.",
        "24:2": "For it shall come to pass at that time that thou shalt see - and the many that are with thee -the long-suffering of the Most High, which has been throughout all generations, who has been long-suffering towards all who are born, (alike) those who sin and (those who) are righteous.'",
        "24:3": "And I answered and said: 'But, behold! O Lord, no one knows the number of those things which have passed nor yet of those things which are to come.",
        "24:4": "For I know indeed that which has befallen us, but what will happen to our enemies I know not, and when Thou wilt visit Thy works.'",
        "25:1": "And He answered and said unto me: 'Thou too shalt be preserved till that time till that sign which the Most High will work for the inhabitants of the earth in the end of days.",
        "25:2": "This therefore shall be the sign.",
        "25:3": "When a stupor shall seize the inhabitants of the earth, and they shall fall into many tribulations, and again when they shall fall into great torments.",
        "25:4": "And it will come to pass when they say in their thoughts by reason of their much tribulation: \"The Mighty One doth no longer remember the earth\" yea, it will come to pass when they abandon hope, that the time will then awake.'",
        "26:1": "And I answered and said: 'Will that tribulation which is to be continue a long time, and will that necessity embrace many years?'",
        "27:1": "And He answered and said unto me: 'Into twelve parts is that time divided, and each one of them is reserved for that which is appointed for it.",
        "27:2": "In the first part there shall be the beginning of commotions.",
        "27:3": "And in the second part (there shall be) slayings of the great ones.",
        "27:4": "And in the third part the fall of many by death.",
        "27:5": "And in the fourth part the sending of the sword.",
        "27:6": "And in the fifth part famine and the withholding of rain.",
        "27:7": "And in the sixth part earthquakes and terrors.",
        "27:8": "And in the eighth part a multitude of spectres and attacks of the Shedim.",
        "27:9": "And in the ninth part the fall of fire.",
        "27:10": "And in the tenth part rapine and much oppression,",
        "27:11": "And in the eleventh part wickedness and unchastity.",
        "27:12": "And in the twelfth part confusion from the mingling together of all those things aforesaid.",
        "27:13": "For these parts of that time are reserved, and shall be mingled one with another and minister one to another.",
        "27:14": "For some shall leave out some of their own, and receive (in its stead) from others, and some complete their own and that of others, so that those may not understand who are upon the earth in those days that this is the consummation of the times.",
        "28:1": "'Nevertheless, whosoever understandeth shall then be wise.",
        "28:2": "For the measure and reckoning of that time are two parts a week of seven weeks.'",

        "28:5": "Will he who is incorruptible despise those things which are corruptible, and whatever befalls in the case of those things which are corruptible, so that he might look only to those things which are not corruptible?]",
        "28:6": "But if, O Lord, those things shall assuredly come to pass which Thou hast foretold to me, so do Thou show this also unto me if indeed I have found grace in Thy sight.",
        "28:7": "Is it in one place or in one of the parts of the earth that those things are come to pass, or will the whole earth experience (them)?'",
        "29:1": "And He answered and said unto me: 'Whatever will then befall (will befall) the whole earth; therefore all who live will experience (them).",

        "29:4": "And Behemoth shall be revealed from his place and Leviathan shall ascend from the sea, those two great monsters which I created on the fifth day of creation, and shall have kept until that time; and then they shall be for food for all that are left.",
        "29:5": "The earth also shall yield its fruit ten thousandfold and on each (?) vine there shall be a thousand branches, and each branch shall produce a thousand clusters, and each cluster produce a thousand grapes, and each grape produce a cor of wine.",
        "29:6": "And those who have hungered shall rejoice: moreover, also, they shall behold marvels every day.",
        "29:7": "For winds shall go forth from before Me to bring every morning the fragrance of aromatic fruits, and at the close of the day clouds distilling the dew of health.",
        "29:8": "And it shall come to pass at that self-same time that the treasury of manna shall again descend from on high, and they will eat of it in those years, because these are they who have come to the consummation of time.",
        "30:1": "And it shall come to pass after these things, when the time of the advent of the Messiah is fulfilled, that He shall return in glory. Then all who have fallen asleep in hope of Him shall rise again.",
        "30:2": "And it shall come to pass at that time that the treasuries will be opened in which is preserved the number of the souls of the righteous, and they shall come forth, and a multitude of souls shall be seen together in one assemblage of one thought, and the first shall rejoice and the last shall not be grieved.",
        "30:3": "For they know that the time has come of which it is said, that it is the consummation of the times.",
        "30:4": "But the souls of the wicked, when they behold all these things, shall then waste away the more.",

        "31:3": "And I answered and said unto them: Hear, O Israel, and I will speak to thee, And give ear, O seed of Jacob, and I will instruct thee.",
        "31:4": "Forget not Zion, But hold in remembrance the anguish of Jerusalem.",
        "31:5": "For lo! the days come, When everything that is shall become the prey of corruption And be as though it had not been.",
        "32:1": "'But as for you, if ye prepare your hearts, so as to sow in them the fruits of the law, it shall protect you in that time in which the Mighty One is to shake the whole creation.",

        "32:4": "And afterwards it must be renewed in glory, and perfected for evermore.]",
        "32:5": "Therefore we should not be distressed so much over the evil which has now come as over that which is still to be.",
        "32:6": "For there will be a greater trial than these two tribulations when the Mighty One will renew His creation.",
        "32:7": "And now do not draw near to me for a few days, nor seek me till I come to you.'",
        "32:8": "And it came to pass when I had spoken to them all these words, that I, Baruch, went my way, and when the people saw me setting out, they lifted up their voice and lamented and said:",
        "32:9": "'Whither departest thou from us, Baruch, and forsakest us as a father who forsakes his orphan children, and departs from them?",

        "33:3": "And now if thou also forsakest us, it were good for us all to die before thee, and then that thou shouldst withdraw from us.'",
        "34:4": "And I answered and said unto the people: 'Far be it from me to forsake you or to withdraw from you, but I will only go unto the Holy of Holies to inquire of the Mighty One concerning you and concerning Zion, if in some respect I should receive more illumination: and after these things I will return to you.'",
        "35:1": "And I, Baruch, went to the holy place, and sat down upon the ruins and wept, and said:",
        "35:2": "'O that mine eyes were springs, And mine eyelids a fount of tears.",
        "35:3": "For how shall I lament for Zion, And how shall I mourn for Jerusalem?",
        "35:4": "Because in that place where I am now prostrate, Of old the high priest offered holy sacrifices, And placed thereon an incense of fragrant odours.",
        "35:5": "But now our glorying has been made into dust, And the desire of our soul into sand.'",
        "36:1": "And when I had said these things I fell asleep there, and I saw a vision in the night.",
        "36:2": "And lo! a forest of trees planted on the plain, and lofty and rugged rocky mountains surrounded it, and that forest occupied much space.",
        "36:3": "And lo! over against it arose a vine, and from under it there went forth a fountain peacefully.",
        "36:4": "Now that fountain came to the forest and was (stirred) into great waves, and those waves submerged that forest, and suddenly they rooted out the greater part of that forest, and overthrew all the mountains which were round about it.",
        "36:5": "And the height of the forest began to be made low, and the top of the mountains was made low and that fountain prevailed greatly, so that it left nothing of that great forest save one cedar only.",
        "36:6": "Also when it had cast it down and had destroyed and rooted out the greater part of that forest, so that nothing was left of it, nor could its place be recognized, then that vine began to come with the fountain in peace and great tranquillity, and it came to a place which was not far from that cedar, and they brought the cedar which had been cast down to it.",
        "36:7": "And I beheld and lo! that vine opened its mouth and spake and said to that cedar: 'Art thou not that cedar which was left of the forest of wickedness, and by whose means wickedness persisted, and was wrought all those years, and goodness never.",
        "36:8": "And thou didst keep conquering that which was not thine, and to that which was thine thou didst never show compassion, and thou didst keep extending thy power over those who were far from thee, and those who drew nigh thee thou didst hold fast in the toils of thy wickedness, and thou didst uplift thyself always as one that could not be rooted out!",
        "36:9": "But now thy time has sped and thine hour is come.",
        "36:10": "Do thou also therefore depart O cedar, after the forest. which departed before thee, and become dust with it. And let your ashes be mingled together,",
        "36:11": "And now recline in anguish and rest in torment till thy last time come, in which thou wilt come again, and be tormented still more.'",
        "37:12": "And after these things I saw that cedar burning, and the vine glowing, itself and all around it, the plain full of unfading flowers.",
        "37:13": "And I indeed awoke and arose.",
        "38:1": "And I prayed and said: 'O LORD, my Lord, Thou dost always enlighten those who are led by understanding.",
        "38:2": "Thy law is life, and Thy wisdom is right guidance.",
        "38:3": "Make known to me therefore the interpretation of this vision.",
        "38:4": "For Thou knowest that my soul hath always walked in Thy law, and from my (earliest) days I departed not from Thy wisdom.'",
        "39:1": "And He answered and said unto me: 'Baruch, this is the interpretation of the vision which thou hast seen.",
        "39:2": "As thou hast seen the great forest which lofty and rugged mountains surrounded, this is the word.",
        "39:3": "Behold! the days come, and this kingdom will be destroyed which once destroyed Zion, and it will be subjected to that which comes after it.",
        "39:4": "Moreover, that also again after a time will be destroyed, and another, a third, will arise, and that also will have dominion for its time, and will be destroyed.",
        "39:5": "And after these things a fourth kingdom will arise, whose power will be harsh and evil far beyond those which were before it, and it will rule many times as the forests on the plain, and it will hold fast for times, and will exalt itself more than the cedars of Lebanon.",
        "39:6": "And by it the truth will be hidden, and all those who are polluted with iniquity will flee to it, as evil beasts flee and creep into the forest.",
        "39:7": "And it will come to pass when the time of its consummation that it should fall has approached, then the principate of My Messiah will be revealed, which is like the fountain and the vine, and when it is revealed it will root out the multitude of its host.",
        "39:8": "And as touching that which thou hast seen, the lofty cedar, which was left of that forest, and the fact, that the vine spoke those words with it which thou didst hear, this is the word.",
        "40:1": "The last leader of that time will be left alive, when the multitude of his hosts will be put to the sword, and he will be bound, and they will take him up to Mount Zion, and My Messiah will convict him of all his impieties, and will gather and set before him all the works of his hosts.",
        "40:2": "And afterwards he will put him to death, and protect the rest of My people which shall be found in the place which I have chosen.",
        "40:3": "And his principate will stand for ever, until the world of corruption is at an end, and until the times aforesaid are fulfilled.",
        "40:4": "This is thy vision, and this is its interpretation.'",
        "41:1": "And I answered and said: 'For whom and for how many shall these things be? or who will be worthy to live at that time?",
        "41:2": "For I will speak before thee everything that I think, and I will ask of Thee regarding those things which I meditate.",
        "41:3": "For lo! I see many of Thy people who have withdrawn from Thy covenant, and cast from them the yoke of Thy law.",
        "41:4": "But others again I have seen who have forsaken their vanity, and fled for refuge beneath Thy wings.",
        "41:5": "What therefore will be to them? or how will the last time receive them?",
        "41:6": "Or perhaps the time of these will assuredly be weighed, and as the beam inclines will they be judged accordingly?'",
        "42:1": "And He answered and said unto me:",
        "42:2": "'These things also will I show unto thee. As for what thou didst say -- \"To whom will these things be, and how many (will they be)?\"- to those who have believed there shall be the good which was spoken of aforetime, and to those who despise there shall be the contrary of these things.",
        "42:3": "And as for what thou didst say regarding those who have drawn near and those who have withdrawn this is the word.",
        "42:4": "As for those who were before subject, and afterwards withdrew and mingled themselves with the seed of mingled peoples, the time of these was the former and was accounted as something exalted.",
        "42:5": "And as for those who before knew not but afterwards knew life, and mingled (only) with the seed of the people which had separated itself the time of these (is) the latter, and is accounted as something exalted.",
        "42:6": "And time shall succeed to time and season to season, and one shall receive from another, and then with a view to the consummation shall everything be compared according to the measure of the times and the hours of the seasons.",
        "42:7": "For corruption shall take those that belong to it, and life those that belong to it.",
        "42:8": "And the dust shall be called, and there shall be said to it: \"Give back that which is not thine, and raise up all that thou hast kept until its time.\"",

        "44:1": "And I, Baruch, went from thence, and came to my people, and I called my first-born son and [the Gedaliahs] my friends, and seven of the elders of the people, and I said unto them:",

        "51:5": "When therefore they see those, over whom they are now exalted, (but) who shall then be exalted and glorified more than they, they shall respectively be transformed, the latter into the splendour of angels, and the former shall yet more waste away in wonder at the visions and in the beholding of the forms.",
        "51:6": "For they shall first behold and afterwards depart to be tormented.",
        "51:7": "But those who have been saved by their works. And to whom the law has been now a hope, And understanding an expectation, And wisdom a confidence, Shall wonders appear in their time.",
        "51:8": "For they shall behold the world which is now invisible to them, And they shall behold the time which is now hidden from them:",
        "51:9": "And time shall no longer age them.",
        "51:10": "For in the heights of that world shall they dwell, And they shall be made like unto the angels, And be made equal to the stars, And they shall be changed into every form they desire, From beauty into loveliness, And from light into the splendour of glory.",
        "51:11": "For there shall be spread before them the extents of Paradise, and there shall be shown to them the beauty of the majesty of the living creatures which are beneath the throne, and all the armies of the angels, who [are now held fast by My word, lest they should appear, and] are held fast by a command, that they may stand in their places till their advent comes.",
        "51:12": "Moreover, there shall then be excellency in the righteous surpassing that in the angels.",
        "51:13": "For the first shall receive the last, those whom they were expecting, and the last those of whom they used to hear that they had passed away.",
        "51:14": "For they have been delivered from this world of tribulation, And laid down the burden of anguish.",
        "51:15": "For what then have men lost their life, And for what have those who were on the earth exchanged their soul?",
        "51:16": "For then they chose (not) for themselves this time, Which, beyond the reach of anguish, could not pass away: But they chose for themselves that time, Whose issues are full of lamentations and evils, And they denied the world which ages not those who come to it, And they rejected the time of glory, So that they shall not come to the honour of which I told thee before.'",
        "52:1": "And I answered and said: How can we forget those for whom woe is then reserved?",
        "52:2": "And why therefore do we again mourn for those who die? Or why do we weep for those who depart to Sheol?",
        "52:3": "Let lamentations be reserved for the beginning of that coming torment, And let tears be laid up for the advent of the destruction of that time.",
        "52:4": "[But even in the face of these things will I speaks",
        "52:5": "And as for the righteous, what will they do now?",
        "52:6": "Rejoice ye in the suffering which ye now suffer: For why do ye look for the decline of your enemies?",
        "52:7": "Make ready your soul for that which is reserved for you, And prepare your souls for the reward which is laid up for you.']",
        "53:1": "And when I had said these things I fell asleep there, and I saw a vision, and lo! a cloud was ascending from a very great sea, and I kept gazing upon it, and lo! it was full of waters white and black, and there were many colours in those self-same waters, and as it were the likeness of great lightning was seen at its summit.",
        "53:2": "And I saw the cloud passing swiftly in quick courses, and it covered all the earth.",
        "53:3": "And it came to pass after these things that cloud began to pour upon the earth the waters that were in it.",
        "53:4": "And I saw that there was not one and the same likeness in the waters which descended from it.",
        "53:5": "For in the first beginning they were black and many for a time, and afterwards I saw that the waters became bright, but they were not many, and after these things again I saw black (waters), and after these things again bright, and again black and again bright how this was done twelve times, but the black were always more numerous than the bright.",
        "53:6": "And it came to pass at the end of the cloud, that lo! it rained black waters, and they were darker than had been all those waters that were before, and fire was mingled with them, and where those waters descended, they wrought devastation and destruction.",
        "53:7": "And after these things I saw how that lightning which I had seen on the summit of the cloud, seized hold of it and hurled it to the earth.",
        "53:9": "Now that lightning shone exceedingly, so as to illuminate the whole earth, and it healed those regions where the last waters had descended and wrought devastation.",
        "53:10": "And it took hold of the whole earth, and had dominion over it.",
        "53:11": "And I saw after these things, and lo! twelve rivers were ascending from the sea, and they began to surround that lightning and to become subject to it.",
        "53:12": "And by reason of my fear I awoke.",
        "54:1": "And I besought the Mighty One, and said: Thou alone, O Lord, knowest of aforetime the deep things of the world, And the things which befall in their times Thou bringest about by Thy word, And against the works of the inhabitants of the earth Thou dost hasten the beginnings of the times, And the end of the seasons Thou alone knowest.",
        "54:2": "(Thou) for whom nothing is too hard, But who dost everything easily by a nod:",
        "54:3": "(Thou) to whom the depths come as the heights, And whose word the beginnings of the ages serve:",
        "54:4": "(Thou) who revealest to those who fear Thee what is prepared for them, That thenceforth they may be comforted.",
        "54:5": "Thou showest great acts to those who know not; Thou breakest up the enclosure of those who are ignorant, And lightest up what is dark, And revealest what is hidden to the pure, [Who in faith have submitted themselves to Thee and Thy law.]",
        "54:6": "Thou hast shown to Thy servant this vision; Reveal to me also its interpretation.",
        "54:7": "For I know that as regards those things wherein I besought Thee, I have received a response, And as regards what I besought, Thou didst reveal to me with what voice I should praise Thee, And from what members I should cause praises and hallelujahs to ascend to Thee.",
        "54:8": "For if my members were mouths, And the hairs of my head voices, Even so I could not give Thee the meed of praise, Nor laud thee as is befitting, Nor could I recount Thy praise, Nor tell the glory of Thy beauty.",
        "54:9": "For what am I amongst men, Or why am I reckoned amongst those who are more excellent than I, That I have heard all these marvelous things from the Most High, And numberless promises from Him who created me?",
        "54:10": "Blessed be my mother among those that bear, And praised among women be she that bare me.",
        "54:11": "For I will not be silent in praising the Mighty One, And with the voice of praise I will recount His marvellous deeds.",
        "54:12": "For who doeth like unto Thy marvellous deeds, O God, Or who comprehendeth Thy deep thought of life.",
        "54:13": "For with Thy counsel Thou dost govern all the creatures which Thy right hand has created, And Thou hast established every fountain of light beside Thee, And the treasures of wisdom beneath Thy throne hast Thou prepared.",
        "54:14": "And justly do they perish who have not loved Thy law, And the torment of judgement shall await those who have not submitted themselves to Thy power.",
        "54:15": "For though Adam first sinned And brought untimely death upon all, Yet of those who were born from him Each one of them has prepared for his own soul torment to come, And again each one of them has chosen for himself glories to come.",
        "54:16": "[For assuredly he who believeth will receive reward.",
        "54:17": "But now, as for you, ye wicked that now are, turn ye to destruction, because ye shall speedily be visited, in that formerly ye rejected the understanding of the Most High.",
        "54:18": "For His works have not taught you, Nor has the skill of His creation which is at all times persuaded you.]",
        "54:19": "Adam is therefore not the cause, save only of his own soul, But each of us has been the Adam of his own soul.",
        "54:20": "But do Thou, O Lord, expound to me regarding those things which Thou hast revealed to me, And inform me regarding that which I besought Thee.",
        "54:21": "For at the consummation of the world vengeance shall be taken upon those who have done wickedness according to their wickedness, And Thou wilt glorify the faithful according to their faithfulness.",
        "54:22": "For those who are amongst Thine own Thou rulest, And those who sin Thou blottest out from amongst Thine own.'",
        "55:1": "And it came to pass when I had finished speaking the words of this prayer, that I sat there under a tree, that I might rest in the shade of the branches.",
        "55:2": "And I wondered and was astonied, and pondered in my thoughts regarding the multitude of goodness which sinners who are upon the earth have rejected, and regarding the great torment which they have despised, though they knew that they should be tormented because of the sin they had committed.",
        "55:3": "And when I was pondering on these things and the like, lo! the angel Ramiel who presides over true visions was sent to me, and he said unto me:",
        "55:4": "'Why does thy heart trouble thee, Baruch, and why does thy thought disturb thee?",
        "55:5": "For if owing to the report which thou hast only heard of judgement thou art so moved, What (wilt thou be) when thou shalt see it manifestly with thine eyes?",
        "55:6": "And if with the expectation wherewith thou dost expect the day of the Mighty One thou art so overcome, What (wilt thou be) when thou shalt come to its advent?",
        "55:7": "And, if at the word of the announcement of the torment of those who have done foolishly thou art so wholly distraught, How much more when the event will reveal marvellous things?",
        "55:8": "And if thou hast heard tidings of the good and evil things which are then coming and art grieved, What (wilt thou be) when thou shalt behold what the majesty will reveal, Which shall convict these and cause those to rejoice.'",
        "56:1": "Nevertheless, because thou hast besought the Most High to reveal to thee the interpretation of the vision which thou hast seen,",
        "56:2": "I have been sent to tell thee. And the Mighty One hath assuredly made known to thee the methods of the times that have passed, and of those that are destined to pass in His world from the beginning of its creation even unto its consummation, of those things which (are) deceit and of those which (are) in truth.",
        "56:3": "For as thou didst see a great cloud which ascended from the sea, and went and covered the earth, this is the duration of the world which the Mighty One made when he took counsel to make the world.",
        "56:4": "And it came to pass when the word had gone forth from His presence, that the duration of the world had come into being in a small degree, and was established according to the multitude of the intelligence of Him who sent it.",
        "56:5": "And as thou didst previously see on the summit of the cloud black waters which descended previously on the earth, this is the transgression wherewith Adam the first man transgressed.",
        "56:6": "For [since] when he transgressed Untimely death came into being, Grief was named And anguish was prepared, And pain was created, And trouble consummated, And disease began to be established, And Sheol kept demanding that it should be renewed in blood, And the begetting of children was brought about, And the passion of parents produced, And the greatness of humanity was humiliated, And goodness languished.",
        "56:7": "What therefore can be blacker or darker than these things?",
        "56:8": "This is the beginning of the black waters which thou hast seen.",
        "56:9": "And from these black (waters) again were black derived, and the darkness of darkness was produced.",
        "56:10": "For he became a danger to his own soul: even to the angels became he a danger.",
        "56:11": "For, moreover, at that time when he was created, they enjoyed liberty.",
        "56:12": "And some of them descended, and mingled with the women.",
        "56:13": "And then those who did so were tormented in chains.",
        "56:14": "But the rest of the multitude of the angels, of which there is (no) number, restrained themselves.",
        "56:15": "And those who dwelt on the earth perished together (with them) through the waters of the deluge.",
        "56:16": "These are the black first waters.",
        "57:1": "And after these (waters) thou didst see bright waters: this is the fount of Abraham, also his generations and advent of his son, and of his son's son, and of those like them.",
        "57:2": "Because at that time the unwritten law was named amongst them, And the works of the commandments were then fulfilled, And belief in the coming judgement was then generated, And hope of the world that was to be renewed was then built up, And the promise of the life that should come hereafter was implanted.",
        "57:3": "These are the bright waters, which thou hast seen.",
        "58:1": "And the black third waters which thou hast seen, these are the mingling of all sins, which the nations afterwards wrought after the death of those righteous men, and the wickedness of the land of Egypt, wherein they did wickedly in the service wherewith they made their sons to serve.",
        "58:2": "Nevertheless, these also perished at last.",
        "59:1": "And the bright fourth waters which thou hast seen are the advent of Moses and Aaron and Miriam and Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb and of all those like them.",
        "59:2": "For at that time the lamp of the eternal law shone on all those who sat in darkness, which announced to them that believe the promise of their reward, and to them that deny, the torment of fire which is reserved for them.",
        "59:3": "But also the heavens at that time were shaken from their place, and those who were under the throne of the Mighty One were perturbed, when He was taking Moses unto Himself",
        "59:4": "For He showed him many admonitions together with the principles of the law and the consummation of the times, as also to thee, and likewise the pattern of Zion and its measures, in the pattern of which the sanctuary of the present time was to be made.",
        "59:5": "But then also He showed to him the measures of the fire, also the depths of the abyss, and the weight of the winds, and the number of the drops of rain:",
        "59:6": "And the suppression of anger, and the multitude of long-suffering, and the truth of judgement:",
        "59:7": "And the root of wisdom, and the riches of understanding, and the fount of knowledge:",
        "59:8": "And the height of the air, and the greatness of Paradise, and the consummation of the ages, and the beginning of the day of judgement:",
        "59:9": "And the number of the offerings, and the earths which have not yet come:",
        "59:10": "And the mouth of Gehenna, and the station of vengeance, and the place of faith, and the region of hope:",
        "59:11": "And the likeness of future torment, and the multitude of innumerable angels, and the flaming hosts, and the splendour of the lightning and the voice of the thunders, and the orders of the chiefs of the angels, and the treasuries of light, and the changes of the times, and the investigations of the law.",
        "59:12": "These are the bright fourth waters which thou hast seen.",
        "60:1": "'And the black fifth waters which thou hast seen raining are the works which the Amorites wrought, and the spells of their incantations which they wrought, and the wickedness of their mysteries, and the mingling of their pollution.",
        "60:2": "But even Israel was then polluted by sins in the days of the judges, though they saw many sip which were from Him who made them.",
        "61:1": "'And the bright sixth waters which thou didst see, this is the time in which David and Solomon were born.",
        "61:2": "And there was at that time the building of Zion, And the dedication of the sanctuary, And the shedding of much blood of the nations that sinned then, And many offerings which were offered then in the dedication of the sanctuary.",
        "61:3": "And peace and tranquillity existed at that time,",
        "61:4": "And wisdom was heard in the assembly: And the riches of understanding were magnified in the congregations,",
        "61:5": "And the holy festivals were fulfilled in blessedness and in much joy.",
        "61:6": "And the judgement of the rulers was then seen to be without guile, And the righteousness of the precepts of the Mighty One was accomplished with truth.",
        "61:7": "And the land [which] was then beloved by the Lord, And because its inhabitants sinned not, it was glorified beyond all lands, And the city Zion ruled then over all lands and regions.",
        "61:8": "These are the bright waters which thou hast seen.",
        "62:1": "'And the black seventh waters which thou bast seen, this is the perversion (brought about) by the counsel of Jeroboam, who took counsel to make two calves of gold:",
        "62:2": "And all the iniquities which kings who were after him iniquitously wrought.",
        "62:3": "And the curse of Jezebel and the worship of idols which Israel practised at that time.",
        "62:4": "And the withholding of rain, and the famines which occurred until women eat the fruit of their wombs.",
        "62:5": "And the time of their captivity which came upon the nine tribes and a half, because they were in many sins.",
        "62:6": "And Salmanasar king of Assyria came and led them away captive.",
        "62:7": "But regarding the Gentiles it were tedious to tell how they always wrought impiety and wickedness, and never wrought righteousness.",
        "62:8": "These are the black seventh waters which thou hast seen.",
        "63:1": "'And the bright eighth waters which thou hast seen, this is the rectitude and uprightness of Hezekiah king of Judah and the grace (of God) which came upon him.",
        "63:2": "For when Sennacherib was stirred up in order that he might perish, and his wrath troubled him in order that he might thereby perish, for the multitude also of the nations which were with him.",
        "63:3": "When, moreover, Hezekiah the king heard those things which the king of Assyria was devising, (i.e.) to come and seize him and destroy his people, the two and a half tribes which remained: nay, more he wished to overthrow Zion also: then Hezekiah trusted in his works, and had hope in his righteousness, and spake with the Mighty One and said:",
        "63:4": "\"Behold, for lo! Sennacherib is prepared to destroy us, and he will be boastful and uplifted when he has destroyed Zion.\"",
        "63:5": "And the Mighty One heard him, for Hezekiah was wise, And He had respect unto his prayer, because he was righteous.",
        "63:6": "And thereupon the Mighty One commanded Ramiel His angel who speaks with thee.",
        "63:7": "And I went forth and destroyed their multitude, the number of whose chiefs only was a hundred and eighty-five thousand, and each one of them had an equal number (at his command).",
        "63:8": "And at that time I burned their bodies within, but their raiment and arms I preserved outwardly, in order that the still more wonderful deeds of the Mighty One might appear, and that thereby His name might be spoken of throughout the whole earth.",
        "63:9": "And Zion was saved and Jerusalem delivered: Israel also was freed from tribulation.",
        "63:10": "And all those who were in the holy land rejoiced, and the name of the Mighty One was glorified so that it was spoken of.",

        "64:1": "'And the black ninth waters which thou hast seen, this is all the wickedness which was in the days of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah.",
        "64:2": "For he wrought much impiety, and he slew the righteous, and he wrested judgement. and he shed the blood of the innocent, and wedded women he violently polluted, and he overturned the altars, and destroyed their offerings, and drove forth their priests lest they should minister in the sanctuary.",
        "64:3": "And he made an image with five faces: four of them looked to the four winds, and the fifth on the summit of the image as an adversary of the zeal of the Mighty One.",
        "64:4": "And then wrath went forth from the presence of the Mighty One to the intent that Zion should be rooted out, as also it befell in your days.",
        "64:5": "But also against the two tribes and a half went forth a decree that they should also be led away captive, as thou hast now seen.",

        "64:7": "On this account Manasseh was at that time named \"the impious\", and finally his abode was in the fire.",
        "64:8": "For though his prayer was heard with the Most High, finally, when he was cast into the brazen horse and the brazen horse was melted, it served as a sign unto him for the hour.",
        "64:9": "For he had not lived perfectly, for he was not worthy but that thenceforward he might know by whom finally he should be tormented.",
        "64:10": "For he who is able to benefit is also able to torment.",
        "65:1": "Thus, moreover, did Manasseh act impiously, and thought that in his time the Mighty One would not inquire into these things.",

        "66:5": "And he was zealous with zeal for the Mighty One with all his soul, and he alone was firm in the law at that time, so that he left none that was uncircumcised, or that wrought impiety in all the land, all the days of his life.",
        "66:6": "Therefore he shall receive an eternal reward, and he shall be glorified with the Mighty One beyond many at a later time.",

        "78:4": "And truly I know that behold all we the twelve tribes are bound by one bond, inasmuch as we are born from one father.",
        "78:5": "Wherefore I have been the more careful to leave you the words of this epistle before I die, that ye may be comforted regarding the evils which have come upon you, and that ye may be grieved also regarding the evil that has befallen your brethren; and again, also, that ye may justify His judgement which He has decreed against you that ye should be carried away captives for what ye have suffered is disproportioned to what ye have done in order that, at the last times, ye may be found worthy of your fathers.",
        "78:6": "Therefore, if ye consider that ye have now suffered those things for your good, that ye may not finally be condemned and tormented, then ye will receive eternal hope; if above all ye destroy from your heart vain error, on account of which ye departed, hence.",
        "78:7": "For if ye so do these things, He will continually remember you, He who always promised on our behalf to those who were more excellent than we, that He will never forget or forsake us, but with much mercy will gather together again those who were dispersed.",
        "79:1": "Now, my brethren, learn first what befell Zion: how that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against us.",
        "79:2": "For we have sinned against Him who made us, and we have not kept the commandments which he commanded us,",
        "79:3": "yet he hath not chastened us as we deserved.",
        "79:4": "For what befell you we also suffer in a pre-eminent degree, for it befell us also.",
        "80:1": "And now, my brethren, I make known unto you that when the enemy had surrounded the city, the angels of the Most High were sent, and they overthrew the fortifications of the strong wall, and they destroyed the firm iron corners, which could not be rooted out.",
        "80:2": "Nevertheless, they hid all the vessels of the sanctuary, lest the enemy should get possession of them.",
        "80:3": "And when they had done these things, they delivered thereupon to the enemy the overthrown wall, and the plundered house, and the burnt temple, and the people who were overcome because they were delivered up, lest the enemy should boast and say: 'Thus by force have we been able to lay waste even the house of the Most High in war.",
        "80:4": "'Your brethren also have they bound and led away to Babylon, and have caused, them to dwell there.",
        "80:5": "But we have been left here, being very few.",
        "80:6": "This is the tribulation about which I wrote to you.",
        "80:7": "For assuredly I know that (the consolation of) the inhabitants of Zion consoleth you: so far as ye knew that it was prospered (your consolation) was greater than the tribulation which ye endured in having to depart from it.",
        "81:1": "But regarding consolation, hear ye the word.",
        "81:2": "For I was mourning regarding Zion, and I prayed for mercy from the Most High, and I said:",
        "81:3": "'How long will these things endure for us? And will these evils come upon us always?'",
        "81:4": "And the Mighty One did according to the multitude of His mercies, And the Most High according to the greatness of His compassion, And He revealed unto me the word, that I might receive consolation, And He showed me visions that I should not again endure anguish, And He made known to me the mystery of the times. And the advent of the hours he showed me.",
        "82:1": "Therefore, my brethren, I have written to you, that ye may comfort yourselves regarding the multitude of your tribulations.",
        "82:2": "For know ye that our Maker will assuredly avenge us on all our enemies, according to all that they have done to us, also that the consummation which the Most High will make is very nigh, and His mercy that is coming, and the consummation of His judgement is by no means far off.",
        "82:3": "For lo! we see now the multitude of the prosperity of the Gentiles, Though they act impiously, But they shall be like a vapour:",
        "82:4": "And we behold the multitude of their power, Though they do wickedly, But they shall be made like unto a drop:",
        "82:5": "And we see the firmness of their might. Though they resist the Mighty One every hour, But they shall be accounted as spittle.",
        "82:6": "And we consider the glory of their greatness, Though they do not keep the statutes of the Most High, But as smoke shall they pass away.",
        "82:7": "And we meditate on the beauty of theirs gracefulness, Though they have to do with pollutions, But as grass that withers shall they fade away.",
        "82:8": "And we consider the strength of their cruelty, Though they remember not the end (thereof), But as a wave that passes shall they be broken.",
        "82:9": "And we remark the boastfulness of their might, Though they deny the beneficence of God, who gave (it) to them, But they shall pass away as a passing cloud.",
        "83:1": "[For the Most High will assuredly hasten His times, And He will assuredly bring on His hours.",
        "83:2": "And He will assuredly judge those who are in His world, And will visit in truth all things by means of all their hidden works.",
        "83:3": "And He will assuredly examine the secret thoughts, And that which is laid up in the secret chambers of all the members of man. And will make (them) manifest in the presence of all with reproof.",
        "83:4": "Let none therefore of these present things ascend into your hearts, but above all let us be expectant, because that which is promised to us shall come.",
        "83:5": "And let us not now look unto the delights of the Gentiles in the present,",
        "83:6": "but let us remember what has been promised to us in the end. For the ends of the times and of the seasons and whatsoever is with them shall assuredly pass by together.",
        "83:7": "The consummation, moreover, of the age shall then show the great might of its ruler, when all things come to judgement.",
        "83:8": "Do ye therefore prepare your hearts for that which before ye believed, lest ye come to be in bondage in both worlds, so that ye be led away captive here and be tormented there.",
        "83:9": "For that which exists now or which has passed away, or which is to come, in all these things, neither is the evil fully evil, nor again the good fully good.",
        "83:10": "For all healthinesses of this time are turning into diseases,",
        "83:11": "And all might of this time is turning into weakness, And all the force of this time is turning into impotence, And every energy of youth is turning into old age and consummation.",
        "83:12": "And every beauty of gracefulness of this time is turning faded and hateful,",
        "83:13": "And every proud dominion of the present is turning into humiliation and shame, And every praise of the glory of this time is turning into the shame of silence,",
        "83:14": "And every vain splendour and insolence of this time is turning into voiceless ruin.",
        "83:15": "And every delight and joy of this time is turning to worms and corruption,",
        "83:16": "And every clamour of the pride of this time is turning into dust and stillness.",
        "83:17": "And every possession of riches of this time is being turned into Sheol alone,",
        "83:18": "And all the rapine of passion of this time is turning into involuntary death, And every passion of the lusts of this time is turning into a judgement of torment.",
        "83:19": "And every artifice and craftiness of this time is turning into a proof of the truth,",
        "83:20": "And every sweetness of unguents of this time is turning into judgement and condemnation,",
        "83:21": "And every love of lying is turning to contumely through truth.",
        "83:22": "Since therefore all these things are done now, does anyone think that they will not be avenged;",
        "83:23": "But the consummation of all things will come to the truth.]",
        "84:1": "Behold! I have therefore made known unto you (these things) whilst I live: for I have said (it) that ye should learn the things that are excellent; for the Mighty One hath commanded me to instruct you: and I will set before you some of the commandments of His judgement before I die.",
        "84:2": "Remember that formerly Moses assuredly called heaven and earth to witness against you and said:'If ye transgress the law ye shall be dispersed, but if ye keep it ye shall be kept.'",
        "84:3": "And other things also he used to say unto you when ye the twelve tribes were together in the desert.",
        "84:4": "And after his death ye cast them away from you: on this account there came upon you what had been predicted.",
        "84:5": "And now Moses used to tell you before they befell you, and lo! they have befallen you: for ye have forsaken the law.",
        "84:6": "Lo! I also say unto you after ye have suffered, that if ye obey those things which have been said unto you, ye will receive from the Mighty One whatever has been laid up and reserved for you.",
        "84:7": "Moreover, let this epistle be for a testimony between me and you, that ye may remember the commandments of the Mighty One, and that also there may be to me a defence in the presence of Him who sent me.",
        "84:8": "And remember ye the law and Zion, and the holy land and your brethren, and the covenant of your fathers, and forget not the festivals and the sabbaths.",
        "84:9": "And deliver ye this epistle and the traditions of the law to your sons after you, as also your fathers delivered (them) to you.",
        "84:10": "And at all times make request perseveringly and pray diligently with your whole heart that the Mighty One may be reconciled to you, and that He may not reckon the multitude of your sins, but remember the rectitude of your fathers.",
        "84:11": "For if He judge us not according to the multitude of His mercies, woe unto all us who are born.",
        "85:1": "[Know ye, moreover, that In former times and in the generations of old our fathers had helpers, Righteous men and holy prophets:",
        "85:2": "Nay more, we were in our own land [And they helped us when we sinned], And they interceded for us with Him who made us, [Because they trusted in their works], And the Mighty One heard their prayer and forgave us.",
        "85:3": "But now the righteous have been gathered And the prophets have fallen asleep, And we also have gone forth from the land, And Zion has been taken from us, And we have nothing now save the Mighty One and His law.",
        "85:4": "If therefore we direct and dispose our hearts, We shall receive everything that we lost, And much better things than we lost by many times.",
        "85:5": "For what we have lost was subject to corruption, And what we shall receive shall not be corruptible.",
        "85:6": "[Moreover, also, I have written thus to our brethren to Babylon, that to them also I may attest these very things.]",
        "85:7": "And let all those things aforesaid be always before your eyes, Because we are still in the spirit and the power of our liberty.",
        "85:8": "Again, moreover, the Most High also is long-suffering towards us here, And He hath shown to us that which is to be, And hath not concealed from us what will befall in the end.",
        "85:9": "Before therefore judgement exact its own, And truth that which is its due, Let us prepare our soul That we may possess, and not be taken possession of, And that we may hope and not be put to shame, And that we may rest with our fathers, and not be tormented with our enemies.",
        "85:10": "For the youth of the world is past, And the strength of the creation already exhausted, And the advent of the times is very short, Yea, they have passed by; And the pitcher is near to the cistern, And the ship to the port, And the course of the journey to the city, And life to (its) consummation.",
        "85:11": "And again prepare your souls, so that when ye sail and ascend from the ship ye may have rest and not be condemned when ye depart.",
        "85:12": "For lo! when the Most High will bring to pass all these things, There shall not there be again [a place of repentance, nor] a limit to the times, Nor a duration for the hours, Nor a change of ways, Nor place for prayer, Nor sending of petitions, Nor receiving of knowledge, Nor giving of love, Nor place of repentance for the soul, Nor supplication for offences, Nor intercession of the fathers, Nor prayer of the prophets, Nor help of the righteous.",
        "85:13": "There there is the sentence of corruption, The way of fire, And the path which bringeth to Gehenna.",

        "3:1": "And the angel of the Lord took me and led me to a second heaven.",
        "3:2": "And he showed me there also a door like the first and said, Let us enter through it.",
        "3:3": "And we entered, being borne on wings a distance of about sixty days' journey.",
        "3:4": "And he showed me there also a plain, and it was full of men, whose appearance was like that of dogs, and whose feet were like those of stags.",
        "3:5": "And I asked the angel: I pray thee, Lord, say to me who are these.",
        "3:6": "And he said, These are they who gave counsel to build the tower, for they whom thou seest drove forth multitudes of both men and women, to make bricks; among whom, a woman making bricks was not allowed to be released in the hour of child-birth, but brought forth while she was making bricks, and carried her child in her apron, and continued to make bricks. And the Lord appeared to them and confused their speech, when they had built the tower to the height of four hundred and sixty-three cubits.",
        "3:7": "And they took a gimlet, and sought to pierce the heaven, saying,",
        "3:8": "Let us see (whether) the heaven is made of clay, or of brass, or of iron. When God saw this He did not permit them, but smote them with blindness and confusion of speech, and rendered them as thou seest.",
        "4:1": "And I Baruch said, Behold, Lord, Thou didst show me great and wonderful things; and now show me all things for the sake of the Lord.",
        "4:2": "And the angel said to me, Come, let us proceed. (And I proceeded) with the angel from that place about one hundred and eighty-five days' journey.",
        "4:3": "And he showed me a plain and a serpent, which appeared to be two hundred plethra in length.",
        "4:4": "And he showed me Hades, and its appearance was dark and abominable.",
        "4:5": "And I said, Who is this dragon, and who is this monster around him?",
        "4:6": "And the angel said, The dragon is he who eats the bodies of those who spend their life wickedly, and he is nourished by them. And this is Hades, which itself also closely resembles him, in that it also drinks about a cubit from the sea, which does not sink at all.",
        "4:7": "Baruch said, And how (does this happen)? And the angel said, Hearken, the Lord God made three hundred and sixty rivers, of which the chief of all are Alphias, Abyrus, and the Gericus;\n[4:and] because of these the sea does not sink.",
        "4:8": "And I said, I pray thee show me which is the tree which led Adam astray.",
        "4:9": "And the angel said to me, It is the vine, which the angel Sammael planted, whereat the Lord God was angry, and He cursed him and his plant, while also on this account He did not permit Adam to touch it, and therefore the devil being envious deceived him through his vine.",
        "4:10": "[And I Baruch said, Since also the vine has been the cause of such great evil, and is under judgment of the curse of God, and was the destruction of the first created, how is it now so useful?",
        "4:11": "And the angel said, Thou askest aright. When God caused the deluge upon earth, and destroyed all flesh, and four hundred and nine thousand giants, and the water rose fifteen cubits above the highest mountains, then the water entered into paradise and destroyed every flower; but it removed wholly without the bounds the shoot of the vine and cast it outside. And when the earth appeared out of the water, and Noah came out of the ark, he began to plant of the plants which he found.",
        "4:12": "But he found also the shoot of the vine; and he took it, and was reasoning in himself, What then is it?",
        "4:13": "And I came and spake to him the things concerning it. And he said, Shall I plant it, or what shall I do? Since Adam was destroyed because of it, let me not also meet with the anger of God because of it.",
        "4:14": "And saying these things he prayed that God would reveal to him what he should do concerning it. And when he had completed the prayer which lasted forty days, and having besought many things and wept, he said:",
        "4:15": "Lord, I entreat thee to reveal to me what I shall do concerning this plant. But God sent his angel Sarasael, and said to him, Arise, Noah, and plant the shoot of the vine, for thus saith the Lord : Its bitterness shall be changed into sweetness, and its curse shall become a blessing, and that which is produced from it shall become the blood of God; and as through it the human race obtained condemnation, so again through Jesus Christ the Immanuel will they receive in Him the upward calling,\n[4:and] the entry into paradise].",
        "4:16": "Know therefore, O Baruch, that as Adam through this very tree obtained condemnation, and was divested of the glory of God, so also the men who now drink insatiably the wine which is begotten of it, transgress worse than Adam, and are far from the glory of God, and are surrendering themselves to the eternal fire.",
        "4:17": "For (no) good comes through it. For those who drink it to surfeit do these things: neither does a brother pity his brother, nor a father his son, nor children their parents, but from the drinking of wine come all evils, such as murders, adulteries, fornications, perjuries, thefts, and such like. And nothing good is established by it.",
        "5:1": "And I Baruch said to the angel, Let me ask thee one thing, Lord.",
        "5:2": "Since thou didst say to me that the dragon drinks one cubit out of the sea, say to me also, how great is his belly?",
        "5:3": "And the angel said, His belly is Hades; and as far as a plummet is thrown (by) three hundred men, so great is his belly. Come, then, that I may show thee also greater works than these.",
        "6:1": "And he took me and led me where the sun goes forth; and he showed me a chariot and four, under which burnt a fire, and in the chariot was sitting a man, wearing a crown of fire, (and) the chariot (was) drawn by forty angels.",
        "6:2": "And behold a bird circling before the sun, about nine cubits away.",
        "6:3": "And I said to the angel, What is this bird?",
        "6:4": "And he said to me, This is the guardian of the earth.",
        "6:5": "And I said, Lord, how is he the guardian of the earth? Teach me.",
        "6:6": "And the angel said to me, This bird flies alongside of the sun, and expanding his wings receives its fiery rays. For if he were not receiving them, the human race would not be preserved, nor any other living creature. But God appointed this bird thereto.",
        "6:7": "And he expanded his wings, and I saw on his right wing very large letters, as large as the space of a threshing-floor, the size of about four thousand modii;",
        "6:8": "and the letters were of gold. And the angel said to me, Read them.",
        "6:9": "And I read and they ran thus: Neither earth nor heaven bring me forth, but wings of fire bring me forth. And I said, Lord, what is this bird, and what is his name?",
        "6:11": "And the angel said to me, His name is called Phoenix. (And I said), And what does he eat? And he said to me, The manna of heaven and the dew of earth.",
        "6:12": "And I said, Does the bird excrete? And he said to me, He excretes a worm, and the excrement of the worm is cinnamon, which kings and princes use. But wait and thou shalt see the glory of God.",
        "6:13": "And while he was conversing with me, there was as a thunder-clap, and the place was shaken on which we were standing. And I asked the angel, My Lord, what is this sound?",
        "6:14": "And the angel said to me, Even now the angels are opening the three hundred and sixty-five gates of heaven, and the light is being separated from the darkness. And a voice came which said, Light giver, give to the world radiance.",
        "6:15": "And when I heard the noise of the bird, I said, Lord, what is this noise?",
        "6:16": "And he said, This is the bird who awakens from slumber the cocks upon earth. For as men do through the mouth, so also does the cock signify to those in the world, in his own speech. For the sun is made ready by the angels, and the cock crows.",
        "7:1": "And I said, And where does the sun begin its labors, after the cock crows?",
        "7:2": "And the angel said to me, Listen, Baruch: All things whatsoever I showed thee are in the first and second heaven, and in the third heaven the sun passes through and gives light to the world.",
        "7:3": "But wait, and thou shalt see the glory of God. And while I was conversing with him, I saw the bird, and he appeared in front, and grew less and less, and at length returned to his full size.",
        "7:4": "And behind him I saw the shining sun, and the angels which draw it, and a crown upon its bead, the sight of which we were not able to gaze Upon, and behold.",
        "7:5": "And as soon as the sun shone, the Phoenix also stretched out his wings.",
        "7:6": "But I, when I beheld such great glory, was brought low with great fear, and I fled and hid in the wings of the angel. And the angel said to me, Fear not, Baruch, but wait and thou shalt also see their setting.",
        "8:1": "And he took me and led me towards the west; and when the time of the, setting came,",
        "8:2": "I saw again the bird coming before it, and as soon as lie came I saw the angels, and they lifted the crown from its head.",
        "8:3": "But the bird stood exhausted and with wings contracted.",
        "8:4": "And beholding these things, I said, Lord, wherefore did they lift the crown from the head of the sun,and wherefore is the bird so exhausted?",
        "8:5": "And the angel said to me, The crown of the sun, when it has run through the day, four angels take it, and bear it up to heaven, and renew it, because it and its rays have been defiled upon earth; moreover it is so renewed each day.",
        "8:6": "And I Baruch said, Lord, and wherefore are its beams defiled upon earth? And the angel said to me, Because it beholds the lawlessness and unrighteousness of men, namely fornications, adulteries, thefts, extortions, idolatries, drunkenness, murders, strife, jealousies, evil-speakings, murmurings, whisperings, divinations, and such like, which are not well-pleasing to God. On account of these things is it defiled, and therefore is it renewed.",
        "8:7": "But thou askest concerning the bird, how it is exhausted. Because by restraining the rays of the sun through the fire and burning heat of the whole day, it is exhausted thereby. For, as we said before, unless his wings were screening the rays of the sun, no living creature would be preserved.",
        "9:1": "And they having retired, the night also fell, and at the same time came the chariot of the moon, along with the stars.",
        "9:2": "And I Baruch said, Lord, show me it also, I beseech of thee, how it goes forth, where it departs, and in what form it moves along. And the angel said, Wait' and thou shalt see it also shortly.",
        "9:3": "And on the morrow I also saw it in the form of a woman, and sitting on a wheeled chariot. And there were before it oxen and lambs in the chariot, and a multitude of angels in like manner.",
        "9:4": "And I said, Lord, what are the oxen and the lambs? And he said to me, They also are angels.",
        "9:5": "And again I asked, Why is it that it at one time increases, but at another time decreases?",
        "9:6": "And (he said to me), Listen, O Baruch: This which thou seest had been written by God beautiful as no other.",
        "9:7": "And at the transgression of the first Adam, it was near to Sammael when he took the serpent as a garment. And it did not hide itself but increased, and God was angry with it, and afflicted it, and shortened its days.",
        "9:8": "And I said, And how does it not also shine always, but only in the night?",
        "9:9": "And the angel said, Listen: as in the presence of a king, the courtiers cannot speak freely, so the moon and the stars cannot shine in the presence of the sun; for the stars are always suspended, but they are screened by the sun, and the moon, although it is uninjured, is consumed by the heat of the sun.",
        "10:1": "And when I had learnt all these things from the archangel, he took and led me into a fourth heaven.",
        "10:2": "And I saw a monotonous plain, and in the middle of it a pool of water.",
        "10:3": "And there were in it multitudes of birds of all kinds, but not like those here on earth.",
        "10:4": "But I saw a crane as great as great oxen; and all the birds were great beyond those in the world.",
        "10:5": "And I asked the angel, What is the plain, and what the pool, and what the multitudes of birds around it?",
        "10:6": "And the angel said, Listen, Baruch : The plain which contains in it the pool and other wonders is the place where the souls of the righteous come, when they hold converse, living together in choirs. But the water is that which the clouds receive, and rain upon the earth, and the fruits increase.",
        "10:7": "And I said again to the angel of the Lord, But (what) are these birds? And he said to me, They are those which continually sing praise to the Lord.",
        "10:8": "And I said, Lord, and how do men say that the water which descends in rain is from the sea?",
        "10:9": "And the angel said, The water which descends in rain -- this also is from the sea, and from the waters upon earth; but that which stimulates the fruits is (only) from the latter source.",
        "10:10": "Know therefore henceforth that from this source is what is called the dew of heaven.",
        "11:1": "And the angel took me and led me thence to a fifth heaven. And the gate was closed.",
        "11:2": "And I said, Lord, is not this gate-way open that we may enter? And the angel said to me, We cannot enter until Michael comes, who holds the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven; but wait and thou shalt see the glory of God.",
        "11:3": "And there was a great sound, as thunder. And I said, Lord, what is this sound?",
        "11:4": "And he said to me, Even now Michael, the commander of the angels, comes down to receive the prayers of men. And behold a voice came, Let the gates be opened.",
        "11:5": "And they opened them, and there was a roar as of thunder.",
        "11:6": "And Michael came, and the angel who was with me came face to face with him and said, Hail, my commander, and that of all our order.",
        "11:7": "And the commander Michael said, Hail thou also, our brother, and the interpreter of the revelations to those who pass through life virtuously.",
        "11:8": "And having saluted one another thus, they stood still. And I saw the commander Michael, holding an exceedingly great vessel; its depth was as great as the distance from heaven to earth, and its breadth as great as the distance from north to south. And I said, Lord, what is that which Michael the archangel is holding?",
        "11:9": "And he said to me, This is where the merits of the righteous enter, and such good works as they do, which are escorted before the heavenly God.",
        "12:1": "And as I was conversing with them, behold angels came bearing baskets full of flowers. And they gave them to Michael.",
        "12:2": "And I asked the angel, Lord, who are these, and what are the things brought hither from beside them?",
        "12:3": "And he said to me, These are angels (who) are over the righteous.",
        "12:4": "And the archangel took the baskets, and cast them into the vessel.",
        "12:5": "And the angel said to me, These flowers are the merits of the righteous.",
        "12:6": "And I saw other angels bearing baskets which were (neither) empty-nor full. And they began to lament, and did not venture to draw near, because they had not the prizes complete.",
        "12:7": "And Michael cried and said, Come hither, also, ye angels, bring what ye have brought.",
        "12:8": "And Michael was exceedingly grieved, and the angel who was with me, because they did not fill the vessel.",
        "13:1": "And then came in like manner other angels weeping and bewailing, and saying with fear, Behold how we are overclouded, O Lord, for we were delivered to evil men, and we wish to depart from them.",
        "13:2": "And Michael said, Ye cannot depart from them, in order that the enemy may not prevail to the end; but say to me what ye ask.",
        "13:3": "And they said, We pray thee, Michael our commander, transfer us from them, for we cannot abide with wicked and foolish men, for there is nothing good in them, but every kind of unrighteousness and greed.",
        "13:4": "For we do not behold them entering [into Church at all, nor among spiritual fathers, nor] into any good work. But where there is murder, there also are they in the midst, and where are fornications, adulteries, thefts, slanders, perjuries, jealousies, drunkenness, strife, envy, murmurings, whispering, idolatry, divination, and such like, then are they workers of such works, and of others worse.",
        "13:5": "Wherefore we entreat that we may depart from them. And Michael said to the angels, Wait till I learn from the Lord what shall come to pass.",
        "14:1": "And in that very hour Michael departed, and the doors were closed. And there was a sound as thunder.",
        "14:2": "And I asked the angel, What is the sound?",
        "14:3": "And he said to me, Michael is even now presenting the merits of men to God.",
        "15:1": "And in that very hour Michael descended, and the gate was opened; and he brought oil.",
        "15:2": "And as for the angels which brought the baskets which were full, he filled them with oil, saying, Take it away, reward our friends an hundredfold, and those who have laboriously wrought good works.",
        "15:3": "For those who sowed virtuously, also reap virtuously. And he said also to those bringing the half-empty baskets, Come hither ye also; take away the reward according as ye brought, and deliver it to the sons of men.",
        "15:4": "[Then he said also to those who brought the full and to those who brought the half-empty baskets: Go and bless our friends, and say to them that thus saith the Lord, Ye are faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things; enter into the joy of your Lord.]",
        "16:1": "And turning he said also to those who brought nothing:",
        "16:2": "Thus saith the Lord, Be not sad of countenance, and weep not, nor let the sons of men alone. But since they angered me in their works, go and make them envious and angry and provoked against a people that is no people, a people that has no understanding.",
        "16:3": "Further, besides these, send forth the caterpillar and the unwinged locust, and the mildew, and the common locust (and) hail with lightnings and anger, and punish them severely with the sword and with death, and their children with demons.",
        "16:4": "For they did not hearken to my voice, nor did they observe my commandments, nor do them, but were despisers of my commandments, and insolent towards the priests who proclaimed my words to them.",
        "17:1": "And while he yet spake, the door was closed, and we withdrew.",
        "17:2": "And the angel took me and restored me to the place where I was at the beginning.",
        "17:3": "And having come to myself, I gave glory to God, who counted me worthy of such honor.",
        "17:4": "Wherefore do ye also, brethren, who obtained such a revelation, yourselves also glorify God, so that He also may glorify you, now and ever, and to all eternity. Amen."

        "4:7": "But Baruch put dust on his head and sat and wailed this lamentation, saying: Why has Jerusalem been devastated? Because of the sins of the beloved people she was delivered into the hands of enemies -- because of our sins and those of the people.",
        "4:8": "But let not the lawless ones boast and say: \"We were strong enough to take the city of God by our might;\" but it was delivered to you because of our sins.",
        "4:9": "And God will pity us and cause us to return to our city, but you will not survive!",
        "4:10": "Blessed are our fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, for they departed from this world and did not see the destruction of this city.",
        "4:11": "When he had said this, Baruch departed from the city, weeping and saying: Grieving because of you, Jerusalem, I went out from you.",
        "4:12": "And he remained sitting in a tomb, while the angels came to him and explained to him everything that the Lord revealed to him through them.",
        "5:1": "But Abimelech took the figs in the burning heat; and coming upon a tree, he sat under its shade to rest a bit.",
        "5:2": "And leaning his head on the basket of figs, he fell asleep and slept for 66 years; and he was not awakened from his slumber.",
        "5:3": "And afterward, when he awoke from his sleep, he said: I slept sweetly for a little while, but my head is heavy because I did not get enough sleep.",
        "5:4": "Then he uncovered the basket of figs and found them dripping milk.",
        "5:5": "And he said: I would like to sleep a little longer, because my head is heavy. But I am afraid that I might fall asleep and be late in awakening and my father Jeremiah would think badly of me; for if he were not in a hurry, he would not have sent me today at daybreak.",
        "5:6": "So I will get up, and proceed in the burning heat; for isn't there heat, isn't there toil every day?",
        "5:7": "So he got up and took the basket of figs and placed it on his shoulders, and he entered into Jerusalem and did not recognize it -- neither his own house, nor the place -- nor did he find his own family or any of his acquaintances.",
        "5:8": "And he said: The Lord be blessed, for a great trance has come over me today!",
        "5:9": "This is not the city Jerusalem -- and I have lost my way because I came by the mountain road when I arose from my sleep; and since my head was heavy because I did not get enough sleep, I lost my way.",
        "5:10": "It will seem incredible to Jeremiah that I lost my way!",
        "5:11": "And he departed from the city; and as he searched he saw the landmarks of the city, and he said: Indeed, this is the city; I lost my way.",
        "5:12": "And again he returned to the city and searched, and found no one of his own people; and he said: The Lord be blessed, for a great trance has come over me!",
        "5:13": "And again he departed from the city, and he stayed there grieving, not knowing where he should go.",
        "5:14": "And he put down the basket, saying: I will sit here until the Lord takes this trance from me.",
        "5:15": "And as he sat, he saw an old man coming from the field; and Abimelech said to him: I say to you, old man, what city is this?",
        "5:16": "And he said to him: It is Jerusalem.",
        "5:17": "And Abimelech said to him: Where is Jeremiah the priest, and Baruch the secretary, and all the people of this city, for I could not find them?",
        "5:18": "And the old man said to him: Are you not from this city, seeing that you remember Jeremiah today, because you are asking about him after such a long time?",
        "5:19": "For Jeremiah is in Babylon with the people; for they were taken captive by king Nebuchadnezzar, and Jeremiah is with them to preach the good news to them and to teach them the word.",
        "5:20": "As soon as Abimelech heard this from the old man, he said: If you were not an old man, and if it were not for the fact that it is not lawful for a man to upbraid one older than himself, I would laugh at you and say that you are out of your mind -- since you say that the people have been taken captive into Babylon.",
        "5:21": "Even if the heavenly torrents had descended on them, there has not yet been time for them to go into Babylon!",
        "5:22": "For how much time has passed since my father Jeremiah sent me to the estate of Agrippa to bring a few figs, so that I might give them to the sick among the people?",
        "5:23": "And I went and got them, and when I came to a certain tree in the burning heat, I sat to rest a little; and I leaned my head on the basket and fell asleep.",
        "5:24": "And when I awoke I uncovered the basket of figs, supposing that I was late; and I found the figs dripping milk, just as I had collected them.",
        "5:25": "But you claim that the people have been taken captive into Babylon.",
        "5:26": "But that you might know, take the figs and see!",
        "5:27": "And he uncovered the basket of figs for the old man, and he saw them dripping milk.",
        "5:28": "And when the old man saw them, he said: O my son, you are a righteous man, and God did not want you to see the desolation of the city, so he brought this trance upon you.",
        "5:29": "For behold it is 66 years today since the people were taken captive into Babylon.",
        "5:30": "But that you might learn, my son, that what I tell you is true -- look into the field and see that the ripening of the crops has not appeared.",
        "5:31": "And notice that the figs are not in season, and be enlightened.",
        "5:32": "Then Abimelech cried out in a loud voice, saying: I bless you, God of heaven and earth, the Rest of the souls of the righteous in every place!",
        "5:33": "Then he said to the old man: What month is this?",
        "5:34": "And he said: Nisan (which is Abib).",
        "5:35": "And taking some of figs, he gave them to the old man and said to him: May God illumine your way to the city above, Jerusalem. 6",
        "6:1": "After this, Abimelech went out of the city and prayed to the Lord.",
        "6:2": "And behold, an angel of the Lord came and took him by the right hand and brought him back to where Baruch was sitting, and he found him in a tomb.",
        "6:3": "And when they saw each other, they both wept and kissed each other.",
        "6:4": "But when Baruch looked up he saw with his own eyes the figs that were covered in Abimelech's basket.",
        "6:5": "And lifting his eyes to heaven, he prayed, saying:",
        "6:6": "You are the God who gives a reward to those who love you. Prepare yourself, my heart, and rejoice and be glad while you are in your tabernacle, saying to your fleshly house, \"your grief has been changed to joy;\" for the Sufficient One is coming and will deliver you in your tabernacle -- for there is no sin in you.",
        "6:7": "Revive in your tabernacle, in your virginal faith, and believe that you will live!",
        "6:8": "Look at this basket of figs -- for behold, they are 66 years old and have not become shrivelled or rotten, but they are dripping milk.",
        "6:9": "So it will be with you, my flesh, if you do what is commanded you by the angel of righteousness.",
        "6:10": "He who preserved the basket of figs, the same will again preserve you by his power.",
        "6:11": "When Baruch had said this, he said to Abimelech: Stand up and let us pray that the Lord may make known to us how we shall be able to send to Jeremiah in Babylon the report about the shelter provided for you on the way.",
        "6:12": "And Baruch prayed, saying: Lord God, our strength is the elect light which comes forth from your mouth.",
        "6:13": "These, then, are the words which the Lord, the God of Israel, spoke, who led us out of Egypt, out of the great furnace: Because you did not keep my ordinances, but your heart was lifted up, and you were haughty before me, in anger and wrath I delivered you to the furnace in Babylon.",
        "6:14": "What shall we do, and how shall we send this report to Jeremiah in Babylon?",
        "6:15": "And while Baruch was still praying, behold an angel of the Lord came and said all these words to Baruch: Agent of the light, do not be anxious about how you will send to Jeremiah; for an eagle is coming to you at the hour of light tomorrow, and you will direct him to Jeremiah.",
        "6:16": "Therefore, write in a letter: Say to the children of Israel: Let the stranger who comes among you be set apart and let 15 days go by; and after this I will lead you into your city, says the Lord.",
        "6:17": "He who is not separated from Babylon will not enter into the city; and I will punish them by keeping them from being received back by the Babylonians, says the Lord.",
        "6:18": "And when the angel had said this, he departed from Baruch.",
        "6:19": "And Baruch sent to the market of the gentiles and got papyrus and ink and wrote a letter as follows: Baruch, the servant of God, writes to Jeremiah in the captivity of Babylon:",
        "6:20": "Greetings! Rejoice, for God has not allowed us to depart from this body grieving for the city which was laid waste and outraged.",
        "6:21": "Wherefore the Lord has had compassion on our tears, and has remembered the covenant which he established with our fathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.",
        "6:22": "And he sent his angel to me, and he told me these words which I send to you.",
        "6:24": "If, therefore, says the Lord, you listen to my voice, from the mouth of Jeremiah my servant, I will bring the one who listens up from Babylon; but the one who does not listen will become a stranger to Jerusalem and to Babylon.",
        "6:25": "And you will test them by means of the water of the Jordan; whoever does not listen will be exposed -- this is the sign of the great seal.",
        "7:1": "And Baruch got up and departed from the tomb and found the eagle sitting outside the tomb.",
        "7:2": "And the eagle said to him in a human voice: Hail, Baruch, steward of the faith.",
        "7:3": "And Baruch said to him: You who speak are chosen from among all the birds of heaven, for this is clear from the gleam of your eyes; tell me, then, what are you doing here?",
        "7:4": "And the eagle said to him: I was sent here so that you might through me send whatever message you want.",
        "7:5": "And Baruch said to him: Can you carry this message to Jeremiah in Babylon?",
        "7:6": "And the eagle said to him: Indeed, it was for this reason I was sent.",
        "7:7": "And Baruch took the letter, and 15 figs from Abimelech's basket, and tied them to the eagle's neck and said to him: I say to you, king of the birds, go in peace with good health and carry the message for me.",
        "7:8": "Do not be like the raven which Noah sent out and which never came back to him in the ark; but be like the dove which, the third time, brought a report to the righteous one.",
        "7:9": "So you also, take this good message to Jeremiah and to those in bondage with him, that it may be well with you-take this papyrus to the people and to the chosen one of God.",
        "7:10": "Even if all the birds of heaven surround you and want to fight with you, struggle -- the Lord will give you strength.",
        "7:11": "And do not turn aside to the right or to the left, but straight as a speeding arrow, go in the power of God, and the glory of the Lord will be with you the entire way.",
        "7:12": "Then the eagle took flight and went away to Babylon, having the letter tied to his neck; and when he arrived he rested on a post outside the city in a desert place.",
        "7:13": "And he kept silent until Jeremiah came along, for he and some of the people were coming out to bury a corpse outside the city.",
        "7:14": "(For Jeremiah had petitioned king Nebuchadnezzar, saying: \"Give me a place where I may bury those of my people who have died;\" and the king gave it to him.)",
        "7:15": "And as they were coming out with the body, and weeping, they came to where the eagle was.",
        "7:16": "And the eagle cried out in a loud voice, saying: I say to you, Jeremiah the chosen one of God, go and gather together the people and come here so that they may hear a letter which I have brought to you from Baruch and Abimelech.",
        "7:17": "And when Jeremiah heard this, he glorified God; and he went and gathered together the people along with their wives and children, and he came to where the eagle was.",
        "7:18": "And the eagle came down on the corpse, and it revived.",
        "7:19": "(Now this took place so that they might believe.)",
        "7:20": "And all the people were astounded at what had happened, and said: This is the God who appeared to our fathers in the wilderness through Moses, and now he has appeared to us through the eagle.",
        "7:21": "And the eagle said: I say to you, Jeremiah, come, untie this letter and read it to the people -- So he untied the letter and read it to the people.",
        "7:22": "And when the people heard it, they wept and put dust on their heads, and they said to Jeremiah: Deliver us and tell us what to do that we may once again enter our city.",
        "7:23": "And Jeremiah answered and said to them: Do whatever you heard from the letter, and the Lord will lead us into our city.",
        "7:24": "And Jeremiah wrote a letter to Baruch, saying thus: My beloved son, do not be negligent in your prayers, beseeching God on our behalf, that he might direct our way until we come out of the jurisdiction of this lawless king.",
        "7:25": "For you have been found righteous before God, and he did not let you come here, lest you see the affliction which has come upon the people at the hands of the Babylonians.",
        "7:26": "For it is like a father with an only son, who is given over for punishment; and those who see his father and console him cover his face, lest he see how his son is being punished, and be even more ravaged by grief.",
        "7:27": "For thus God took pity on you and did not let you enter Babylon lest you see the affliction of the people.",
        "7:28": "For since we came here, grief has not left us, for 66 years today.",
        "7:29": "For many times when I went out I found some of the people hung up by king Nebuchadnezzar, crying and saying: \"Have mercy on us, God-ZAR!\"",
        "7:30": "When I heard this, I grieved and cried with two-fold mourning, not only because they were hung up, but because they were calling on a foreign God, saying \"Have mercy on us.\"",
        "7:31": "But I remembered days of festivity which we celebrated in Jerusalem before our captivity; and when I remembered, I groaned, and returned to my house wailing and weeping.",
        "7:32": "Now, then, pray in the place where you are -- you and Abimelech -- for this people, that they may listen to my voice and to the decrees of my mouth, so that we may depart from here.",
        "7:33": "For I tell you that the entire time that we have spent here they have kept us in subjection, saying: Recite for us a song from the songs of Zion -- the song of your God.",
        "7:34": "And we reply to them: How shall we sing for you since we are in a foreign land?",
        "7:35": "And after this, Jeremiah tied the letter to the eagle's neck, saying: Go in peace, and may the Lord watch over both of us.",
        "7:36": "And the eagle took flight and came to Jerusalem and gave the letter to Baruch; and when he had untied it he read it and kissed it and wept when he heard about the distresses and afflictions of the people.",
        "7:37": "But Jeremiah took the figs and distributed them to the sick among the people, and he kept teaching them to abstain from the pollutions of the gentiles of Babylon. 6",
        "8:1": "And the day came in which the Lord brought the people out of Babylon.",
        "8:2": "And the Lord said to Jeremiah: Rise up -- you and the people -- and come to the Jordan and say to the people: Let anyone who desires the Lord forsake the works of Babylon.",
        "8:3": "As for the men who took wives from them and the women who took husbands from them -- those who listen to you shall cross over, and you take them into Jerusalem; but those who do not listen to you, do not lead them there.",
        "8:4": "And Jeremiah spoke these words to the people, and they arose and came to the Jordan to cross over.",
        "8:5": "As he told them the words that the Lord had spoken to him, half of those who had taken spouses from them did not wish to listen to Jeremiah, but said to him: We will never forsake our wives, but we will bring them back with us into our city.",
        "8:6": "So they crossed the Jordan and came to Jerusalem.",
        "8:7": "And Jeremiah and Baruch and Abimelech stood up and said: No man joined with Babylonians shall enter this city!",
        "8:8": "And they said to one another: Let us arise and return to Babylon to our place -- And they departed.",
        "8:9": "But while they were coming to Babylon, the Babylonians came out to meet them, saying: You shall not enter our city, for you hated us and you left us secretly; therefore you cannot come in with us.",
        "8:10": "For we have taken a solemn oath together in the name of our god to receive neither you nor your children, since you left us secretly.",
        "8:11": "And when they heard this, they returned and came to a desert place some distance from Jerusalem and built a city for themselves and named it 'SAMARIA.'",
        "8:12": "And Jeremiah sent to them, saying: Repent, for the angel of righteousness is coming and will lead you to your exalted place.",
        "9:1": "Now those who were with Jeremiah were rejoicing and offering sacrifices on behalf of the people for nine days.",
        "9:2": "But on the tenth, Jeremiah alone offered sacrifice.",
        "9:3": "And he prayed a prayer, saying: Holy, holy, holy, fragrant aroma of the living trees, true light that enlightens me until I ascend to you;",
        "9:4": "For your mercy, I beg you -- for the sweet voice of the two seraphim, I beg -- for another fragrant aroma.",
        "9:5": "And may Michael, archangel of righteousness, who opens the gates to the righteous, be my guardian (?) until he causes the righteous to enter.",
        "9:6": "I beg you, almighty Lord of all creation, unbegotten and incomprehensible, in whom all judgment was hidden before these things came into existence.",
        "9:7": "When Jeremiah had said this, and while he was standing in the altar-area with Baruch and Abimelech, he became as one whose soul had departed.",
        "9:8": "And Baruch and Abimelech were weeping and crying out in a loud voice: Woe to us! For our father Jeremiah has left us -- the priest of God has departed!",
        "9:9": "And all the people heard their weeping and they all ran to them and saw Jeremiah lying on the ground as if dead.",
        "9:10": "And they tore their garments and put dust on their heads and wept bitterly.",
        "9:11": "And after this they prepared to bury him.",
        "9:12": "And behold, there came a voice saying: Do not bury the one who yet lives, for his soul is returning to his body!",
        "9:13": "And when they heard the voice they did not bury him, but stayed around his tabernacle for three days saying, \"when will he arise?\"",
        "9:14": "And after three days his soul came back into his body and he raised his voice in the midst of them all and said: Glorify God with one voice! All of you glorify God and the son of God who awakens us -- messiah Jesus -- the light of all the ages, the inextinguishable lamp, the life of faith.",
        "9:15": "But after these times there shall be 477 years more and he comes to earth.",
        "9:16": "And the tree of life planted in the midst of paradise will cause all the unfruitful trees to bear fruit, and will grow and sprout forth.",
        "9:17": "And the trees that had sprouted and became haughty and said: \"We have supplied our power (?) to the air,\" he will cause them to wither, with the grandeur of their branches, and he will cause them to be judged -- that firmly rooted tree!",
        "9:18": "And what is crimson will become white as wool -- the snow will be blackened -- the sweet waters will become salty, and the salty sweet, in the intense light of the joy of God.",
        "9:19": "And he will bless the isles so that they become fruitful by the word of the mouth of his messiah.",
        "9:20": "For he shall come, and he will go out and choose for himself twelve apostles to proclaim the news among the nations-- he whom I have seen adorned by his father and coming into the world on the Mount of Olives -- and he shall fill the hungry souls.",
        "9:21": "When Jeremiah was saying this concerning the son of God -- that he is coming into the world -- the people became very angry and said: This is a repetition of the words spoken by Isaiah son of Amos, when he said: I saw God and the son of God.",
        "9:22": "Come, then, and let us not kill him by the same sort of death with which we killed Isaiah, but let us stone him with stones.",
        "9:23": "And Baruch and Abimelech were greatly grieved because they wanted to hear in full the mysteries that he had seen.",
        "9:24": "But Jeremiah said to them: Be silent and weep not, for they cannot kill me until I describe for you everything I saw.",
        "9:25": "And he said to them: Bring a stone here to me.",
        "9:26": "And he set it up and said: Light of the ages, make this stone to become like me in appearance, until I have described to Baruch and Abimelech everything I saw.",
        "9:27": "Then the stone, by God's command, took on the appearance of Jeremiah.",
        "9:28": "And they were stoning the stone, supposing that it was Jeremiah!",
        "9:29": "But Jeremiah delivered to Baruch and to Abimelech all the mysteries he had seen, and forthwith he stood in the midst of the people desiring to complete his ministry.",
        "9:30": "Then the stone cried out, saying: O foolish children of Israel, why do you stone me, supposing that I am Jeremiah? Behold, Jeremiah is standing in your midst!",
        "9:31": "And when they saw him, immediately they rushed upon him with many stones, and his ministry was fulfilled.",
        "9:32": "And when Baruch and Abimelech came, they buried him, and taking the stone they placed it on his tomb and inscribed it thus: This is the stone that was the ally of Jeremiah."

        "1:3": "Her parents also were righteous, and taught their daughter according to the law of Moses.",
        "1:4": "Now Joacim was a great rich man, and had a fair garden joining unto his house: and to him resorted the Jews; because he was more honourable than all others.",
        "1:5": "The same year were appointed two of the ancients of the people to be judges, such as the Lord spake of, that wickedness came from Babylon from ancient judges, who seemed to govern the people.",
        "1:6": "These kept much at Joacim’s house: and all that had any suits in law came unto them.",
        "1:7": "Now when the people departed away at noon, Susanna went into her husband’s garden to walk.",
        "1:8": "And the two elders saw her going in every day, and walking; so that their lust was inflamed toward her.",
        "1:9": "And they perverted their own mind, and turned away their eyes, that they might not look unto heaven, nor remember just judgments.",
        "1:10": "And albeit they both were wounded with her love, yet durst not one shew another his grief.",
        "1:11": "For they were ashamed to declare their lust, that they desired to have to do with her.",
        "1:12": "Yet they watched diligently from day to day to see her.",
        "1:13": "And the one said to the other, Let us now go home: for it is dinner time.",
        "1:14": "So when they were gone out, they parted the one from the other, and turning back again they came to the same place; and after that they had asked one another the cause, they acknowledged their lust: then appointed they a time both together, when they might find her alone.",
        "1:15": "And it fell out, as they watched a fit time, she went in as before with two maids only, and she was desirous to wash herself in the garden: for it was hot.",
        "1:16": "And there was no body there save the two elders, that had hid themselves, and watched her.",
        "1:17": "Then she said to her maids, Bring me oil and washing balls, and shut the garden doors, that I may wash me.",
        "1:18": "And they did as she bade them, and shut the garden doors, and went out themselves at privy doors to fetch the things that she had commanded them: but they saw not the elders, because they were hid.",

        "8:6": "And they spoke and said to each other, Behold the sight that we saw last night is hidden from the king, it has not been made known to him.",
        "8:7": "And should this thing get known to the king in the latter days, he will say to us, Why have you concealed this matter from me, and then we shall all suffer death; therefore, now let us go and tell the king the sight which we saw, and the interpretation thereof, and we shall then remain clear.",
        "8:8": "And they did so, and they all went to the king and bowed down to him to the ground, and they said, May the king live, may the king live.",
        "8:9": "We heard that a son was born to Terah the son of Nahor, the prince of thy host, and we yesternight came to his house, and we ate and drank and rejoiced with him that night.",
        "8:10": "And when thy servants went out from the house of Terah, to go to our respective homes to abide there for the night, we lifted up our eyes to heaven, and we saw a great star coming from the east, and the same star ran with great speed, and swallowed up four great stars, from the four sides of the heavens.",
        "8:11": "And thy servants were astonished at the sight which we saw, and were greatly terrified, and we made our judgment upon the sight, and knew by our wisdom the proper interpretation thereof, that this thing applies to the child that is born to Terah, who will grow up and multiply greatly, and become powerful, and kill all the kings of the earth, and inherit all their lands, he and his seed forever.",
        "8:12": "And now our lord and king, behold we have truly acquainted thee with what we have seen concerning this child.",
        "8:13": "If it seemeth good to the king to give his father value for this child, we will slay him before he shall grow up and increase in the land, and his evil increase against us, that we and our children perish through his evil.",
        "8:14": "And the king heard their words and they seemed good in his sight, and he sent and called for Terah, and Terah came before the king.",
        "8:15": "And the king said to Terah, I have been told that a son was yesternight born to thee, and after this manner was observed in the heavens at his birth.",
        "8:16": "And now therefore give me the child, that we may slay him before his evil springs up against us, and I will give thee for his value, thy house full of silver and gold.",
        "8:17": "And Terah answered the king and said to him: My Lord and king, I have heard thy words, and thy servant shall do all that his king desireth.",
        "8:18": "But my lord and king, I will tell thee what happened to me yesternight, that I may see what advice the king will give his servant, and then I will answer the king upon what he has just spoken; and the king said, Speak.",
        "8:19": "And Terah said to the king, Ayon, son of Mored, came to me yesternight, saying,",
        "8:20": "Give unto me the great and beautiful horse that the king gave thee, and I will give thee silver and gold, and straw and provender for its value; and I said to him, Wait till I see the king concerning thy words, and behold whatever the king saith, that will I do.",
        "8:21": "And now my lord and king, behold I have made this thing known to thee, and the advice which my king will give unto his servant, that will I follow.",
        "8:22": "And the king heard the words of Terah, and his anger was kindled and he considered him in the light of a fool.",
        "8:23": "And the king answered Terah, and he said to him, Art thou so silly, ignorant, or deficient in understanding, to do this thing, to give thy beautiful horse for silver and gold or even for straw and provender?",
        "8:24": "Art thou so short of silver and gold, that thou shouldst do this thing, because thou canst not obtain straw and provender to feed thy horse? and what is silver and gold to thee, or straw and provender, that thou shouldst give away that fine horse which I gave thee, like which there is none to be had on the whole earth?",
        "8:25": "And the king left off speaking, and Terah answered the king, saying, Like unto this has the king spoken to his servant;",
        "8:26": "I beseech thee, my lord and king, what is this which thou didst say unto me, saying, Give thy son that we may slay him, and I will give thee silver and gold for his value; what shall I do with silver and gold after the death of my son? who shall inherit me? surely then at my death, the silver and gold will return to my king who gave it.",
        "8:27": "And when the king heard the words of Terah, and the parable which he brought concerning the king, it grieved him greatly and he was vexed at this thing, and his anger burned within him.",
        "8:28": "And Terah saw that the anger of the king was kindled against him, and he answered the king, saying, All that I have is in the king's power; whatever the king desireth to do to his servant, that let him do, yea, even my son, he is in the king's power, without value in exchange, he and his two brothers that are older than he.",
        "8:29": "And the king said to Terah, No, but I will purchase thy younger son for a price.",
        "8:30": "And Terah answered the king, saying, I beseech thee my lord and king to let thy servant speak a word before thee, and let the king hear the word of his servant, and Terah said, Let my king give me three days' time till I consider this matter within myself, and consult with my family concerning the words of my king; and he pressed the king greatly to agree to this.",
        "8:31": "And the king hearkened to Terah, and he did so and he gave him three days' time, and Terah went out from the king's presence, and he came home to his family and spoke to them all the words of the king; and the people were greatly afraid.",
        "8:32": "And it was in the third day that the king sent to Terah, saying, Send me thy son for a price as I spoke to thee; and shouldst thou not do this, I will send and slay all thou hast in thy house, so that thou shalt not even have a dog remaining.",
        "8:33": "And Terah hastened, (as the thing was urgent from the king), and he took a child from one of his servants, which his handmaid had born to him that day, and Terah brought the child to the king and received value for him.",
        "8:34": "And the Lord was with Terah in this matter, that Nimrod might not cause Abram's death, and the king took the child from Terah and with all his might dashed his head to the ground, for he thought it had been Abram; and this was concealed from him from that day, and it was forgotten by the king, as it was the will of Providence not to suffer Abram's death.",
        "8:35": "And Terah took Abram his son secretly, together with his mother and nurse, and he concealed them in a cave, and he brought them their provisions monthly.",
        "8:36": "And the Lord was with Abram in the cave and he grew up, and Abram was in the cave ten years, and the king and his princes, soothsayers and sages, thought that the king had killed Abram.",
        "9:1": "And Haran, the son of Terah, Abram's oldest brother, took a wife in those days.",
        "9:2": "Haran was thirty-nine years old when he took her; and the wife of Haran conceived and bare a son, and he called his name Lot.",
        "9:3": "And she conceived again and bare a daughter, and she called her name Milca; and she again conceived and bare a daughter, and she called her name Sarai.",
        "9:4": "Haran was forty-two years old when he begat Sarai, which was in the tenth year of the life of Abram; and in those days Abram and his mother and nurse went out from the cave, as the king and his subjects had forgotten the affair of Abram.",
        "9:5": "And when Abram came out from the cave, he went to Noah and his son Shem, and he remained with them to learn the instruction of the Lord and his ways, and no man knew where Abram was, and Abram served Noah and Shem his son for a long time.",
        "9:6": "And Abram was in Noah's house thirty-nine years, and Abram knew the Lord from three years old, and he went in the ways of the Lord until the day of his death, as Noah and his son Shem had taught him; and all the sons of the earth in those days greatly transgressed against the Lord, and they rebelled against him and they served other gods, and they forgot the Lord who had created them in the earth; and the inhabitants of the earth made unto themselves, at that time, every man his god; gods of wood and stone which could neither speak, hear, nor deliver, and the sons of men served them and they became their gods.",
        "9:7": "And the king and all his servants, and Terah with all his household were then the first of those that served gods of wood and stone.",
        "9:8": "And Terah had twelve gods of large size, made of wood and stone, after the twelve months of the year, and he served each one monthly, and every month Terah would bring his meat offering and drink offering to his gods; thus did Terah all the days.",
        "9:9": "And all that generation were wicked in the sight of the Lord, and they thus made every man his god, but they forsook the Lord who had created them.",
        "9:10": "And there was not a man found in those days in the whole earth, who knew the Lord (for they served each man his own God) except Noah and his household, and all those who were under his counsel knew the Lord in those days.",
        "9:11": "And Abram the son of Terah was waxing great in those days in the house of Noah, and no man knew it, and the Lord was with him.",
        "9:12": "And the Lord gave Abram an understanding heart, and he knew all the works of that generation were vain, and that all their gods were vain and were of no avail.",
        "9:13": "And Abram saw the sun shining upon the earth, and Abram said unto himself Surely now this sun that shines upon the earth is God, and him will I serve.",
        "9:14": "And Abram served the sun in that day and he prayed to him, and when evening came the sun set as usual, and Abram said within himself, Surely this cannot be God?",
        "9:15": "And Abram still continued to speak within himself, Who is he who made the heavens and the earth? who created upon earth? where is he?",
        "9:16": "And night darkened over him, and he lifted up his eyes toward the west, north, south, and east, and he saw that the sun had vanished from the earth, and the day became dark.",
        "9:17": "And Abram saw the stars and moon before him, and he said, Surely this is the God who created the whole earth as well as man, and behold these his servants are gods around him: and Abram served the moon and prayed to it all that night.",
        "9:18": "And in the morning when it was light and the sun shone upon the earth as usual, Abram saw all the things that the Lord God had made upon earth.",
        "9:19": "And Abram said unto himself Surely these are not gods that made the earth and all mankind, but these are the servants of God, and Abram remained in the house of Noah and there knew the Lord and his ways' and he served the Lord all the days of his life, and all that generation forgot the Lord, and served other gods of wood and stone, and rebelled all their days.",
        "9:20": "And king Nimrod reigned securely, and all the earth was under his control, and all the earth was of one tongue and words of union.",
        "9:21": "And all the princes of Nimrod and his great men took counsel together; Phut, Mitzraim, Cush and Canaan with their families, and they said to each other, Come let us build ourselves a city and in it a strong tower, and its top reaching heaven, and we will make ourselves famed, so that we may reign upon the whole world, in order that the evil of our enemies may cease from us, that we may reign mightily over them, and that we may not become scattered over the earth on account of their wars.",
        "9:22": "And they all went before the king, and they told the king these words, and the king agreed with them in this affair, and he did so.",
        "9:23": "And all the families assembled consisting of about six hundred thousand men, and they went to seek an extensive piece of ground to build the city and the tower, and they sought in the whole earth and they found none like one valley at the east of the land of Shinar, about two days' walk, and they journeyed there and they dwelt there.",
        "9:24": "And they began to make bricks and burn fires to build the city and the tower that they had imagined to complete.",
        "9:25": "And the building of the tower was unto them a transgression and a sin, and they began to build it, and whilst they were building against the Lord God of heaven, they imagined in their hearts to war against him and to ascend into heaven.",
        "9:26": "And all these people and all the families divided themselves in three parts; the first said We will ascend into heaven and fight against him; the second said, We will ascend to heaven and place our own gods there and serve them; and the third part said, We will ascend to heaven and smite him with bows and spears; and God knew all their works and all their evil thoughts, and he saw the city and the tower which they were building.",
        "9:27": "And when they were building they built themselves a great city and a very high and strong tower; and on account of its height the mortar and bricks did not reach the builders in their ascent to it, until those who went up had completed a full year, and after that, they reached to the builders and gave them the mortar and the bricks; thus was it done daily.",
        "9:28": "And behold these ascended and others descended the whole day; and if a brick should fall from their hands and get broken, they would all weep over it, and if a man fell and died, none of them would look at him.",
        "9:29": "And the Lord knew their thoughts, and it came to pass when they were building they cast the arrows toward the heavens, and all the arrows fell upon them filled with blood, and when they saw them they said to each other, Surely we have slain all those that are in heaven.",
        "9:30": "For this was from the Lord in order to cause them to err, and in order; to destroy them from off the face of the ground.",
        "9:31": "And they built the tower and the city, and they did this thing daily until many days and years were elapsed.",
        "9:32": "And God said to the seventy angels who stood foremost before him, to those who were near to him, saying, Come let us descend and confuse their tongues, that one man shall not understand the language of his neighbor, and they did so unto them.",
        "9:33": "And from that day following, they forgot each man his neighbor's tongue, and they could not understand to speak in one tongue, and when the builder took from the hands of his neighbor lime or stone which he did not order, the builder would cast it away and throw it upon his neighbor, that he would die.",
        "9:34": "And they did so many days, and they killed many of them in this manner.",
        "9:35": "And the Lord smote the three divisions that were there, and he punished them according to their works and designs; those who said, We will ascend to heaven and serve our gods, became like apes and elephants; and those who said, We will smite the heaven with arrows, the Lord killed them, one man through the hand of his neighbor; and the third division of those who said, We will ascend to heaven and fight against him, the Lord scattered them throughout the earth.",
        "9:36": "And those who were left amongst them, when they knew and understood the evil which was coming upon them, they forsook the building, and they also became scattered upon the face of the whole earth.",
        "9:37": "And they ceased building the city and the tower; therefore he called that place Babel, for there the Lord confounded the Language of the whole earth; behold it was at the east of the land of Shinar.",

        "11:28": "And it was on the next day that Abram directed his mother concerning the savory meat, and his mother rose and fetched three fine kids from the flock, and she made of them some excellent savory meat, such as her son was fond of, and she gave it to her son Abram; and Terah his father did not know of it.",

        "11:32": "And he called out and said, Wo unto my father and this wicked generation, whose hearts are all inclined to vanity, who serve these idols of wood and stone which can neither eat, smell, hear nor speak, who have mouths without speech, eyes without sight, ears without hearing, hands without feeling, and legs which cannot move; like them are those that made them and that trust in them.",
        "11:33": "And when Abram saw all these things his anger was kindled against his father, and he hastened and took a hatchet in his hand, and came unto the chamber of the gods, and he broke all his father's gods.",
        "11:34": "And when he had done breaking the images, he placed the hatchet in the hand of the great god which was there before them, and he went out; and Terah his father came home, for he had heard at the door the sound of the striking of the hatchet; so Terah came into the house to know what this was about.",

        "11:37": "And when Terah saw this his anger was greatly kindled, and he hastened and went from the room to Abram.",
        "11:38": "And he found Abram his son still sitting in the house; and he said to him, What is this work thou hast done to my gods?",
        "11:39": "And Abram answered Terah his father and he said, Not so my lord, for I brought savory meat before them, and when I came nigh to them with the meat that they might eat, they all at once stretched forth their hands to eat before the great one had put forth his hand to eat.",
        "11:40": "And the large one saw their works that they did before him, and his anger was violently kindled against them, and he went and took the hatchet that was in the house and came to them and broke them all, and behold the hatchet is yet in his hand as thou seest.",
        "11:41": "And Terah's anger was kindled against his son Abram, when he spoke this; and Terah said to Abram his son in his anger, What is this tale that thou hast told? Thou speakest lies to me.",
        "11:42": "Is there in these gods spirit, soul or power to do all thou hast told me? Are they not wood and stone, and have I not myself made them, and canst thou speak such lies, saying that the large god that was with them smote them? It is thou that didst place the hatchet in his hands, and then sayest he smote them all.",
        "11:43": "And Abram answered his father and said to him, And how canst thou then serve these idols in whom there is no power to do any thing? Can those idols in which thou trustest deliver thee? can they hear thy prayers when thou callest upon them? can they deliver thee from the hands of thy enemies, or will they fight thy battles for thee against thy enemies, that thou shouldst serve wood and stone which can neither speak nor hear?",
        "11:44": "And now surely it is not good for thee nor for the sons of men that are connected with thee, to do these things; are you so silly, so foolish or so short of understanding that you will serve wood and stone, and do after this manner?",
        "11:45": "And forget the Lord God who made heaven and earth, and who created you in the earth, and thereby bring a great evil upon your souls in this matter by serving stone and wood?",
        "11:46": "Did not our fathers in days of old sin in this matter, and the Lord God of the universe brought the waters of the flood upon them and destroyed the whole earth?",
        "11:47": "And how can you continue to do this and serve gods of wood and stone, who cannot hear, or speak, or deliver you from oppression, thereby bringing down the anger of the God of the universe upon you?",
        "11:48": "Now therefore my father refrain from this, and bring not evil upon thy soul and the souls of thy household.",
        "11:49": "And Abram hastened and sprang from before his father, and took the hatchet from his father's largest idol, with which Abram broke it and ran away.",
        "11:50": "And Terah, seeing all that Abram had done, hastened to go from his house, and he went to the king and he came before Nimrod and stood before him, and he bowed down to the king; and the king said, What dost thou want?",
        "11:51": "And he said, I beseech thee my lord, to hear me--Now fifty years back a child was born to me, and thus has he done to my gods and thus has he spoken; and now therefore, my lord and king, send for him that he may come before thee, and judge him according to the law, that we may be delivered from his evil.",
        "11:52": "And the king sent three men of his servants, and they went and brought Abram before the king. And Nimrod and all his princes and servants were that day sitting before him, and Terah sat also before them.",
        "11:53": "And the king said to Abram, What is this that thou hast done to thy father and to his gods? And Abram answered the king in the words that he spoke to his father, and he said, The large god that was with them in the house did to them what thou hast heard.",
        "11:54": "And the king said to Abram, Had they power to speak and eat and do as thou hast said? And Abram answered the king, saying, And if there be no power in them why dost thou serve them and cause the sons of men to err through thy follies?",
        "11:55": "Dost thou imagine that they can deliver thee or do anything small or great, that thou shouldst serve them? And why wilt thou not sense the God of the whole universe, who created thee and in whose power it is to kill and keep alive?",
        "11:56": "0 foolish, simple, and ignorant king, woe unto thee forever.",
        "11:57": "I thought thou wouldst teach thy servants the upright way, but thou hast not done this, but hast filled the whole earth with thy sins and the sins of thy people who have followed thy ways.",
        "11:58": "Dost thou not know, or hast thou not heard, that this evil which thou doest, our ancestors sinned therein in days of old, and the eternal God brought the waters of the flood upon them and destroyed them all, and also destroyed the whole earth on their account? And wilt thou and thy people rise up now and do like unto this work, in order to bring down the anger of the Lord God of the universe, and to bring evil upon thee and the whole earth?",
        "11:59": "Now therefore put away this evil deed which thou doest, and serve the God of the universe, as thy soul is in his hands, and then it will be well with thee.",
        "11:60": "And if thy wicked heart will not hearken to my words to cause thee to forsake thy evil ways, and to serve the eternal God, then wilt thou die in shame in the latter days, thou, thy people and all who are connected with thee, hearing thy words or walking in thy evil ways.",
        "11:61": "And when Abram had ceased speaking before the king and princes, Abram lifted up his eyes to the heavens, and he said, The Lord seeth all the wicked, and he will judge them.",
        "12:1": "And when the king heard the words of Abram he ordered him to be put into prison; and Abram was ten days in prison.",
        "12:2": "And at the end of those days the king ordered that all the kings, princes and governors of different provinces and the sages should come before him, and they sat before him, and Abram was still in the house of confinement.",
        "12:3": "And the king said to the princes and sages, Have you heard what Abram, the son of Terah, has done to his father? Thus has he done to him, and I ordered him to be brought before me, and thus has he spoken; his heart did not misgive him, neither did he stir in my presence, and behold now he is confined in the prison.",
        "12:4": "And therefore decide what judgment is due to this man who reviled the king; who spoke and did all the things that you heard.",
        "12:5": "And they all answered the king saying, The man who revileth the king should be hanged upon a tree; but having done all the things that he said, and having despised our gods, he must therefore be burned to death, for this is the law in this matter.",
        "12:6": "If it pleaseth the king to do this, let him order his servants to kindle a fire both night and day in thy brick furnace, and then we will cast this man into it. And the king did so, and he commanded his servants that they should prepare a fire for three days and three nights in the king's furnace, that is in Casdim; and the king ordered them to take Abram from prison and bring him out to be burned.",
        "12:7": "And all the king's servants, princes, lords, governors, and judges, and all the inhabitants of the land, about nine hundred thousand men, stood opposite the furnace to see Abram.",
        "12:8": "And all the women and little ones crowded upon the roofs and towers to see what was doing with Abram, and they all stood together at a distance; and there was not a man left that did not come on that day to behold the scene.",
        "12:9": "And when Abram was come, the conjurors of the king and the sages saw Abram, and they cried out to the king, saying, Our sovereign lord, surely this is the man whom we know to have been the child at whose birth the great star swallowed the four stars, which we declared to the king now fifty years since.",
        "12:10": "And behold now his father has also transgressed thy commands, and mocked thee by bringing thee another child, which thou didst kill.",
        "12:11": "And when the king heard their words, he was exceedingly wroth, and he ordered Terah to be brought before him.",
        "12:12": "And the king said, Hast thou heard what the conjurors have spoken? Now tell me truly, how didst thou; and if thou shalt speak truth thou shalt be acquitted.",
        "12:13": "And seeing that the king's anger was so much kindled, Terah said to the king, My lord and king, thou hast heard the truth, and what the sages have spoken is right. And the king said, How couldst thou do this thing, to transgress my orders and to give me a child that thou didst not beget, and to take value for him?",
        "12:14": "And Terah answered the king, Because my tender feelings were excited for my son, at that time, and I took a son of my handmaid, and I brought him to the king.",
        "12:15": "And the king said Who advised thee to this? Tell me, do not hide aught from me, and then thou shalt not die.",
        "12:16": "And Terah was greatly terrified in the king's presence, and he said to the king, It was Haran my eldest son who advised me to this; and Haran was in those days that Abram was born, two and thirty years old.",
        "12:17": "But Haran did not advise his father to anything, for Terah said this to the king in order to deliver his soul from the king, for he feared greatly; and the king said to Terah, Haran thy son who advised thee to this shall die through fire with Abram; for the sentence of death is upon him for having rebelled against the king's desire in doing this thing.",
        "12:18": "And Haran at that time felt inclined to follow the ways of Abram, but he kept it within himself.",
        "12:19": "And Haran said in his heart, Behold now the king has seized Abram on account of these things which Abram did, and it shall come to pass, that if Abram prevail over the king I will follow him, but if the king prevail I will go after the king.",
        "12:20": "And when Terah had spoken this to the king concerning Haran his son, the king ordered Haran to be seized with Abram.",
        "12:21": "And they brought them both, Abram and Haran his brother, to cast them into the fire; and all the inhabitants of the land and the king's servants and princes and all the women and little ones were there, standing that day over them.",
        "12:22": "And the king's servants took Abram and his brother, and they stripped them of all their clothes excepting their lower garments which were upon them.",
        "12:23": "And they bound their hands and feet with linen cords, and the servants of the king lifted them up and cast them both into the furnace.",
        "12:24": "And the Lord loved Abram and he had compassion over him, and the Lord came down and delivered Abram from the fire and he was not burned.",
        "12:25": "But all the cords with which they bound him were burned, while Abram remained and walked about in the fire.",
        "12:26": "And Haran died when they had cast him into the fire, and he was burned to ashes, for his heart was not perfect with the Lord; and those men who cast him into the fire, the flame of the fire spread over them, and they were burned, and twelve men of them died.",
        "12:27": "And Abram walked in the midst of the fire three days and three nights, and all the servants of the king saw him walking in the fire, and they came and told the king, saying, Behold we have seen Abram walking about in the midst of the fire, and even the lower garments which are upon him are not burned, but the cord with which he was bound is burned.",
        "12:28": "And when the king heard their words his heart fainted and he would not believe them; so he sent other faithful princes to see this matter, and they went and saw it and told it to the king; and the king rose to go and see it, and he saw Abram walking to and fro in the midst of the fire, and he saw Haran's body burned, and the king wondered greatly.",
        "12:29": "And the king ordered Abram to be taken out from the fire; and his servants approached to take him out and they could not, for the fire was round about and the flame ascending toward them from the furnace.",
        "12:30": "And the king's servants fled from it, and the king rebuked them, saying, Make haste and bring Abram out of the fire that you shall not die.",
        "12:31": "And the servants of the king again approached to bring Abram out, and the flames came upon them and burned their faces so that eight of them died.",
        "12:32": "And when the king saw that his servants could not approach the fire lest they should be burned, the king called to Abram, O servant of the God who is in heaven, go forth from amidst the fire and come hither before me; and Abram hearkened to the voice of the king, and he went forth from the fire and came and stood before the king.",
        "12:33": "And when Abram came out the king and all his servants saw Abram coming before the king, with his lower garments upon him, for they were not burned, but the cord with which he was bound was burned.",
        "12:34": "And the king said to Abram, How is it that thou wast not burned in the fire?",
        "12:35": "And Abram said to the king, The God of heaven and earth in whom I trust and who has all in his power, he delivered me from the fire into which thou didst cast me.",
        "12:36": "And Haran the brother of Abram was burned to ashes, and they sought for his body, and they found it consumed.",
        "12:37": "And Haran was eighty-two years old when he died in the fire of Casdim. And the king, princes, and inhabitants of the land, seeing that Abram was delivered from the fire, they came and bowed down to Abram.",
        "12:38": "And Abram said to them, Do not bow down to me, but bow down to the God of the world who made you, and serve him, and go in his ways for it is he who delivered me from out of this fire, and it is he who created the souls and spirits of all men, and formed man in his mother's womb, and brought him forth into the world, and it is he who will deliver those who trust in him from all pain.",
        "12:39": "And this thing seemed very wonderful in the eyes of the king and princes, that Abram was saved from the fire and that Haran was burned; and the king gave Abram many presents and he gave him his two head servants from the king's house; the name of one was Oni and the name of the other was Eliezer.",
        "12:40": "And all the kings, princes and servants gave Abram many gifts of silver and gold and pearl, and the king and his princes sent him away, and he went in peace.",
        "12:41": "And Abram went forth from the king in peace, and many of the king's servants followed him, and about three hundred men joined him.",
        "12:42": "And Abram returned on that day and went to his father's house, he and the men that followed him, and Abram served the Lord his God all the days of his life, and he walked in his ways and followed his law.",
        "12:43": "And from that day forward Abram inclined the hearts of the sons of men to serve the Lord.",
        "12:44": "And at that time Nahor and Abram took unto themselves wives, the daughters of their brother Haran; the wife of Nahor was Milca and the name of Abram's wife was Sarai. And Sarai, wife of Abram, was barren; she had no offspring in those days.",
        "12:45": "And at the expiration of two years from Abram's going out of the fire, that is in the fifty-second year of his life, behold king Nimrod sat in Babel upon the throne, and the king fell asleep and dreamed that he was standing with his troops and hosts in a valley opposite the king's furnace.",
        "12:46": "And he lifted up his eyes and saw a man in the likeness of Abram coming forth from the furnace, and that he came and stood before the king with his drawn sword, and then sprang to the king with his sword, when the king fled from the man, for he was afraid; and while he was running, the man threw an egg upon the king's head, and the egg became a great river.",
        "12:47": "And the king dreamed that all his troops sank in that river and died, and the king took flight with three men who were before him and he escaped.",
        "12:48": "And the king looked at these men and they were clothed in princely dresses as the garments of kings, and had the appearance and majesty of kings.",
        "12:49": "And while they were running, the river again turned to an egg before the king, and there came forth from the egg a young bird which came before the king, and flew at his head and plucked out the king's eye.",
        "12:50": "And the king was grieved at the sight, and he awoke out of his sleep and his spirit was agitated; and he felt a great terror.",
        "12:51": "And in the morning the king rose from his couch in fear, and he ordered all the wise men and magicians to come before him, when the king related his dream to them.",
        "12:52": "And a wise servant of the king, whose name was Anuki, answered the king, saying, This is nothing else but the evil of Abram and his seed which will spring up against my Lord and king in the latter days.",
        "12:53": "And behold the day will come when Abram and his seed and the children of his household will war with my king, and they will smite all the king's hosts and his troops.",
        "12:54": "And as to what thou hast said concerning three men which thou didst see like unto thyself, and which did escape, this means that only thou wilt escape with three kings from the kings of the earth who will be with thee in battle.",
        "12:55": "And that which thou sawest of the river which turned to an egg as at first, and the young bird plucking out thine eye, this means nothing else but the seed of Abram which will slay the king in latter days.",
        "12:56": "This is my king's dream, and this is its interpretation, and the dream is true, and the interpretation which thy servant has given thee is right.",
        "12:57": "Now therefore my king, surely thou knowest that it is now fifty-two years since thy sages saw this at the birth of Abram, and if my king will suffer Abram to live in the earth it will be to the injury of my lord and king, for all the days that Abram liveth neither thou nor thy kingdom will be established, for this was known formerly at his birth; and why will not my king slay him, that his evil may be kept from thee in latter days?",
        "12:58": "And Nimrod hearkened to the voice of Anuki, and he sent some of his servants in secret to go and seize Abram, and bring him before the king to suffer death.",
        "12:59": "And Eliezer, Abram's servant whom the king had given him, was at that time in the presence of the king, and he heard what Anuki had advised the king, and what the king had said to cause Abram's death.",
        "12:60": "And Eliezer said to Abram, Hasten, rise up and save thy soul, that thou mayest not die through the hands of the king, for thus did he see in a dream concerning thee, and thus did Anuki interpret it, and thus also did Anuki advise the king concerning thee.",
        "12:61": "And Abram hearkened to the voice of Eliezer, and Abram hastened and ran for safety to the house of Noah and his son Shem, and he concealed himself there and found a place of safety; and the king's servants came to Abram's house to seek him, but they could not find him, and they searched through out the country and he was not to be found, and they went and searched in every direction and he was not to be met with.",
        "12:62": "And when the king's servants could not find Abram they returned to the king, but the king's anger against Abram was stilled, as they did not find him, and the king drove from his mind this matter concerning Abram.",
        "12:63": "And Abram was concealed in Noah's house for one month, until the king had forgotten this matter, but Abram was still afraid of the king; and Terah came to see Abram his son secretly in the house of Noah, and Terah was very great in the eyes of the king.",
        "12:64": "And Abram said to his father, Dost thou not know that the king thinketh to slay me, and to annihilate my name from the earth by the advice of his wicked counsellors?",
        "12:65": "Now whom hast thou here and what hast thou in this land? Arise, let us go together to the land of Canaan, that we may be delivered from his hand, lest thou perish also through him in the latter days.",
        "12:66": "Dost thou not know or hast thou not heard, that it is not through love that Nimrod giveth thee all this honor, but it is only for his benefit that he bestoweth all this good upon thee?",
        "12:67": "And if he do unto thee greater good than this, surely these are only vanities of the world, for wealth and riches cannot avail in the day of wrath and anger.",
        "12:68": "Now therefore hearken to my voice, and let us arise and go to the land of Canaan, out of the reach of injury from Nimrod; and serve thou the Lord who created thee in the earth and it will be well with thee; and cast away all the vain things which thou pursuest.",
        "12:69": "And Abram ceased to speak, when Noah and his son Shem answered Terah, saying, True is the word which Abram hath said unto thee.",
        "12:70": "And Terah hearkened to the voice of his son Abram, and Terah did all that Abram said, for this was from the Lord, that the king should not cause Abram's death.",
        "13:1": "And Terah took his son Abram and his grandson Lot, the son of Haran, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, the wife of his son Abram, and all the souls of his household and went with them from Ur Casdim to go to the land of Canaan. And when they came as far as the land of Haran they remained there, for it was exceedingly good land for pasture, and of sufficient extent for those who accompanied them.",
        "13:2": "And the people of the land of Haran saw that Abram was good and upright with God and men, and that the Lord his God was with him, and some of the people of the land of Haran came and joined Abram, and he taught them the instruction of the Lord and his ways; and these men remained with Abram in his house and they adhered to him.",
        "13:3": "And Abram remained in the land three years, and at the expiration of three years the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him; I am the Lord who brought thee forth from Ur Casdim, and delivered thee from the hands of all thine enemies.",
        "13:4": "And now therefore if thou wilt hearken to my voice and keep my commandments, my statutes and my laws, then will I cause thy enemies to fall before thee, and I will multiply thy seed like the stars of heaven, and I will send my blessing upon all the works of thy hands, and thou shalt lack nothing.",
        "13:5": "Arise now, take thy wife and all belonging to thee and go to the land of Canaan and remain there, and I will there be unto thee for a God, and I will bless thee. And Abram rose and took his wife and all belonging to him, and he went to the land of Canaan as the Lord had told him; and Abram was fifty years old when he went from Haran.",
        "13:6": "And Abram came to the land of Canaan and dwelt in the midst of the city, and he there pitched his tent amongst the children of Canaan, inhabitants of the land.",
        "13:7": "And the Lord appeared to Abram when he came to the land of Canaan, and said to him, This is the land which I gave unto thee and to thy seed after thee forever, and I will make thy seed like the stars of heaven, and I will give unto thy seed for an inheritance all the lands which thou seest.",
        "13:8": "And Abram built an altar in the place where God had spoken to him, and Abram there called upon the name of the Lord.",
        "13:9": "At that time, at the end of three years of Abram's dwelling in the land of Canaan, in that year Noah died, which was the fifty-eighth year of the life of Abram; and all the days that Noah lived were nine hundred and fifty years and he died.",
        "13:10": "And Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, he, his wife, and all belonging to him, and all those that accompanied him, together with those that joined him from the people of the land; but Nahor, Abram's brother, and Terah his father, and Lot the son of Haran and all belonging to them dwelt in Haran.",
        "13:11": "In the fifth year of Abram's dwelling in the land of Canaan the people of Sodom and Gomorrah and all the cities of the plain revolted from the power of Chedorlaomer, king of Elam; for all the kings of the cities of the plain had served Chedorlaomer for twelve years, and given him a yearly tax, but in those days in the thirteenth year, they rebelled against him.",
        "13:12": "And in the tenth year of Abram's dwelling in the land of Canaan there was war between Nimrod king of Shinar and Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Nimrod came to fight with Chedorlaomer and to subdue him.",
        "13:13": "For Chedorlaomer was at that time one of the princes of the hosts of Nimrod, and when all the people at the tower were dispersed and those that remained were also scattered upon the face of the earth, Chedorlaomer went to the land of Elam and reigned over it and rebelled against his lord.",
        "13:14": "And in those days when Nimrod saw that the cities of the plain had rebelled, he came with pride and anger to war with Chedorlaomer, and Nimrod assembled all his princes and subjects, about seven hundred thousand men, and went against Chedorlaomer, and Chedorlaomer went out to meet him with five thousand men, and they prepared for battle in the valley of Babel which is between Elam and Shinar.",
        "13:15": "And all those kings fought there, and Nimrod and his people were smitten before the people of Chedorlaomer, and there fell from Nimrod's men about six hundred thousand, and Mardon the king's son fell amongst them.",
        "13:16": "And Nimrod fled and returned in shame and disgrace to his land, and he was under subjection to Chedorlaomer for a long time, and Chedorlaomer returned to his land and sent princes of his host to the kings that dwelt around him, to Arioch king of Elasar, and to Tidal king of Goyim, and made a covenant with them, and they were all obedient to his commands.",
        "13:17": "And it was in the fifteenth year of Abram's dwelling in the land of Canaan, which is the seventieth year of the life of Abram, and the Lord appeared to Abram in that year and he said to him, I am the Lord who brought thee out from Ur Casdim to give thee this land for an inheritance.",
        "13:18": "Now therefore walk before me and be perfect and keep my commands, for to thee and to thy seed I will give this land for an inheritance, from the river Mitzraim unto the great river Euphrates.",
        "13:19": "And thou shalt come to thy fathers in peace and in good age, and the fourth generation shall return here in this land and shall inherit it forever; and Abram built an altar, and he called upon the name of the Lord who appeared to him, and he brought up sacrifices upon the altar to the Lord.",
        "13:20": "At that time Abram returned and went to Haran to see his father and mother, and his father's household, and Abram and his wife and all belonging to him returned to Haran, and Abram dwelt in Haran five years.",
        "13:21": "And many of the people of Haran, about seventy-two men, followed Abram and Abram taught them the instruction of the Lord and his ways, and he taught them to know the Lord.",
        "13:22": "In those days the Lord appeared to Abram in Haran, and he said to him, Behold, I spoke unto thee these twenty years back saying,",
        "13:23": "Go forth from thy land, from thy birth-place and from thy father's house, to the land which I have shown thee to give it to thee and to thy children, for there in that land will I bless thee, and make thee a great nation, and make thy name great, and in thee shall the families of the earth be blessed.",
        "13:24": "Now therefore arise, go forth from this place, thou, thy wife, and all belonging to thee, also every one born in thy house and all the souls thou hast made in Haran, and bring them out with thee from here, and rise to return to the land of Canaan.",
        "13:25": "And Abram arose and took his wife Sarai and all belonging to him and all that were born to him in his house and the souls which they had made in Haran, and they came out to go to the land of Canaan.",
        "13:26": "And Abram went and returned to the land of Canaan, according to the word of the Lord. And Lot the son of his brother Haran went with him, and Abram was seventy-five years old when he went forth from Haran to return to the land of Canaan.",
        "13:27": "And he came to the land of Canaan according to the word of the Lord to Abram, and he pitched his tent and he dwelt in the plain of Mamre, and with him was Lot his brother's son, and all belonging to him.",
        "13:28": "And the Lord again appeared to Abram and said, To thy seed will I give this land; and he there built an altar to the Lord who appeared to him, which is still to this day in the plains of Mamre.",
        "14:1": "In those days there was in the land of Shinar a wise man who had understanding in all wisdom, and of a beautiful appearance, but he was poor and indigent; his name was Rikayon and he was hard set to support himself.",
        "14:2": "And he resolved to go to Egypt, to Oswiris the son of Anom king of Egypt, to show the king his wisdom; for perhaps he might find grace in his sight, to raise him up and give him maintenance; and Rikayon did so.",
        "14:3": "And when Rikayon came to Egypt he asked the inhabitants of Egypt concerning the king, and the inhabitants of Egypt told him the custom of the king of Egypt, for it was then the custom of the king of Egypt that he went from his royal palace and was seen abroad only one day in the year, and after that the king would return to his palace to remain there.",
        "14:4": "And on the day when the king went forth he passed judgment in the land, and every one having a suit came before the king that day to obtain his request.",
        "14:5": "And when Rikayon heard of the custom in Egypt and that he could not come into the presence of the king, he grieved greatly and was very sorrowful.",
        "14:6": "And in the evening Rikayon went out and found a house in ruins, formerly a bake house in Egypt, and he abode there all night in bitterness of soul and pinched with hunger, and sleep was removed from his eyes.",
        "14:7": "And Rikayon considered within himself what he should do in the town until the king made his appearance, and how he might maintain himself there.",
        "14:8": "And he rose in the morning and walked about, and met in his way those who sold vegetables and various sorts of seed with which they supplied the inhabitants.",
        "14:9": "And Rikayon wished to do the same in order to get a maintenance in the city, but he was unacquainted with the custom of the people, and he was like a blind man among them.",
        "14:10": "And he went and obtained vegetables to sell them for his support, and the rabble assembled about him and ridiculed him, and took his vegetables from him and left him nothing.",
        "14:11": "And he rose up from there in bitterness of soul, and went sighing to the bake house in which he had remained all the night before, and he slept there the second night.",
        "14:12": "And on that night again he reasoned within himself how he could save himself from starvation, and he devised a scheme how to act.",
        "14:13": "And he rose up in the morning and acted ingeniously, and went and hired thirty strong men of the rabble, carrying their war instruments in their hands, and he led them to the top of the Egyptian sepulchre, and he placed them there.",
        "14:14": "And he commanded them, saying, Thus saith the king, Strengthen yourselves and be valiant men, and let no man be buried here until two hundred pieces of silver be given, and then he may be buried; and those men did according to the order of Rikayon to the people of Egypt the whole of that year.",
        "14:15": "And in eight months time Rikayon and his men gathered great riches of silver and gold, and Rikayon took a great quantity of horses and other animals, and he hired more men, and he gave them horses and they remained with him.",
        "14:16": "And when the year came round, at the time the king went forth into the town, all the inhabitants of Egypt assembled together to speak to him concerning the work of Rikayon and his men.",
        "14:17": "And the king went forth on the appointed day, and all the Egyptians came before him and cried unto him, saying,",
        "14:18": "May the king live forever. What is this thing thou doest in the town to thy servants, not to suffer a dead body to be buried until so much silver and gold be given? Was there ever the like unto this done in the whole earth, from the days of former kings yea even from the days of Adam, unto this day, that the dead should not be buried only for a set price?",
        "14:19": "We know it to be the custom of kings to take a yearly tax from the living, but thou dost not only do this, but from the dead also thou exactest a tax day by day.",
        "14:20": "Now, O king, we can no more bear this, for the whole city is ruined on this account, and dost thou not know it?",
        "14:21": "And when the king heard all that they had spoken he was very wroth, and his anger burned within him at this affair, for he had known nothing of it.",
        "14:22": "And the king said, Who and where is he that dares to do this wicked thing in my land without my command? Surely you will tell me.",
        "14:23": "And they told him all the works of Rikayon and his men, and the king's anger was aroused, and he ordered Rikayon and his men to be brought before him.",
        "14:24": "And Rikayon took about a thousand children, sons and daughters, and clothed them in silk and embroidery, and he set them upon horses and sent them to the king by means of his men, and he also took a great quantity of silver and gold and precious stones, and a strong and beautiful horse, as a present for the king, with which he came before the king and bowed down to the earth before him; and the king, his servants and all the inhabitants of Egypt wondered at the work of Rikayon, and they saw his riches and the present that he had brought to the king.",
        "14:25": "And it greatly pleased the king and he wondered at it; and when Rikayon sat before him the king asked him concerning all his works, and Rikayon spoke all his words wisely before the king, his servants and all the inhabitants of Egypt.",
        "14:26": "And when the king heard the words of Rikayon and his wisdom, Rikayon found grace in his sight, and he met with grace and kindness from all the servants of the king and from all the inhabitants of Egypt, on account of his wisdom and excellent speeches, and from that time they loved him exceedingly.",
        "14:27": "And the king answered and said to Rikayon, Thy name shall no more be called Rikayon but Pharaoh shall be thy name, since thou didst exact a tax from the dead; and he called his name Pharaoh.",
        "14:28": "And the king and his subjects loved Rikayon for his wisdom, and they consulted with all the inhabitants of Egypt to make him prefect under the king.",
        "14:29": "And all the inhabitants of Egypt and its wise men did so, and it was made a law in Egypt.",
        "14:30": "And they made Rikayon Pharaoh prefect under Oswiris king of Egypt, and Rikayon Pharaoh governed over Egypt, daily administering justice to the whole city, but Oswiris the king would judge the people of the land one day in the year, when he went out to make his appearance.",
        "14:31": "And Rikayon Pharaoh cunningly usurped the government of Egypt, and he exacted a tax from all the inhabitants of Egypt.",
        "14:32": "And all the inhabitants of Egypt greatly loved Rikayon Pharaoh, and they made a decree to call every king that should reign over them and their seed in Egypt, Pharaoh.",
        "14:33": "Therefore all the kings that reigned in Egypt from that time forward were called Pharaoh unto this day.",
        "15:1": "And in that year there was a heavy famine throughout the land of Canaan, and the inhabitants of the land could not remain on account of the famine for it was very grievous.",
        "15:2": "And Abram and all belonging to him rose and went down to Egypt on account of the famine, and when they were at the brook Mitzraim they remained there some time to rest from the fatigue of the road.",
        "15:3": "And Abram and Sarai were walking at the border of the brook Mitzraim, and Abram beheld his wife Sarai that she was very beautiful.",
        "15:4": "And Abram said to his wife Sarai, Since God has created thee with such a beautiful countenance, I am afraid of the Egyptians lest they should slay me and take thee away, for the fear of God is not in these places.",
        "15:5": "Surely then thou shalt do this, Say thou art my sister to all that may ask thee, in order that it may be well with me, and that we may live and not be put to death.",
        "15:6": "And Abram commanded the same to all those that came with him to Egypt on account of the famine; also his nephew Lot he commanded, saying, If the Egyptians ask thee concerning Sarai say she is the sister of Abram.",
        "15:7": "And yet with all these orders Abram did not put confidence in them, but he took Sarai and placed her in a chest and concealed it amongst their vessels, for Abram was greatly concerned about Sarai on account of the wickedness of the Egyptians.",
        "15:8": "And Abram and all belonging to him rose up from the brook Mitzraim and came to Egypt; and they had scarcely entered the gates of the city when the guards stood up to them saying, Give tithe to the king from what you have, and then you may come into the town; and Abram and those that were with him did so.",
        "15:9": "And Abram with the people that were with him came to Egypt, and when they came they brought the chest in which Sarai was concealed and the Egyptians saw the chest.",
        "15:10": "And the king's servants approached Abram, saying, What hast thou here in this chest which we have not seen? Now open thou the chest and give tithe to the king of all that it contains.",
        "15:11": "And Abram said, This chest I will not open, but all you demand upon it I will give. And Pharaoh's officers answered Abram, saying, It is a chest of precious stones, give us the tenth thereof.",
        "15:12": "Abram said, All that you desire I will give, but you must not open the chest.",
        "15:13": "And the king's officers pressed Abram, and they reached the chest and opened it with force, and they saw, and behold a beautiful woman was in the chest.",
        "15:14": "And when the officers of the king beheld Sarai they were struck with admiration at her beauty, and all the princes and servants of Pharaoh assembled to see Sarai, for she was very beautiful. And the king's officers ran and told Pharaoh all that they had seen, and they praised Sarai to the king; and Pharaoh ordered her to be brought, and the woman came before the king.",
        "15:15": "And Pharaoh beheld Sarai and she pleased him exceedingly, and he was struck with her beauty, and the king rejoiced greatly on her account, and made presents to those who brought him the tidings concerning her.",
        "15:16": "And the woman was then brought to Pharaoh's house, and Abram grieved on account of his wife, and he prayed to the Lord to deliver her from the hands of Pharaoh.",
        "15:17": "And Sarai also prayed at that time and said, O Lord God thou didst tell my Lord Abram to go from his land and from his father's house to the land of Canaan, and thou didst promise to do well with him if he would perform thy commands; now behold we have done that which thou didst command us, and we left our land and our families, and we went to a strange land and to a people whom we have not known before.",
        "15:18": "And we came to this land to avoid the famine, and this evil accident has befallen me; now therefore, O Lord God, deliver us and save us from the hand of this oppressor, and do well with me for the sake of thy mercy.",
        "15:19": "And the Lord hearkened to the voice of Sarai, and the Lord sent an angel to deliver Sarai from the power of Pharaoh.",
        "15:20": "And the king came and sat before Sarai and behold an angel of the Lord was standing over them, and he appeared to Sarai and said to her, Do not fear, for the Lord has heard thy prayer.",
        "15:21": "And the king approached Sarai and said to her, What is that man to thee who brought thee hither? and she said, He is my brother.",
        "15:22": "And the king said, It is incumbent upon us to make him great, to elevate him and to do unto him all the good which thou shalt command us; and at that time the king sent to Abram silver and gold and precious stones in abundance, together with cattle, men servants and maid servants; and the king ordered Abram to be brought, and he sat in the court of the king's house, and the king greatly exalted Abram on that night.",
        "15:23": "And the king approached to speak to Sarai, and he reached out his hand to touch her, when the angel smote him heavily, and he was terrified and he refrained from reaching to her.",
        "15:24": "And when the king came near to Sarai, the angel smote him to the ground, and acted thus to him the whole night, and the king was terrified.",
        "15:25": "And the angel on that night smote heavily all the servants of the king, and his whole household, on account of Sarai, and there was a great lamentation that night amongst the people of Pharaoh's house.",
        "15:26": "And Pharaoh, seeing the evil that befell him, said, Surely on account of this woman has this thing happened to me, and he removed himself at some distance from her and spoke pleasing words to her.",
        "15:27": "And the king said to Sarai, Tell me I pray thee concerning the man with whom thou camest here; and Sarai said, This man is my husband, and I said to thee that he was my brother for I was afraid, lest thou shouldst put him to death through wickedness.",
        "15:28": "And the king kept away from Sarai, and the plagues of the angel of the Lord ceased from him and his household; and Pharaoh knew that he was smitten on account of Sarai, and the king was greatly astonished at this.",
        "15:29": "And in the morning the king called for Abram and said to him, What is this thou hast done to me? Why didst thou say, She is my sister, owing to which I took her unto me for a wife, and this heavy plague has therefore come upon me and my household.",
        "15:30": "Now therefore here is thy wife, take her and go from our land lest we all die on her account. And Pharaoh took more cattle, men servants and maid servants, and silver and gold, to give to Abram, and he returned unto him Sarai his wife.",
        "15:31": "And the king took a maiden whom he begat by his concubines, and he gave her to Sarai for a handmaid.",
        "15:32": "And the king said to his daughter, It is better for thee my daughter to be a handmaid in this man's house than to be mistress in my house, after we have beheld the evil that befell us on account of this woman.",
        "15:33": "And Abram arose, and he and all belonging to him went away from Egypt; and Pharaoh ordered some of his men to accompany him and all that went with him.",
        "15:34": "And Abram returned to the land of Canaan, to the place where he had made the altar, where he at first had pitched his tent.",
        "15:35": "And Lot the son of Haran, Abram's brother, had a heavy stock of cattle, flocks and herds and tents, for the Lord was bountiful to them on account of Abram.",
        "15:36": "And when Abram was dwelling in the land the herdsmen of Lot quarrelled with the herdsmen of Abram, for their property was too great for them to remain together in the land, and the land could not bear them on account of their cattle.",
        "15:37": "And when Abram's herdsmen went to feed their flock they would not go into the fields of the people of the land, but the cattle of Lot's herdsmen did otherwise, for they were suffered to feed in the fields of the people of the land.",
        "15:38": "And the people of the land saw this occurrence daily, and they came to Abram and quarrelled with him on account of Lot's herdsmen.",
        "15:39": "And Abram said to Lot, What is this thou art doing to me, to make me despicable to the inhabitants of the land, that thou orderest thy herdsman to feed thy cattle in the fields of other people? Dost thou not know that I am a stranger in this land amongst the children of Canaan, and why wilt thou do this unto me?",
        "15:40": "And Abram quarrelled daily with Lot on account of this, but Lot would not listen to Abram, and he continued to do the same and the inhabitants of the land came and told Abram.",
        "15:41": "And Abram said unto Lot, How long wilt thou be to me for a stumbling block with the inhabitants of the land? Now I beseech thee let there be no more quarrelling between us, for we are kinsmen.",
        "15:42": "But I pray thee separate from me, go and choose a place where thou mayest dwell with thy cattle and all belonging to thee, but Keep thyself at a distance from me, thou and thy household.",
        "15:43": "And be not afraid in going from me, for if any one do an injury to thee, let me know and I will avenge thy cause from him, only remove from me.",
        "15:44": "And when Abram had spoken all these words to Lot, then Lot arose and lifted up his eyes toward the plain of Jordan.",
        "15:45": "And he saw that the whole of this place was well watered, and good for man as well as affording pasture for the cattle.",
        "15:46": "And Lot went from Abram to that place, and he there pitched his tent and he dwelt in Sodom, and they were separated from each other.",
        "15:47": "And Abram dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and he pitched his tent there, and Abram remained in that place many years.",
        "16:1": "At that time Chedorlaomer king of Elam sent to all the neighboring kings, to Nimrod, king of Shinar who was then under his power, and to Tidal, king of Goyim, and to Arioch, king of Elasar, with whom he made a covenant, saying, Come up to me and assist me, that we may smite all the towns of Sodom and its inhabitants, for they have rebelled against me these thirteen years.",
        "16:2": "And these four kings went up with all their camps, about eight hundred thousand men, and they went as they were, and smote every man they found in their road.",
        "16:3": "And the five kings of Sodom and Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboyim, Bera king of Sodom, Bersha king of Gomorrah, and Bela king of Zoar, went out to meet them, and they all joined together in the valley of Siddim.",
        "16:4": "And these nine kings made war in the valley of Siddim; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah were smitten before the kings of Elam.",
        "16:5": "And the valley of Siddim was full of lime pits and the kings of Elam pursued the kings of Sodom, and the kings of Sodom with their camps fled and fell into the lime pits, and all that remained went to the mountain for safety, and the five kings of Elam came after them and pursued them to the gates of Sodom, and they took all that there was in Sodom.",
        "16:6": "And they plundered all the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, and they also took Lot, Abram's brother's son, and his property, and they seized all the goods of the cities of Sodom, and they went away; and Unic, Abram's servant, who was in the battle, saw this, and told Abram all that the kings had done to the cities of Sodom, and that Lot was taken captive by them.",
        "16:7": "And Abram heard this, and he rose up with about three hundred and eighteen men that were with him, and he that night pursued these kings and smote them, and they all fell before Abram and his men, and there was none remaining but the four kings who fled, and they went each his own road.",
        "16:8": "And Abram recovered all the property of Sodom, and he also recovered Lot and his property, his wives and little ones and all belonging to him, so that Lot lacked nothing.",
        "16:9": "And when he returned from smiting these kings, he and his men passed the valley of Siddim where the kings had made war together.",
        "16:10": "And Bera king of Sodom, and the rest of his men that were with him, went out from the lime pits into which they had fallen, to meet Abram and his men.",
        "16:11": "And Adonizedek king of Jerusalem, the same was Shem, went out with his men to meet Abram and his people, with bread and wine, and they remained together in the valley of Melech.",
        "16:12": "And Adonizedek blessed Abram, and Abram gave him a tenth from all that he had brought from the spoil of his enemies, for Adonizedek was a priest before God.",
        "16:13": "And all the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah who were there, with their servants, approached Abram and begged of him to return them their servants whom he had made captive, and to take unto himself all the property.",
        "16:14": "And Abram answered the kings of Sodom, saying, As the Lord liveth who created heaven and earth, and who redeemed my soul from all affliction, and who delivered me this day from my enemies, and gave them into my hand, I will not take anything belonging to you, that you may not boast tomorrow, saying, Abram became rich from our property that he saved.",
        "16:15": "For the Lord my God in whom I trust said unto me, Thou shalt lack nothing, for I will bless thee in all the works of thy hands.",
        "16:16": "And now therefore behold, here is all belonging to you, take it and go; as the Lord liveth I will not take from you from a living soul down to a shoetie or thread, excepting the expense of the food of those who went out with me to battle, as also the portions of the men who went with me, Anar, Ashcol, and Mamre, they and their men, as well as those also who had remained to watch the baggage, they shall take their portion of the spoil.",
        "16:17": "And the kings of Sodom gave Abram according to all that he had said, and they pressed him to take of whatever he chose, but he would not.",
        "16:18": "And he sent away the kings of Sodom and the remainder of their men, and he gave them orders about Lot, and they went to their respective places.",
        "16:19": "And Lot, his brother's son, he also sent away with his property, and he went with them, and Lot returned to his home, to Sodom, and Abram and his people returned to their home to the plains of Mamre, which is in Hebron.",
        "16:20": "At that time the Lord again appeared to Abram in Hebron, and he said to him, Do not fear, thy reward is very great before me, for I will not leave thee, until I shall have multiplied thee, and blessed thee and made thy seed like the stars in heaven, which cannot be measured nor numbered.",
        "16:21": "And I will give unto thy seed all these lands that thou seest with thine eyes, to them will I give them for an inheritance forever, only be strong and do not fear, walk before me and be perfect.",
        "16:22": "And in the seventy-eighth year of the life of Abram, in that year died Reu, the son of Peleg, and all the days of Reu were two hundred and thirty-nine years, and he died.",
        "16:23": "And Sarai, the daughter of Haran, Abram's wife, was still barren in those days; she did not bear to Abram either son or daughter.",
        "16:24": "And when she saw that she bare no children she took her handmaid Hagar, whom Pharaoh had given her, and she gave her to Abram her husband for a wife.",
        "16:25": "For Hagar learned all the ways of Sarai as Sarai taught her, she was not in any way deficient in following her good ways.",
        "16:26": "And Sarai said to Abram, Behold here is my handmaid Hagar, go to her that she may bring forth upon my knees, that I may also obtain children through her.",
        "16:27": "And at the end of ten years of Abram's dwelling in the land of Canaan, which is the eighty-fifth year of Abram's life, Sarai gave Hagar unto him.",
        "16:28": "And Abram hearkened to the voice of his wife Sarai, and he took his handmaid Hagar and Abram came to her and she conceived.",
        "16:29": "And when Hagar saw that she had conceived she rejoiced greatly, and her mistress was despised in her eyes, and she said within herself, This can only be that I am better before God than Sarai my mistress, for all the days that my mistress has been with my lord, she did not conceive, but me the Lord has caused in so short a time to conceive by him.",
        "16:30": "And when Sarai saw that Hagar had conceived by Abram, Sarai was jealous of her handmaid, and Sarai said within herself, This is surely nothing else but that she must be better than I am.",
        "16:31": "And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee, for at the time when thou didst pray before the Lord for children why didst thou not pray on my account, that the Lord should give me seed from thee?",
        "16:32": "And when I speak to Hagar in thy presence, she despiseth my words, because she has conceived, and thou wilt say nothing to her; may the Lord judge between me and thee for what thou hast done to me.",
        "16:33": "And Abram said to Sarai, Behold thy handmaid is in thy hand, do unto her as it may seem good in thy eyes; and Sarai afflicted her, and Hagar fled from her to the wilderness.",
        "16:34": "And an angel of the Lord found her in the place where she had fled, by a well, and he said to her, Do not fear, for I will multiply thy seed, for thou shalt bear a son and thou shalt call his name Ishmael; now then return to Sarai thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.",
        "16:35": "And Hagar called the place of that well Beer-lahai-roi, it is between Kadesh and the wilderness of Bered.",
        "16:36": "And Hagar at that time returned to her master's house, and at the end of days Hagar bare a son to Abram, and Abram called his name Ishmael; and Abram was eighty-six years old when he begat him.",
        "17:1": "And in those days, in the ninety-first year of the life of Abram, the children of Chittim made war with the children of Tubal, for when the Lord had scattered the sons of men upon the face of the earth, the children of Chittim went and embodied themselves in the plain of Canopia, and they built themselves cities there and dwelt by the river Tibreu.",
        "17:2": "And the children of Tubal dwelt in Tuscanah, and their boundaries reached the river Tibreu, and the children of Tubal built a city in Tuscanan, and they called the name Sabinah, after the name of Sabinah son of Tubal their father, and they dwelt there unto this day.",
        "17:3": "And it was at that time the children of Chittim made war with the children of Tubal, and the children of Tubal were smitten before the children of Chittim, and the children of Chittim caused three hundred and seventy men to fall from the children of Tubal.",
        "17:4": "And at that time the children of Tubal swore to the children of Chittim, saying, You shall not intermarry amongst us, and no man shall give his daughter to any of the sons of Chittim.",
        "17:5": "For all the daughters of Tubal were in those days fair, for no women were then found in the whole earth so fair as the daughters of Tubal.",
        "17:6": "And all who delighted in the beauty of women went to the daughters of Tubal and took wives from them, and the sons of men, kings and princes, who greatly delighted in the beauty of women, took wives in those days from the daughters of Tubal.",
        "17:7": "And at the end of three years after the children of Tubal had sworn to the children of Chittim not to give them their daughters for wives, about twenty men of the children of Chittim went to take some of the daughters of Tubal, but they found none.",
        "17:8": "For the children of Tubal kept their oaths not to intermarry with them, and they would not break their oaths.",
        "17:9": "And in the days of harvest the children of Tubal went into their fields to get in their harvest, when the young men of Chittim assembled and went to the city of Sabinah, and each man took a young woman from the daughters of Tubal, and they came to their cities.",
        "17:10": "And the children of Tubal heard of it and they went to make war with them, and they could not prevail over them, for the mountain was exceedingly high from them, and when they saw they could not prevail over them they returned to their land.",
        "17:11": "And at the revolution of the year the children of Tubal went and hired about ten thousand men from those cities that were near them, and they went to war with the children of Chittim.",
        "17:12": "And the children of Tubal went to war with the children of Chittim, to destroy their land and to distress them, and in this engagement the children of Tubal prevailed over the children of Chittim, and the children of Chittim, seeing that they were greatly distressed, lifted up the children which they had had by the daughters of Tubal, upon the wall which had been built, to be before the eyes of the children of Tubal.",
        "17:13": "And the children of Chittim said to them, Have you come to make war with your own sons and daughters, and have we not been considered your flesh and bones from that time till now?",
        "17:14": "And when the children of Tubal heard this they ceased to make war with the children of Chittim, and they went away.",
        "17:15": "And they returned to their cities, and the children of Chittim at that time assembled and built two cities by the sea, and they called one Purtu and the other Ariza.",
        "17:16": "And Abram the son of Terah was then ninety-nine years old.",
        "17:17": "At that time the Lord appeared to him and he said to him, I will make my covenant between me and thee, and I will greatly multiply thy seed, and this is the covenant which I make between me and thee, that every male child be circumcised, thou and thy seed after thee.",
        "17:18": "At eight days old shall it be circumcised, and this covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.",
        "17:19": "And now therefore thy name shall no more be called Abram but Abraham, and thy wife shall no more be called Sarai but Sarah.",
        "17:20": "For I will bless you both, and I will multiply your seed after you that you shall become a great nation, and kings shall come forth from you.",
        "18:1": "And Abraham rose and did all that God had ordered him, and he took the men of his household and those bought with his money, and he circumcised them as the Lord had commanded him.",
        "18:2": "And there was not one left whom he did not circumcise, and Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised in the flesh of their foreskin; thirteen years old was Ishmael when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.",
        "18:3": "And in the third day Abraham went out of his tent and sat at the door to enjoy the heat of the sun, during the pain of his flesh.",
        "18:4": "And the Lord appeared to him in the plain of Mamre, and sent three of his ministering angels to visit him, and he was sitting at the door of the tent, and he lifted his eyes and saw, and lo three men were coming from a distance, and he rose up and ran to meet them, and he bowed down to them and brought them into his house.",
        "18:5": "And he said to them, If now I have found favor in your sight, turn in and eat a morsel of bread; and he pressed them, and they turned in and he gave them water and they washed their feet, and he placed them under a tree at the door of the tent.",
        "18:6": "And Abraham ran and took a calf, tender and good, and he hastened to kill it, and gave it to his servant Eliezer to dress.",
        "18:7": "And Abraham came to Sarah into the tent, and he said to her, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it and make cakes to cover the pot containing the meat, and she did so.",
        "18:8": "And Abraham hastened and brought before them butter and milk, beef and mutton, and gave it before them to eat before the flesh of the calf was sufficiently done, and they did eat.",
        "18:9": "And when they had done eating one of them said to him, I will return to thee according to the time of life, and Sarah thy wife shall have a son.",
        "18:10": "And the men afterward departed and went their ways, to the places to which they were sent.",
        "18:11": "In those days all the people of Sodom and Gomorrah, and of the whole five cities, were exceedingly wicked and sinful against the Lord and they provoked the Lord with their abominations, and they strengthened in aging abominably and scornfully before the Lord, and their wickedness and crimes were in those days great before the Lord.",
        "18:12": "And they had in their land a very extensive valley, about half a day's walk, and in it there were fountains of water and a great deal of herbage surrounding the water.",
        "18:13": "And all the people of Sodom and Gomorrah went there four times in the year, with their wives and children and all belonging to them, and they rejoiced there with timbrels and dances.",
        "18:14": "And in the time of rejoicing they would all rise and lay hold of their neighbor's wives, and some, the virgin daughters of their neighbors, and they enjoyed them, and each man saw his wife and daughter in the hands of his neighbor and did not say a word.",
        "18:15": "And they did so from morning to night, and they afterward returned home each man to his house and each woman to her tent; so they always did four times in the year.",
        "18:16": "Also when a stranger came into their cities and brought goods which he had purchased with a view to dispose of there, the people of these cities would assemble, men, women and children, young and old, and go to the man and take his goods by force, giving a little to each man until there was an end to all the goods of the owner which he had brought into the land.",
        "18:17": "And if the owner of the goods quarreled with them, saying, What is this work which you have done to me, then they would approach to him one by one, and each would show him the little which he took and taunt him, saying, I only took that little which thou didst give me; and when he heard this from them all, he would arise and go from them in sorrow and bitterness of soul, when they would all arise and go after him, and drive him out of the city with great noise and tumult.",
        "18:18": "And there was a man from the country of Elam who was leisurely going on the road, seated upon his ass, which carried a fine mantle of divers colors, and the mantle was bound with a cord upon the ass.",
        "18:19": "And the man was on his journey passing through the street of Sodom when the sun set in the evening, and he remained there in order to abide during the night, but no one would let him into his house; and at that time there was in Sodom a wicked and mischievous man, one skillful to do evil, and his name was Hedad.",
        "18:20": "And he lifted up his eyes and saw the traveler in the street of the city, and he came to him and said, Whence comest thou and whither dost thou go?",
        "18:21": "And the man said to him, I am traveling from Hebron to Elam where I belong, and as I passed the sun set and no one would suffer me to enter his house, though I had bread and water and also straw and provender for my ass, and am short of nothing.",
        "18:22": "And Hedad answered and said to him, All that thou shalt want shall be supplied by me, but in the street thou shalt not abide all night.",
        "18:23": "And Hedad brought him to his house, and he took off the mantle from the ass with the cord, and brought them to his house, and he gave the ass straw and provender whilst the traveler ate and drank in Hedad's house, and he abode there that night.",
        "18:24": "And in the morning the traveler rose up early to continue his journey, when Hedad said to him, Wait, comfort thy heart with a morsel of bread and then go, and the man did so; and he remained with him, and they both ate and drank together during the day, when the man rose up to go.",
        "18:25": "And Hedad said to him, Behold now the day is declining, thou hadst better remain all night that thy heart may be comforted; and he pressed him so that he tarried there all night, and on the second day he rose up early to go away, when Hedad pressed him, saying, Comfort thy heart with a morsel of bread and then go, and he remained and ate with him also the second day, and then the man rose up to continue his journey.",
        "18:26": "And Hedad said to him, Behold now the day is declining, remain with me to comfort thy heart and in the morning rise up early and go thy way.",
        "18:27": "And the man would not remain, but rose and saddled his ass, and whilst he was saddling his ass the wife of Hedad said to her husband, Behold this man has remained with us for two days eating and drinking and he has given us nothing, and now shall he go away from us without giving anything? and Hedad said to her, Be silent.",
        "18:28": "And the man saddled his ass to go, and he asked Hedad to give him the cord and mantle to tie it upon the ass.",
        "18:29": "And Hedad said to him, What sayest thou? And he said to him, That thou my lord shalt give me the cord and the mantle made with divers colors which thou didst conceal with thee in thy house to take care of it.",
        "18:30": "And Hedad answered the man, saying, This is the interpretation of thy dream, the cord which thou didst see, means that thy life will be lengthened out like a cord, and having seen the mantle colored with all sorts of colors, means that thou shalt have a vineyard in which thou wilt plant trees of all fruits.",
        "18:31": "And the traveler answered, saying, Not so my lord, for I was awake when I gave thee the cord and also a mantle woven with different colors, which thou didst take off the ass to put them by for me; and Hedad answered and said, Surely I have told thee the interpretation of thy dream and it is a good dream, and this is the interpretation thereof.",
        "18:32": "Now the sons of men give me four pieces of silver, which is my charge for interpreting dreams, and of thee only I require three pieces of silver.",
        "18:33": "And the man was provoked at the words of Hedad, and he cried bitterly, and he brought Hedad to Serak judge of Sodom.",
        "18:34": "And the man laid his cause before Serak the judge, when Hedad replied, saying, It is not so, but thus the matter stands; and the judge said to the traveler, This man Hedad telleth thee truth, for he is famed in the cities for the accurate interpretation of dreams.",
        "18:35": "And the man cried at the word of the judge, and he said, Not so my Lord, for it was in the day that I gave him the cord and mantle which was upon the ass, in order to put them by in his house; and they both disputed before the judge, the one saying, Thus the matter was, and the other declaring otherwise.",
        "18:36": "And Hedad said to the man, Give me four pieces of silver that I charge for my interpretations of dreams; I will not make any allowance; and give me the expense of the four meals that thou didst eat in my house.",
        "18:37": "And the man said to Hedad, Truly I will pay thee for what I ate in thy house, only give me the cord and mantle which thou didst conceal in thy house.",
        "18:38": "And Hedad replied before the judge and said to the man, Did I not tell thee the interpretation of thy dream? the cord means that thy days shall be prolonged like a cord, and the mantle, that thou wilt have a vineyard in which thou wilt plant all kinds of fruit trees.",
        "18:39": "This is the proper interpretation of thy dream, now give me the four pieces of silver that I require as a compensation, for I will make thee no allowance.",
        "18:40": "And the man cried at the words of Hedad and they both quarreled before the judge, and the judge gave orders to his servants, who drove them rashly from the house.",
        "18:41": "And they went away quarreling from the judge, when the people of Sodom heard them, and they gathered about them and they exclaimed against the stranger, and they drove him rashly from the city.",
        "18:42": "And the man continued his journey upon his ass with bitterness of soul, lamenting and weeping.",
        "18:43": "And whilst he was going along he wept at what had happened to him in the corrupt city of Sodom.",
        "19:1": "And the cities of Sodom had four judges to four cities, and these were their names, Serak in the city of Sodom, Sharkad in Gomorrah, Zabnac in Admah, and Menon in Zeboyim.",
        "19:2": "And Eliezer Abraham's servant applied to them different names, and he converted Serak to Shakra, Sharkad to Shakrura, Zebnac to Kezobim, and Menon to Matzlodin.",
        "19:3": "And by desire of their four judges the people of Sodom and Gomorrah had beds erected in the streets of the cities, and if a man came to these places they laid hold of him and brought him to one of their beds, and by force made him to lie in them.",
        "19:4": "And as he lay down, three men would stand at his head and three at his feet, and measure him by the length of the bed, and if the man was less than the bed these six men would stretch him at each end, and when he cried out to them they would not answer him.",
        "19:5": "And if he was longer than the bed they would draw together the two sides of the bed at each end, until the man had reached the gates of death.",
        "19:6": "And if he continued to cry out to them, they would answer him, saying, Thus shall it be done to a man that cometh into our land.",
        "19:7": "And when men heard all these things that the people of the cities of Sodom did, they refrained from coming there.",
        "19:8": "And when a poor man came to their land they would give him silver and gold, and cause a proclamation in the whole city not to give him a morsel of bread to eat, and if the stranger should remain there some days, and die from hunger, not having been able to obtain a morsel of bread, then at his death all the people of the city would come and take their silver and gold which they had given to him.",
        "19:9": "And those that could recognize the silver or gold which they had given him took it back, and at his death they also stripped him of his garments, and they would fight about them, and he that prevailed over his neighbor took them.",
        "19:10": "They would after that carry him and bury him under some of the shrubs in the deserts; so they did all the days to any one that came to them and died in their land.",
        "19:11": "And in the course of time Sarah sent Eliezer to Sodom, to see Lot and inquire after his welfare.",
        "19:12": "And Eliezer went to Sodom, and he met a man of Sodom fighting with a stranger, and the man of Sodom stripped the poor man of all his clothes and went away.",
        "19:13": "And this poor man cried to Eliezer and supplicated his favor on account of what the man of Sodom had done to him.",
        "19:14": "And he said to him, Why dost thou act thus to the poor man who came to thy land?",
        "19:15": "And the man of Sodom answered Eliezer, saying, Is this man thy brother, or have the people of Sodom made thee a judge this day, that thou speakest about this man?",
        "19:16": "And Eliezer strove with the man of Sodom on account of the poor man, and when Eliezer approached to recover the poor man's clothes from the man of Sodom, he hastened and with a stone smote Eliezer in the forehead.",
        "19:17": "And the blood flowed copiously from Eliezer's forehead, and when the man saw the blood he caught hold of Eliezer, saying, Give me my hire for having rid thee of this bad blood that was in thy forehead, for such is the custom and the law in our land.",
        "19:18": "And Eliezer said to him, Thou hast wounded me and requirest me to pay thee thy hire; and Eliezer would not hearken to the words of the man of Sodom.",
        "19:19": "And the man laid hold of Eliezer and brought him to Shakra the judge of Sodom for judgment.",
        "19:20": "And the man spoke to the judge, saying, I beseech thee my lord, thus has this man done, for I smote him with a stone that the blood flowed from his forehead, and he is unwilling to give me my hire.",
        "19:21": "And the judge said to Eliezer, This man speaketh truth to thee, give him his hire, for this is the custom in our land; and Eliezer heard the words of the judge, and he lifted up a stone and smote the judge, and the stone struck on his forehead, and the blood flowed copiously from the forehead of the judge, and Eliezer said, If this then is the custom in your land give thou unto this man what I should have given him, for this has been thy decision, thou didst decree it.",
        "19:22": "And Eliezer left the man of Sodom with the judge, and he went away.",
        "19:23": "And when the kings of Elam had made war with the kings of Sodom, the kings of Elam captured all the property of Sodom, and they took Lot captive, with his property, and when it was told to Abraham he went and made war with the kings of Elam, and he recovered from their hands all the property of Lot as well as the property of Sodom.",
        "19:24": "At that time the wife of Lot bare him a daughter, and he called her name Paltith, saying, Because God had delivered him and his whole household from the kings of Elam; and Paltith daughter of Lot grew up, and one of the men of Sodom took her for a wife.",
        "19:25": "And a poor man came into the city to seek a maintenance, and he remained in the city some days, and all the people of Sodom caused a proclamation of their custom not to give this man a morsel of bread to eat, until he dropped dead upon the earth, and they did so.",
        "19:26": "And Paltith the daughter of Lot saw this man lying in the streets starved with hunger, and no one would give him any thing to keep him alive, and he was just upon the point of death.",
        "19:27": "And her soul was filled with pity on account of the man, and she fed him secretly with bread for many days, and the soul of this man was revived.",
        "19:28": "For when she went forth to fetch water she would put the bread in the water pitcher, and when she came to the place where the poor man was, she took the bread from the pitcher and gave it him to eat; so she did many days.",
        "19:29": "And all the people of Sodom and Gomorrah wondered how this man could bear starvation for so many days.",
        "19:30": "And they said to each other, This can only be that he eats and drinks, for no man can bear starvation for so many days or live as this man has, without even his countenance changing; and three men concealed themselves in a place where the poor man was stationed, to know who it was that brought him bread to eat.",
        "19:31": "And Paltith daughter of Lot went forth that day to fetch water, and she put bread into her pitcher of water, and she went to draw water by the poor man's place, and she took out the bread from the pitcher and gave it to the poor man and he ate it.",
        "19:32": "And the three men saw what Paltith did to the poor man, and they said to her, It is thou then who hast supported him, and therefore has he not starved, nor changed in appearance nor died like the rest.",
        "19:33": "And the three men went out of the place in which they were concealed, and they seized Paltith and the bread which was in the poor man's hand.",
        "19:34": "And they took Paltith and brought her before their judges, and they said to them, Thus did she do, and it is she who supplied the poor man with bread, therefore did he not die all this time; now therefore declare to us the punishment due to this woman for having transgressed our law.",
        "19:35": "And the people of Sodom and Gomorrah assembled and kindled a fire in the street of the city, and they took the woman and cast her into the fire and she was burned to ashes.",
        "19:36": "And in the city of Admah there was a woman to whom they did the like.",
        "19:37": "For a traveler came into the city of Admah to abide there all night, with the intention of going home in the morning, and he sat opposite the door of the house of the young woman's father, to remain there, as the sun had set when be had reached that place; and the young woman saw him sitting by the door of the house.",
        "19:38": "And he asked her for a drink of water and she said to him, Who art thou? and he said to her, I was this day going on the road, and reached here when the sun set, so I will abide here all night, and in the morning I will arise early and continue my journey.",
        "19:39": "And the young woman went into the house and fetched the man bread and water to eat and drink.",
        "19:40": "And this affair became known to the people of Admah, and they assembled and brought the young woman before the judges, that they should judge her for this act.",
        "19:41": "And the judge said, The judgment of death must pass upon this woman because she transgressed our law, and this therefore is the decision concerning her.",
        "19:42": "And the people of those cities assembled and brought out the young woman, and anointed her with honey from head to foot, as the judge had decreed, and they placed her before a swarm of bees which were then in their hives, and the bees flew upon her and stung her that her whole body was swelled.",
        "19:43": "And the young woman cried out on account of the bees, but no one took notice of her or pitied her, and her cries ascended to heaven.",
        "19:44": "And the Lord was provoked at this and at all the works of the cities of Sodom, for they had abundance of food, and had tranquility amongst them, and still would not sustain the poor and the needy, and in those days their evil doings and sins became great before the Lord.",
        "19:45": "And the Lord sent for two of the angels that had come to Abraham's house, to destroy Sodom and its cities.",
        "19:46": "And the angels rose up from the door of Abraham's tent, after they had eaten and drunk, and they reached Sodom in the evening, and Lot was then sitting in the gate of Sodom, and when he saw them he rose to meet them, and he bowed down to the ground.",
        "19:47": "And he pressed them greatly and brought them into his house, and he gave them victuals which they ate, and they abode all night in his house.",
        "19:48": "And the angels said to Lot, Arise, go forth from this place, thou and all belonging to thee, lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of this city, for the Lord will destroy this place.",
        "19:49": "And the angels laid hold upon the hand of Lot and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hands of his children, and all belonging to him, and they brought him forth and set him without the cities.",
        "19:50": "And they said to Lot, Escape for thy life, and he fled and all belonging to him.",
        "19:51": "Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah and upon all these cities brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.",
        "19:52": "And he overthrew these cities, all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground; and Ado the wife of Lot looked back to see the destruction of the cities, for her compassion was moved on account of her daughters who remained in Sodom, for they did not go with her.",
        "19:53": "And when she looked back she became a pillar of salt, and it is yet in that place unto this day.",
        "19:54": "And the oxen which stood in that place daily licked up the salt to the extremities of their feet, and in the morning it would spring forth afresh, and they again licked it up unto this day.",
        "19:55": "And Lot and two of his daughters that remained with him fled and escaped to the cave of Adullam, and they remained there for some time.",
        "19:56": "And Abraham rose up early in the morning to see what had been done to the cities of Sodom; and he looked and beheld the smoke of the cities going up like the smoke of a furnace.",
        "19:57": "And Lot and his two daughters remained in the cave, and they made their father drink wine, and they lay with him, for they said there was no man upon earth that could raise up seed from them, for they thought that the whole earth was destroyed.",
        "19:58": "And they both lay with their father, and they conceived and bare sons, and the first born called the name of her son Moab, saying, From my father did I conceive him; he is the father of the Moabites unto this day.",
        "19:59": "And the younger also called her son Benami; he is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.",
        "19:60": "And after this Lot and his two daughters went away from there, and he dwelt on the other side of the Jordan with his two daughters and their sons, and the sons of Lot grew up, and they went and took themselves wives from the land of Canaan, and they begat children and they were fruitful and multiplied.",
        "20:1": "And at that time Abraham journeyed from the plain of Mamre, and he went to the land of the Philistines, and he dwelt in Gerar; it was in the twenty-fifth year of Abraham's being in the land of Canaan, and the hundredth year of the life of Abraham, that he came to Gerar in the land of the Philistines.",
        "20:2": "And when they entered the land he said to Sarah his wife, Say thou art my sister, to any one that shall ask thee, in order that we may escape the evil of the inhabitants of the land.",
        "20:3": "And as Abraham was dwelling in the land of the Philistines, the servants of Abimelech, king of the Philistines, saw that Sarah was exceedingly beautiful, and they asked Abraham concerning her, and he said, She is my sister.",
        "20:4": "And the servants of Abimelech went to Abimelech, saying, A man from the land of Canaan is come to dwell in the land, and he has a sister that is exceeding fair.",
        "20:5": "And Abimelech heard the words of his servants who praised Sarah to him, and Abimelech sent his officers, and they brought Sarah to the king.",
        "20:6": "And Sarah came to the house of Abimelech, and the king saw that Sarah was beautiful, and she pleased him exceedingly.",
        "20:7": "And he approached her and said to her, What is that man to thee with whom thou didst come to our land? and Sarah answered and said He is my brother, and we came from the land of Canaan to dwell wherever we could find a place.",
        "20:8": "And Abimelech said to Sarah, Behold my land is before thee, place thy brother in any part of this land that pleases thee, and it will be our duty to exalt and elevate him above all the people of the land since he is thy brother.",
        "20:9": "And Abimelech sent for Abraham, and Abraham came to Abimelech.",
        "20:10": "And Abimelech said to Abraham, Behold I have given orders that thou shalt be honored as thou desirest on account of thy sister Sarah.",
        "20:11": "And Abraham went forth from the king, and the king's present followed him.",
        "20:12": "As at evening time, before men lie down to rest, the king was sitting upon his throne, and a deep sleep fell upon him, and he lay upon the throne and slept till morning.",
        "20:13": "And he dreamed that an angel of the Lord came to him with a drawn sword in his hand, and the angel stood over Abimelech, and wished to slay him with the sword, and the king was terrified in his dream, and said to the angel, In what have I sinned against thee that thou comest to slay me with thy sword?",
        "20:14": "And the angel answered and said to Abimelech, Behold thou diest on account of the woman which thou didst yesternight bring to thy house, for she is a married woman, the wife of Abraham who came to thy house; now therefore return that man his wife, for she is his wife; and shouldst thou not return her, know that thou wilt surely die, thou and all belonging to thee.",
        "20:15": "And on that night there was a great outcry in the land of the Philistines, and the inhabitants of the land saw the figure of a man standing with a drawn sword in his hand, and he smote the inhabitants of the land with the sword, yea he continued to smite them.",
        "20:16": "And the angel of the Lord smote the whole land of the Philistines on that night, and there was a great confusion on that night and on the following morning.",
        "20:17": "And every womb was closed, and all their issues, and the hand of the Lord was upon them on account of Sarah, wife of Abraham, whom Abimelech had taken.",
        "20:18": "And in the morning Abimelech rose with terror and confusion and with a great dread, and he sent and had his servants called in, and he related his dream to them, and the people were greatly afraid.",
        "20:19": "And one man standing amongst the servants of the king answered the king, saying, O sovereign king, restore this woman to her husband, for he is her husband, for the like happened to the king of Egypt when this man came to Egypt.",
        "20:20": "And he said concerning his wife, She is my sister, for such is his manner of doing when he cometh to dwell in the land in which he is a stranger.",
        "20:21": "And Pharaoh sent and took this woman for a wife and the Lord brought upon him grievous plagues until he returned the woman to her husband.",
        "20:22": "Now therefore, O sovereign king, know what happened yesternight to the whole land, for there was a very great consternation and great pain and lamentation, and we know that it was on account of the woman which thou didst take.",
        "20:23": "Now, therefore, restore this woman to her husband, lest it should befall us as it did to Pharaoh king of Egypt and his subjects, and that we may not die; and Abimelech hastened and called and had Sarah called for, and she came before him, and he had Abraham called for, and he came before him.",
        "20:24": "And Abimelech said to them, What is this work you have been doing in saying you are brother and sister, and I took this woman for a wife?",
        "20:25": "And Abraham said, Because I thought I should suffer death on account of my wife; and Abimelech took flocks and herds, and men servants and maid servants, and a thousand pieces of silver, and he gave them to Abraham, and he returned Sarah to him.",
        "20:26": "And Abimelech said to Abraham, Behold the whole land is before thee, dwell in it wherever thou shalt choose.",

        "21:47": "And he spoke these words to me, When Ishmael thy husband cometh home say to him, The nail of the tent which thou hast is very good, do not put it away from the tent.",
        "21:48": "And Ishmael knew that it was his father, and that his wife had honored him, and the Lord blessed Ishmael.",
        "22:1": "And Ishmael then rose up and took his wife and his children and his cattle and all belonging to him, and he journeyed from there and he went to his father in the land of the Philistines.",
        "22:2": "And Abraham related to Ishmael his son the transaction with the first wife that Ishmael took, according to what she did.",
        "22:3": "And Ishmael and his children dwelt with Abraham many days in that land, and Abraham dwelt in the land of the Philistines a long time.",
        "22:4": "And the days increased and reached twenty six years, and after that Abraham with his servants and all belonging to him went from the land of the Philistines and removed to a great distance, and they came near to Hebron, and they remained there, and the servants of Abraham dug wells of water, and Abraham and all belonging to him dwelt by the water, and the servants of Abimelech king of the Philistines heard the report that Abraham's servants had dug wells of water in the borders of the land.",
        "22:5": "And they came and quarreled with the servants of Abraham, and they robbed them of the great well which they had dug.",
        "22:6": "And Abimelech king of the Philistines heard of this affair, and he with Phicol the captain of his host and twenty of his men came to Abraham, and Abimelech spoke to Abraham concerning his servants, and Abraham rebuked Abimelech concerning the well of which his servants had robbed him.",
        "22:7": "And Abimelech said to Abraham, As the Lord liveth who created the whole earth, I did not hear of the act which my servants did unto thy servants until this day.",
        "22:8": "And Abraham took seven ewe lambs and gave them to Abimelech, saying, Take these, I pray thee, from my hands that it may be a testimony for me that I dug this well.",
        "22:9": "And Abimelech took the seven ewe lambs which Abraham had given to him, for he had also given him cattle and herds in abundance, and Abimelech swore to Abraham concerning the well, therefore he called that well Beersheba, for there they both swore concerning it.",
        "22:10": "And they both made a covenant in Beersheba, and Abimelech rose up with Phicol the captain of his host and all his men, and they returned to the land of the Philistines, and Abraham and all belonging to him dwelt in Beersheba and he was in that land a long time.",
        "22:11": "And Abraham planted a large grove in Beersheba, and he made to it four gates facing the four sides of the earth, and he planted a vineyard in it, so that if a traveler came to Abraham he entered any gate which was in his road, and remained there and ate and drank and satisfied himself and then departed.",
        "22:12": "For the house of Abraham was always open to the sons of men that passed and repassed, who came daily to eat and drink in the house of Abraham.",
        "22:13": "And any man who had hunger and came to Abraham's house, Abraham would give him bread that he might eat and drink and be satisfied, and any one that came naked to his house he would clothe with garments as he might choose, and give him silver and gold and make known to him the Lord who had created him in the earth; this did Abraham all his life.",
        "22:14": "And Abraham and his children and all belonging to him dwelt in Beersheba, and he pitched his tent as far as Hebron.",
        "22:15": "And Abraham's brother Nahor and his father and all belonging to them dwelt in Haran, for they did not come with Abraham to the land of Canaan.",
        "22:16": "And children were born to Nahor which Milca the daughter of Haran, and sister to Sarah, Abraham's wife, bare to him.",
        "22:17": "And these are the names of those that were born to him, Uz, Buz, Kemuel, Kesed, Chazo, Pildash, Tidlaf, and Bethuel, being eight sons, these are the children of Milca which she bare to Nahor, Abraham's brother.",

        "22:26": "And the children of Bethuel were Sechar, Laban and their sister Rebecca.",
        "22:27": "These are the families of the children of Nahor, that were born to them in Haran; and Aram the son of Kemuel and Rechob his brother went away from Haran, and they found a valley in the land by the river Euphrates.",
        "22:28": "And they built a city there, and they called the name of the city after the name of Pethor the son of Aram, that is Aram Naherayim unto this day.",
        "22:29": "And the children of Kesed also went to dwell where they could find a place, and they went and they found a valley opposite to the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there.",
        "22:30": "And they there built themselves a city, and they called the name at the city Kesed after the name of their father, that is the land Kasdim unto this day, and the Kasdim dwelt in that land and they were fruitful and multiplied exceedingly.",
        "22:31": "And Terah, father of Nahor and Abraham, went and took another wife in his old age, and her name was Pelilah, and she conceived and bare him a son and he called his name Zoba.",
        "22:32": "And Terah lived twenty-five years after he begat Zoba.",
        "22:33": "And Terah died in that year, that is in the thirty-fifth year of the birth of Isaac son of Abraham.",
        "22:34": "And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years, and he was buried in Haran.",
        "22:35": "And Zoba the son of Terah lived thirty years and he begat Aram, Achlis and Merik.",
        "22:36": "And Aram son of Zoba son of Terah, had three wives and he begat twelve sons and three daughters; and the Lord gave to Aram the son of Zoba, riches and possessions, and abundance of cattle, and flocks and herds, and the man increased greatly.",
        "22:37": "And Aram the son of Zoba and his brother and all his household journeyed from Haran, and they went to dwell where they should find a place, for their property was too great to remain in Haran; for they could not stop in Haran together with their brethren the children of Nahor.",
        "22:38": "And Aram the son of Zoba went with his brethren, and they found a valley at a distance toward the eastern country and they dwelt there.",
        "22:39": "And they also built a city there, and they called the name thereof Aram, after the name of their eldest brother; that is Aram Zoba to this day.",
        "22:40": "And Isaac the son of Abraham was growing up in those days, and Abraham his father taught him the way of the Lord to know the Lord, and the Lord was with him.",
        "22:41": "And when Isaac was thirty-seven years old, Ishmael his brother was going about with him in the tent.",
        "22:42": "And Ishmael boasted of himself to Isaac, saying, I was thirteen years old when the Lord spoke to my father to circumcise us, and I did according to the word of the Lord which he spoke to my father, and I gave my soul unto the Lord, and I did not transgress his word which he commanded my father.",
        "22:43": "And Isaac answered Ishmael, saying, Why dost thou boast to me about this, about a little bit of thy flesh which thou didst take from thy body, concerning which the Lord commanded thee?",
        "22:44": "As the Lord liveth, the God of my father Abraham, if the Lord should say unto my father, Take now thy son Isaac and bring him up an offering before me, I would not refrain but I would joyfully accede to it.",
        "22:45": "And the Lord heard the word that Isaac spoke to Ishmael, and it seemed good in the sight of the Lord, and he thought to try Abraham in this matter.",
        "22:46": "And the day arrived when the sons of God came and placed themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came with the sons of God before the Lord.",
        "22:47": "And the Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? and Satan answered the Lord and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.",
        "22:48": "And the Lord said to Satan, What is thy word to me concerning all the children of the earth? and Satan answered the Lord and said, I have seen all the children of the earth who serve thee and remember thee when they require anything from thee.",

        "22:50": "Hast thou seen Abraham the son of Terah, who at first had no children, and he served thee and erected altars to thee wherever he came, and he brought up offerings upon them, and he proclaimed thy name continually to all the children of the earth.",
        "22:51": "And now that his son Isaac is born to him, he has forsaken thee, he has made a great feast for all the inhabitants of the land, and the Lord he has forgotten.",
        "22:52": "For amidst all that he has done he brought thee no offering; neither burnt offering nor peace offering, neither ox, lamb nor goat of all that he killed on the day that his son was weaned.",
        "22:53": "Even from the time of his son's birth till now, being thirty-seven years, he built no altar before thee, nor brought any offering to thee, for he saw that thou didst give what he requested before thee, and he therefore forsook thee.",
        "22:54": "And the Lord said to Satan, Hast thou thus considered my servant Abraham? for there is none like him upon earth, a perfect and an upright man before me, one that feareth God and avoideth evil; as I live, were I to say unto him, Bring up Isaac thy son before me, he would not withhold him from me, much more if I told him to bring up a burnt offering before me from his flock or herds.",
        "22:55": "And Satan answered the Lord and said, Speak then now unto Abraham as thou hast said, and thou wilt see whether he will not this day transgress and cast aside thy words.",
        "23:1": "At that time the word of the Lord came to Abraham, and he said unto him, Abraham, and he said, Here I am.",
        "23:2": "And he said to him, Take now thy son, thine only son whom thou lovest, even Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which shall be shown to thee, for there wilt thou see a cloud and the glory of the Lord.",
        "23:3": "And Abraham said within himself, How shall I separate my son Isaac from Sarah his mother, in order to bring him up for a burnt offering before the Lord?",
        "23:4": "And Abraham came into the tent, and he sat before Sarah his wife, and he spoke these words to her,",
        "23:5": "My son Isaac is grown up and he has not for some time studied the service of his God, now tomorrow I will go and bring him to Shem, and Eber his son, and there he will learn the ways of the Lord, for they will teach him to know the Lord as well as to know that when he prayeth continually before the Lord, he will answer him, therefore there he will know the way of serving the Lord his God.",
        "23:6": "And Sarah said, Thou hast spoken well, go my lord and do unto him as thou hast said, but remove him not at a great distance from me, neither let him remain there too long, for my soul is bound within his soul.",
        "23:7": "And Abraham said unto Sarah, My daughter, let us pray to the Lord our God that he may do good with us.",
        "23:8": "And Sarah took her son Isaac and he abode all that night with her, and she kissed and embraced him, and gave him instructions till morning.",
        "23:9": "And she said to him, O my son, how can my soul separate itself from thee? And she still kissed him and embraced him, and she gave Abraham instructions concerning him.",
        "23:10": "And Sarah said to Abraham, O my lord, I pray thee take heed of thy son, and place thine eyes over him, for I have no other son nor daughter but him.",
        "23:11": "O forsake him not. If he be hungry give him bread, and if he be thirsty give him water to drink; do not let him go on foot, neither let him sit in the sun.",
        "23:12": "Neither let him go by himself in the road, neither force him from whatever he may desire, but do unto him as he may say to thee.",
        "23:13": "And Sarah wept bitterly the whole night on account of Isaac, and she gave him instructions till morning.",
        "23:14": "And in the morning Sarah selected a very fine and beautiful garment from those garments which she had in the house, that Abimelech had given to her.",
        "23:15": "And she dressed Isaac her son therewith, and she put a turban upon his head, and she enclosed a precious stone in the top of the turban, and she gave them provision for the road, and they went forth, and Isaac went with his father Abraham, and some of their servants accompanied them to see them off the road.",
        "23:16": "And Sarah went out with them, and she accompanied them upon the road to see them off, and they said to her, Return to the tent.",
        "23:17": "And when Sarah heard the words of her son Isaac she wept bitterly, and Abraham her husband wept with her, and their son wept with them a great weeping; also those who went with them wept greatly.",
        "23:18": "And Sarah caught hold of her son Isaac, and she held him in her arms, and she embraced him and continued to weep with him, and Sarah said, Who knoweth if after this day I shall ever see thee again?",
        "23:19": "And they still wept together, Abraham, Sarah and Isaac, and all those that accompanied them on the road wept with them, and Sarah afterward turned away from her son, weeping bitterly, and all her men servants and maid servants returned with her to the tent.",
        "23:20": "And Abraham went with Isaac his son to bring him up as an offering before the Lord, as He had commanded him.",
        "23:21": "And Abraham took two of his young men with him, Ishmael the son of Hagar and Eliezer his servant, and they went together with them, and whilst they were walking in the road the young men spoke these words to themselves,",
        "23:22": "And Ishmael said to Eliezer, Now my father Abraham is going with Isaac to bring him up for a burnt offering to the Lord, as He commanded him.",
        "23:23": "Now when he returneth he will give unto me all that he possesses, to inherit after him, for I am his first born.",
        "23:24": "And Eliezer answered Ishmael and said, Surely Abraham did cast thee away with thy mother, and swear that thou shouldst not inherit any thing of all he possesses, and to whom will he give all that he has, with all his treasures, but unto me his servant, who has been faithful in his house, who has served him night and day, and has done all that he desired me? to me will he bequeath at his death all that he possesses.",
        "23:25": "And whilst Abraham was proceeding with his son Isaac along the road, Satan came and appeared to Abraham in the figure of a very aged man, humble and of contrite spirit, and he approached Abraham and said to him, Art thou silly or brutish, that thou goest to do this thing this day to thine only son?",
        "23:26": "For God gave thee a son in thy latter days, in thy old age, and wilt thou go and slaughter him this day because he committed no violence, and wilt thou cause the soul of thine only son to perish from the earth?",
        "23:27": "Dost thou not know and understand that this thing cannot be from the Lord? for the Lord cannot do unto man such evil upon earth to say to him, Go slaughter thy child.",
        "23:28": "And Abraham heard this and knew that it was the word of Satan who endeavored to draw him aside from the way of the Lord, but Abraham would not hearken to the voice of Satan, and Abraham rebuked him so that he went away.",
        "23:29": "And Satan returned and came to Isaac; and he appeared unto Isaac in the figure of a young man comely and well favored.",
        "23:30": "And he approached Isaac and said unto him, Dost thou not know and understand that thy old silly father bringeth thee to the slaughter this day for naught?",
        "23:31": "Now therefore, my son, do not listen nor attend to him, for he is a silly old man, and let not thy precious soul and beautiful figure be lost from the earth.",
        "23:32": "And Isaac heard this, and said unto Abraham, Hast thou heard, my father, that which this man has spoken? even thus has he spoken.",
        "23:33": "And Abraham answered his son Isaac and said to him, Take heed of him and do not listen to his words, nor attend to him, for he is Satan, endeavoring to draw us aside this day from the commands of God.",
        "23:34": "And Abraham still rebuked Satan, and Satan went from them, and seeing he could not prevail over them he hid himself from them, and he went and passed before them in the road; and he transformed himself to a large brook of water in the road, and Abraham and Isaac and his two young men reached that place, and they saw a brook large and powerful as the mighty waters.",
        "23:35": "And they entered the brook and passed through it, and the waters at first reached their legs.",
        "23:36": "And they went deeper in the brook and the waters reached up to their necks, and they were all terrified on account of the water; and whilst they were going over the brook Abraham recognized that place, and he knew that there was no water there before.",
        "23:37": "And Abraham said to his son Isaac, I know this place in which there was no brook nor water, now therefore it is this Satan who does all this to us, to draw us aside this day from the commands of God.",
        "23:38": "And Abraham rebuked him and said unto him, The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan, begone from us for we go by the commands of God.",
        "23:39": "And Satan was terrified at the voice of Abraham, and he went away from them, and the place again became dry land as it was at first.",
        "23:40": "And Abraham went with Isaac toward the place that God had told him.",
        "23:41": "And on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place at a distance which God had told him of.",
        "23:42": "And a pillar of fire appeared to him that reached from the earth to heaven, and a cloud of glory upon the mountain, and the glory of the Lord was seen in the cloud.",
        "23:43": "And Abraham said to Isaac, My son, dost thou see in that mountain, which we perceive at a distance, that which I see upon it?",
        "23:44": "And Isaac answered and said unto his father, I see and lo a pillar of fire and a cloud, and the glory of the Lord is seen upon the cloud.",
        "23:45": "And Abraham knew that his son Isaac was accepted before the Lord for a burnt offering.",
        "23:46": "And Abraham said unto Eliezer and unto Ishmael his son, Do you also see that which we see upon the mountain which is at a distance?",
        "23:47": "And they answered and said, We see nothing more than like the other mountains of the earth. And Abraham knew that they were not accepted before the Lord to go with them, and Abraham said to them, Abide ye here with the ass whilst I and Isaac my son will go to yonder mount and worship there before the Lord and then return to you.",
        "23:48": "And Eliezer and Ishmael remained in that place, as Abraham had commanded.",
        "23:49": "And Abraham took wood for a burnt offering and placed it upon his son Isaac, and he took the fire and the knife, and they both went to that place.",
        "23:50": "And when they were going along Isaac said to his father, Behold, I see here the fire and wood, and where then is the lamb that is to be the burnt offering before the Lord?",
        "23:51": "And Abraham answered his son Isaac, saying, The Lord has made choice of thee my son, to be a perfect burnt offering instead of the lamb.",
        "23:52": "And Isaac said unto his father, I will do all that the Lord spoke to thee with joy and cheerfulness of heart.",
        "23:53": "And Abraham again said unto Isaac his son, Is there in thy heart any thought or counsel concerning this, which is not proper? tell me my son, I pray thee, O my son conceal it not from me.",
        "23:54": "And Isaac answered his father Abraham and said unto him, O my father, as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth, there is nothing in my heart to cause me to deviate either to the right or to the left from the word that he has spoken to thee.",
        "23:55": "Neither limb nor muscle has moved or stirred at this, nor is there in my heart any thought or evil counsel concerning this.",
        "23:56": "But I am of joyful and cheerful heart in this matter, and I say, Blessed is the Lord who has this day chosen me to be a burnt offering before Him.",
        "23:57": "And Abraham greatly rejoiced at the words of Isaac, and they went on and came together to that place that the Lord had spoken of.",
        "23:58": "And Abraham approached to build the altar in that place, and Abraham was weeping, and Isaac took stones and mortar until they had finished building the altar.",
        "23:59": "And Abraham took the wood and placed it in order upon the altar which he had built.",
        "23:60": "And he took his son Isaac and bound him in order to place him upon the wood which was upon the altar, to slay him for a burnt offering before the Lord.",
        "23:61": "And Isaac said to his father, Bind me securely and then place me upon the altar lest I should turn and move, and break loose from the force of the knife upon my flesh and thereof profane the burnt offering; and Abraham did so.",
        "23:62": "And Isaac still said to his father, O my father, when thou shalt have slain me and burnt me for an offering, take with thee that which shall remain of my ashes to bring to Sarah my mother, and say to her, This is the sweet smelling savor of Isaac; but do not tell her this if she should sit near a well or upon any high place, lest she should cast her soul after me and die.",
        "23:63": "And Abraham heard the words of Isaac, and he lifted up his voice and wept when Isaac spake these words; and Abraham's tears gushed down upon Isaac his son, and Isaac wept bitterly, and he said to his father, Hasten thou, O my father, and do with me the will of the Lord our God as He has commanded thee.",
        "23:64": "And the hearts of Abraham and Isaac rejoiced at this thing which the Lord had commanded them; but the eye wept bitterly whilst the heart rejoiced.",
        "23:65": "And Abraham bound his son Isaac, and placed him on the altar upon the wood, and Isaac stretched forth his neck upon the altar before his father, and Abraham stretched forth his hand to take the knife to slay his son as a burnt offering before the Lord.",
        "23:66": "At that time the angels of mercy came before the Lord and spake to him concerning Isaac, saying,",
        "23:67": "0 Lord, thou art a merciful and compassionate King over all that thou hast created in heaven and in earth, and thou supportest them all; give therefore ransom and redemption instead of thy servant Isaac, and pity and have compassion upon Abraham and Isaac his son, who are this day performing thy commands.",
        "23:68": "Hast thou seen, O Lord, how Isaac the son of Abraham thy servant is bound down to the slaughter like an animal? now therefore let thy pity be roused for them, O Lord.",
        "23:69": "At that time the Lord appeared unto Abraham, and called to him, from heaven, and said unto him, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him, for now I know that thou fearest God in performing this act, and in not withholding thy son, thine only son, from me.",
        "23:70": "And Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, a ram was caught in a thicket by his horns; that was the ram which the Lord God had created in the earth in the day that he made earth and heaven.",
        "23:71": "For the Lord had prepared this ram from that day, to be a burnt offering instead of Isaac.",
        "23:72": "And this ram was advancing to Abraham when Satan caught hold of him and entangled his horns in the thicket, that he might not advance to Abraham, in order that Abraham might slay his son.",
        "23:73": "And Abraham, seeing the ram advancing to him and Satan withholding him, fetched him and brought him before the altar, and he loosened his son Isaac from his binding, and he put the ram in his stead, and Abraham killed the ram upon the altar, and brought it up as an offering in the place of his son Isaac.",
        "23:74": "And Abraham sprinkled some of the blood of the ram upon the altar, and he exclaimed and said, This is in the place of my son, and may this be considered this day as the blood of my son before the Lord.",
        "23:75": "And all that Abraham did on this occasion by the altar, he would exclaim and say, This is in the room of my son, and may it this day be considered before the Lord in the place of my son; and Abraham finished the whole of the service by the altar, and the service was accepted before the Lord, and was accounted as if it had been Isaac; and the Lord blessed Abraham and his seed on that day.",
        "23:76": "And Satan went to Sarah, and he appeared to her in the figure of an old man very humble and meek, and Abraham was yet engaged in the burnt offering before the Lord.",
        "23:77": "And he said unto her, Dost thou not know all the work that Abraham has made with thine only son this day? for he took Isaac and built an altar, and killed him, and brought him up as a sacrifice upon the altar, and Isaac cried and wept before his father, but he looked not at him, neither did he have compassion over him.",
        "23:78": "And Satan repeated these words, and he went away from her, and Sarah heard all the words of Satan, and she imagined him to be an old man from amongst the sons of men who had been with her son, and had come and told her these things.",
        "23:79": "And Sarah lifted up her voice and wept and cried out bitterly on account of her son; and she threw herself upon the ground and she cast dust upon her head, and she said, O my son, Isaac my son, O that I had this day died instead of thee. And she continued to weep and said, It grieves me for thee, O my son, my son Isaac, O that I had died this day in thy stead.",
        "23:80": "And she still continued to weep, and said, It grieves me for thee after that I have reared thee and have brought thee up; now my joy is turned into mourning over thee, I that had a longing for thee, and cried and prayed to God till I bare thee at ninety years old; and now hast thou served this day for the knife and the fire, to be made an offering.",
        "23:81": "But I console myself with thee, my son, in its being the word of the Lord, for thou didst perform the command of thy God; for who can transgress the word of our God, in whose hands is the soul of every living creature?",

        "27:10": "And when Esau saw the mighty men of Nimrod coming at a distance, he fled, and thereby escaped; and Esau took the valuable garments of Nimrod, which Nimrod's father had bequeathed to Nimrod, and with which Nimrod prevailed over the whole land, and he ran and concealed them in his house.",
        "27:11": "And Esau took those garments and ran into the city on account of Nimrod's men, and he came unto his father's house wearied and exhausted from fight, and he was ready to die through grief when he approached his brother Jacob and sat before him.",

        "28:7": "And when Isaac had remained three months in the land, Abimelech looked out at the window, and he saw, and behold Isaac was sporting with Rebecca his wife, for Isaac dwelt in the outer house belonging to the king, so that the house of Isaac was opposite the house of the king.",
        "28:8": "And the king said unto Isaac, What is this thou hast done to us in saying of thy wife, She is my sister? how easily might one of the great men of the people have lain with her, and thou wouldst then have brought guilt upon us.",
        "28:9": "And Isaac said unto Abimelech, Because I was afraid lest I die on account of my wife, therefore I said, She is my sister.",
        "28:10": "At that time Abimelech gave orders to all his princes and great men, and they took Isaac and Rebecca his wife and brought them before the king.",
        "28:11": "And the king commanded that they should dress them in princely garments, and make them ride through the streets of the city, and proclaim before them throughout the land, saying, This is the man and this is his wife; whoever toucheth this man or his wife shall surely die.

        "28:14": "And Isaac sowed in that land, and received a hundred-fold in the same year, and the Lord blessed him.",
        "28:15": "And the man waxed great, and he had possession of flocks and possession of herds and great store of servants.",
        "28:16": "And when the days of the famine had passed away the Lord appeared to Isaac and said unto him, Rise up, go forth from this place and return to thy land, to the land of Canaan; and Isaac rose up and returned to Hebron which is in the land of Canaan, he and all belonging to him as the Lord commanded him.",
        "28:17": "And after this Shelach the son at Arpachshad died in that year, which is the eighteenth year of the lives of Jacob and Esau; and all the days that Shelach lived were four hundred and thirty-three years and he died.",
        "28:18": "At that time Isaac sent his younger son Jacob to the house of Shem and Eber, and he learned the instructions of the Lord, and Jacob remained in the house of Shem and Eber for thirty-two years, and Esau his brother did not go, for he was not willing to go, and he remained in his father's house in the land of Canaan.",

        "28:20": "And Esau was a designing and deceitful man, one who hunted after the hearts of men and inveigled them, and Esau was a valiant man in the field, and in the course of time went as usual to hunt; and he came as far as the field of Seir, the same is Edom.",
        "28:21": "And he remained in the land of Seir hunting in the field a year and four months.",
        "28:22": "And Esau there saw in the land of Seir the daughter of a man of Canaan, and her name was Jehudith, the daughter of Beeri, son of Epher, from the families of Heth the son of Canaan.",
        "28:23": "And Esau took her for a wife, and he came unto her; forty years old was Esau when he took her, and he brought her to Hebron, the land of his father's dwelling place, and he dwelt there.",
        "28:24": "And it came to pass in those days, in the hundred and tenth year of the life of Isaac, that is in the fiftieth year of the life of Jacob, in that year died Shem the son of Noah; Shem was six hundred years old at his death.",

        "28:27": "For the wife of Laban was barren in those days, and bare no children, and also all his handmaids bare none to him.",
        "28:28": "And the Lord afterward remembered Adinah the wife of Laban, and she conceived and bare twin daughters, and Laban called the names of his daughters, the name of the elder Leah, and the name of the younger Rachel.",
        "28:29": "And those people came and told these things to Rebecca, and Rebecca rejoiced greatly that the Lord had visited her brother and that he had got children.",
        "29:1": "And Isaac the son of Abraham became old and advanced in days, and his eyes became heavy through age; they were dim and could not see.",
        "29:2": "At that time Isaac called unto Esau his son, saying, Get I pray thee thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, rise up and go forth into the field and get me some venison, and make me savory meat and bring it to me, that I may eat in order that I may bless thee before my death, as I have now become old and gray-headed.",
        "29:3": "And Esau did so; and he took his weapon and went forth into the field to hunt for venison, as usual, to bring to his father as he had ordered him, so that he might bless him.",
        "29:4": "And Rebecca heard all the words that Isaac had spoken unto Esau, and she hastened and called her son Jacob, saying, Thus did thy father speak unto thy brother Esau, and thus did I hear, now therefore hasten thou and make that which I shall tell thee.",
        "29:5": "Rise up and go, I pray thee, to the flock and fetch me two fine kids of the goats, and I will get the savory meat for thy father, and thou shalt bring the savory meat that he may eat before thy brother shall have come from the chase, in order that thy father may bless thee.",
        "29:6": "And Jacob hastened and did as his mother had commanded him, and he made the savory meat and brought it before his father before Esau had come from his chase.",
        "29:7": "And Isaac said unto Jacob, Who art thou, my son? And he said, I am thy first born Esau, I have done as thou didst order me, now therefore rise up I pray thee, and eat of my hunt, in order that thy soul may bless me as thou didst speak unto me.",
        "29:8": "And Isaac rose up and he ate and he drank, and his heart was comforted, and he blessed Jacob and Jacob went away from his father; and as soon as Isaac had blessed Jacob and he had gone away from him, behold Esau came from his hunt from the field, and he also made savory meat and brought it to his father to eat thereof and to bless him.",
        "29:9": "And Isaac said unto Esau, And who was he that has taken venison and brought it me before thou camest and whom I did bless? And Esau knew that his brother Jacob had done this, and the anger of Esau was kindled against his brother Jacob that he had acted thus toward him.",
        "29:10": "And Esau said, Is he not rightly called Jacob? for he has supplanted me twice, he took away my birthright and now he has taken away my blessing; and Esau wept greatly; and when Isaac heard the voice of his son Esau weeping, Isaac said unto Esau, What can I do, my son, thy brother came with subtlety and took away thy blessing; and Esau hated his brother Jacob on account of the blessing that his father had given him, and his anger was greatly roused against him.",
        "29:11": "And Jacob was very much afraid of his brother Esau, and he rose up and fled to the house of Eber the son of Shem, and he concealed himself there on account of his brother, and Jacob was sixty-three years old when he went forth from the land of Canaan from Hebron, and Jacob was concealed in Eber's house fourteen years on account of his brother Esau, and he there continued to learn the ways of the Lord and his commandments.",
        "29:12": "And when Esau saw that Jacob had fled and escaped from him, and that Jacob had cunningly obtained the blessing, then Esau grieved exceedingly, and he was also vexed at his father and mother; and he also rose up and took his wife and went away from his father and mother to the land of Seir, and he dwelt there; and Esau saw there a woman from amongst the daughters of Heth whose name was Bosmath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and he took her for a wife in addition to his first wife, and Esau called her name Adah, saying the blessing had in that time passed from him.",
        "29:13": "And Esau dwelt in the land of Seir six months without seeing his father and mother, and afterward Esau took his wives and rose up and returned to the land of Canaan, and Esau placed his two wives in his father's house in Hebron.",
        "29:14": "And the wives of Esau vexed and provoked Isaac and Rebecca with their works, for they walked not in the ways of the Lord, but served their father's gods of wood and stone as their father had taught them, and they were more wicked than their father.",
        "29:15": "And they went according to the evil desires of their hearts, and they sacrificed and burnt incense to the Baalim, and Isaac and Rebecca became weary of them.",
        "29:16": "And Rebecca said, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth; if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good then is life unto me?",
        "29:17": "And in those days Adah the wife of Esau conceived and bare him a son, and Esau called the name of the son that was born unto him Eliphaz, and Esau was sixty-five years old when she bare him.",
        "29:18": "And Ishmael the son of Abraham died in those days, in the sixty-forth year of the life of Jacob, and all the days that Ishmael lived were one hundred and thirty-seven years and he died.",
        "29:19": "And when Isaac heard that Ishmael was dead he mourned for him, and Isaac lamented over him many days.",
        "29:20": "And at the end of fourteen years of Jacob's residing in the house of Eber, Jacob desired to see his father and mother, and Jacob came to the house of his father and mother to Hebron, and Esau had in those days forgotten what Jacob had done to him in having taken the blessing from him in those days.",
        "29:21": "And when Esau saw Jacob coming to his father and mother he remembered what Jacob had done to him, and he was greatly incensed against him and he sought to slay him.",
        "29:22": "And Isaac the son of Abraham was old and advanced in days, and Esau said, Now my father's time is drawing nigh that he must die, and when he shall die I will slay my brother Jacob.",
        "29:23": "And this was told to Rebecca, and she hastened and sent and called for Jacob her son, and she said unto him, Arise, go and flee to Haran to my brother Laban, and remain there for some time, until thy brother's anger be turned from thee and then shalt thou come back.",
        "29:24": "And Isaac called unto Jacob and said unto him, Take not a wife from the daughters of Canaan, for thus did our father Abraham command us according to the word of the Lord which he had commanded him, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; if thy children keep my covenant that I have made with thee, then will I also perform to thy children that which I have spoken unto thee and I will not forsake them.",
        "29:25": "Now therefore my son hearken to my voice, to all that I shall command thee, and refrain from taking a wife from amongst the daughters of Canaan; arise, go to Haran to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father, and take unto thee a wife from there from the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother.",
        "29:26": "Therefore take heed lest thou shouldst forget the Lord thy God and all his ways in the land to which thou goest, and shouldst get connected with the people of the land and pursue vanity and forsake the Lord thy God.",
        "29:27": "But when thou comest to the land serve there the Lord, do not turn to the right or to the left from the way which I commanded thee and which thou didst learn.",
        "29:28": "And may the Almighty God grant thee favor in the sight of the people of the earth, that thou mayest take there a wife according to thy choice; one who is good and upright in the ways of the Lord.",
        "29:29": "And may God give unto thee and thy seed the blessing of thy father Abraham, and make thee fruitful and multiply thee, and mayest thou become a multitude of people in the land whither thou goest, and may God cause thee to return to this land, the land of thy father's dwelling, with children and with great riches, with joy and with pleasure.",
        "29:30": "And Isaac finished commanding Jacob and blessing him, and he gave him many gifts, together with silver and gold, and he sent him away; and Jacob hearkened to his father and mother; he kissed them and arose and went to Padan-aram; and Jacob was seventy-seven years old when he went out from the land of Canaan from Beersheba.",
        "29:31": "And when Jacob went away to go to Haran Esau called unto his son Eliphaz, and secretly spoke unto him, saying, Now hasten, take thy sword in thy hand and pursue Jacob and pass before him in the road, and lurk for him, and slay him with thy sword in one of the mountains, and take all belonging to him and come back.",
        "29:32": "And Eliphaz the son of Esau was an active man and expert with the bow as his father had taught him, and he was a noted hunter in the field and a valiant man.",
        "29:33": "And Eliphaz did as his father had commanded him, and Eliphaz was at that time thirteen years old, and Eliphaz rose up and went and took ten of his mother's brothers with him and pursued Jacob.",
        "29:34": "And he closely followed Jacob, and he lurked for him in the border of the land of Canaan opposite to the city of Shechem.",
        "29:35": "And Jacob saw Eliphaz and his men pursuing him, and Jacob stood still in the place in which he was going, in order to know what this was, for he did not know the thing; and Eliphaz drew his sword and he went on advancing, he and his men, toward Jacob; and Jacob said unto them, What is to do with you that you have come hither, and what meaneth it that you pursue with your swords.",
        "29:36": "And Eliphaz came near to Jacob and he answered and said unto him, Thus did my father command me, and now therefore I will not deviate from the orders which my father gave me; and when Jacob saw that Esau had spoken to Eliphaz to employ force, Jacob then approached and supplicated Eliphaz and his men, saying to him,",
        "29:37": "Behold all that I have and which my father and mother gave unto me, that take unto thee and go from me, and do not slay me, and may this thing be accounted unto thee a righteousness.",
        "29:38": "And the Lord caused Jacob to find favor in the sight of Eliphaz the son of Esau, and his men, and they hearkened to the voice of Jacob, and they did not put him to death, and Eliphaz and his men took all belonging to Jacob together with the silver and gold that he had brought with him from Beersheba; they left him nothing.",
        "29:39": "And Eliphaz and his men went away from him and they returned to Esau to Beersheba, and they told him all that had occurred to them with Jacob, and they gave him all that they had taken from Jacob.",
        "29:40": "And Esau was indignant at Eliphaz his son, and at his men that were with him, because they had not put Jacob to death.",
        "29:41": "And they answered and said unto Esau, Because Jacob supplicated us in this matter not to slay him, our pity was excited toward him, and we took all belonging to him and brought it unto thee; and Esau took all the silver and gold which Eliphaz had taken from Jacob and he put them by in his house.",
        "29:42": "At that time when Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and had commanded him, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife from amongst the daughters of Canaan, and that the daughters of Canaan were bad in the sight of Isaac and Rebecca,",
        "29:43": "Then he went to the house of Ishmael his uncle, and in addition to his older wives he took Machlath the daughter of Ishmael, the sister of Nebayoth, for a wife.",
        "30:1": "And Jacob went forth continuing his road to Haran, and he came as far as mount Moriah, and he tarried there all night near the city of Luz; and the Lord appeared there unto Jacob on that night, and he said unto him, I am the Lord God of Abraham and the God of Isaac thy father; the land upon which thou liest I will give unto thee and thy seed.",
        "30:2": "And behold I am with thee and will keep thee wherever thou goest, and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of Heaven, and I will cause all thine enemies to fall before thee; and when they shall make war with thee they shall not prevail over thee, and I will bring thee again unto this land with joy, with children, and with great riches.",
        "30:3": "And Jacob awoke from his sleep and he rejoiced greatly at the vision which he had seen; and he called the name of that place Bethel.",
        "30:4": "And Jacob rose up from that place quite rejoiced, and when he walked his feet felt light to him for joy, and he went from there to the land of the children of the East, and he returned to Haran and he set by the shepherd's well.",
        "30:5": "And he there found some men; going from Haran to feed their flocks, and Jacob made inquiries of them, and they said, We are from Haran.",
        "30:6": "And he said unto them, Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor? and they said, We know him, and behold his daughter Rachel is coming along to feed her father's flock.",
        "30:7": "Whilst he was yet speaking with them, Rachel the daughter of Laban came to feed her father's sheep, for she was a shepherdess.",

        "31:12": "And Laban answered Jacob, saying, Not so is it done in our place to give the younger before the elder now therefore if thou desirest to take her sister likewise, take her unto thee for the service which thou wilt serve me for another seven years.",
        "31:13": "And Jacob did so, and he also took Rachel for a wife, and he served Laban seven years more, and Jacob also came to Rachel, and he loved Rachel more than Leah, and Laban gave her his maid Bilhah for a handmaid.",
        "31:14": "And when the Lord saw that Leah was hated, the Lord opened her womb, and she conceived and bare Jacob four sons in those days.",
        "31:15": "And these are their names, Reuben Simeon, Levi, and Judah, and she afterward left bearing.",
        "31:16": "And at that time Rachel was barren, and she had no offspring, and Rachel envied her sister Leah, and when Rachel saw that she bare no children to Jacob, she took her handmaid Bilhah, and she bare Jacob two sons, Dan and Naphtali.",
        "31:17": "And when Leah saw that she had left bearing, she also took her handmaid Zilpah, and she gave her to Jacob for a wife, and Jacob also came to Zilpah, and she also bare Jacob two sons, Gad and Asher.",
        "31:18": "And Leah again conceived and bare Jacob in those days two sons and one daughter, and these are their names, Issachar, Zebulon, and their sister Dinah.",
        "31:19": "And Rachel was still barren in those days, and Rachel prayed unto the Lord at that time, and she said, O Lord God remember me and visit me, I beseech thee, for now my husband will cast me off, for I have borne him no children.",
        "31:20": "Now O Lord God, hear my supplication before thee, and see my affliction, and give me children like one of the handmaids, that I may no more bear my reproach.",
        "31:21": "And God heard her and opened her womb, and Rachel conceived and bare a son, and she said, The Lord has taken away my reproach, and she called his name Joseph, saying, May the Lord add to me another son; and Jacob was ninety-one years old when she bare him.",
        "31:22": "At that time Jacob's mother, Rebecca, sent her nurse Deborah the daughter of Uz, and two of Isaac's servants unto Jacob.",
        "31:23": "And they came to Jacob to Haran and they said unto him, Rebecca has sent us to thee that thou shalt return to thy father's house to the land of Canaan; and Jacob hearkened unto them in this which his mother had spoken.",
        "31:24": "At that time, the other seven years which Jacob served Laban for Rachel were completed, and it was at the end of fourteen years that he had dwelt in Haran that Jacob said unto Laban, give me my wives and send me away, that I may go to my land, for behold my mother did send unto me from the land at Canaan that I should return to my father's house.",
        "31:25": "And Laban said unto him, Not so I pray thee; if I have found favor in thy sight do not leave me; appoint me thy wages and I will give them, and remain with me.",
        "31:26": "And Jacob said unto him, This is what thou shalt give me for wages, that I shall this day pass through all thy flock and take away from them every lamb that is speckled and spotted and such as are brown amongst the sheep, and amongst the goats, and if thou wilt do this thing for me I will return and feed thy flock and keep them as at first.",
        "31:27": "And Laban did so, and Laban removed from his flock all that Jacob had said and gave them to him.",
        "31:28": "And Jacob placed all that he had removed from Laban's flock in the hands of his sons, and Jacob was feeding the remainder of Laban's flock.",
        "31:29": "And when the servants of Isaac which he had sent unto Jacob saw that Jacob would not then return with them to the land of Canaan to his father, they then went away from him, and they returned home to the land of Canaan.",
        "31:30": "And Deborah remained with Jacob in Haran, and she did not return with the servants of Isaac to the land of Canaan, and Deborah resided with Jacob's wives and children in Haran.",
        "31:31": "And Jacob served Laban six years longer, and when the sheep brought forth, Jacob removed from them such as were speckled and spotted, as he had determined with Laban, and Jacob did so at Laban's for six years, and the man increased abundantly and he had cattle and maid servants and men servants, camels, and asses.",
        "31:32": "And Jacob had two hundred drove of cattle, and his cattle were of large size and of beautiful appearance and were very productive, and all the families of the sons of men desired to get some of the cattle of Jacob, for they were exceedingly prosperous.",
        "31:33": "And many of the sons of men came to procure some of Jacob's flock, and Jacob gave them a sheep for a man servant or a maid servant or for an ass or a camel, or whatever Jacob desired from them they gave him.",
        "31:34": "And Jacob obtained riches and honor and possessions by means of these transactions with the sons of men, and the children of Laban envied him of this honor.",
        "31:35": "And in the course of time he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob has taken away all that was our father's, and of that which was our father's has he acquired all this glory.",
        "31:36": "And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban and of his children, and behold it was not toward him in those days as it had been before.",
        "31:37": "And the Lord appeared to Jacob at the expiration of the six years, and said unto him, Arise, go forth out of this land, and return to the land of thy birthplace and I will be with thee.",
        "31:38": "And Jacob rose up at that time and he mounted his children and wives and all belonging to him upon camels, and he went forth to go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac.",
        "31:39": "And Laban did not know that Jacob had gone from him, for Laban had been that day sheep-shearing.",
        "31:40": "And Rachel stole her father's images, and she took them and she concealed them upon the camel upon which she sat, and she went on.",
        "31:41": "And this is the manner of the images; in taking a man who is the first born and slaying him and taking the hair off his head, and taking salt and salting the head and anointing it in oil, then taking a small tablet of copper or a tablet of gold and writing the name upon it, and placing the tablet under his tongue, and taking the head with the tablet under the tongue and putting it in the house, and lighting up lights before it and bowing down to it.",
        "31:42": "And at the time when they bow down to it, it speaketh to them in all matters that they ask of it, through the power of the name which is written in it.",
        "31:43": "And some make them in the figures of men, of gold and silver, and go to them in times known to them, and the figures receive the influence of the stars, and tell them future things, and in this manner were the images which Rachel stole from her father.",
        "31:44": "And Rachel stole these images which were her father's, in order that Laban might not know through them where Jacob had gone.",
        "31:45": "And Laban came home and he asked concerning Jacob and his household, and he was not to be found, and Laban sought his images to know where Jacob had gone, and could not find them, and he went to some other images, and he inquired of them and they told him that Jacob had fled from him to his father's, to the land of Canaan.",
        "31:46": "And Laban then rose up and he took his brothers and all his servants, and he went forth and pursued Jacob, and he overtook him in mount Gilead.",
        "31:47": "And Laban said unto Jacob, What is this thou hast done to me to flee and deceive me, and lead my daughters and their children as captives taken by the sword?",
        "31:48": "And thou didst not suffer me to kiss them and send them away with joy, and thou didst steal my gods and didst go away.",
        "31:49": "And Jacob answered Laban, saying, Because I was afraid lest thou wouldst take thy daughters by force from me; and now with whomsoever thou findest thy gods he shall die.",
        "31:50": "And Laban searched for the images and he examined in all Jacob's tents and furniture, but could not find them.",
        "31:51": "And Laban said unto Jacob, We will make a covenant together and it shall be a testimony between me and thee; if thou shalt afflict my daughters, or shalt take other wives besides my daughters, even God shall be a witness between me and thee in this matter.",
        "31:52": "And they took stones and made a heap, and Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee, therefore he called the name thereof Gilead.",
        "31:53": "And Jacob and Laban offered sacrifice upon the mount, and they ate there by the heap, and they tarried in the mount all night, and Laban rose up early in the morning, and he wept with his daughters and he kissed them, and he returned unto his place.",
        "31:54": "And he hastened and sent off his son Beor, who was seventeen years old, with Abichorof the son of Uz, the son of Nahor, and with them were ten men.",
        "31:55": "And they hastened and went and passed on the road before Jacob, and they came by another road to the land of Seir.",
        "31:56": "And they came unto Esau and said unto him, Thus saith thy brother and relative, thy mother's brother Laban, the son of Bethuel, saying,",
        "31:57": "Hast thou heard what Jacob thy brother has done unto me, who first came to me naked and bare, and I went to meet him, and brought him to my house with honor, and I made him great, and I gave him my two daughters for wives and also two of my maids.",
        "31:58": "And God blessed him on my account, and he increased abundantly, and had sons, daughters and maid servants.",
        "31:59": "He has also an immense stock of flocks and herds, camels and asses, also silver and gold in abundance; and when he saw that his wealth increased, he left me whilst I went to shear my sheep, and he rose up and fled in secrecy.",
        "31:60": "And he lifted his wives and children upon camels, and he led away all his cattle and property which he acquired in my land, and he lifted up his countenance to go to his father Isaac, to the land of Canaan.",
        "31:61": "And he did not suffer me to kiss my daughters and their children, and he led my daughters as captives taken by the sword, and he also stole my gods and he fled.",
        "31:62": "And now I have left him in the mountain of the brook of Jabuk, him and all belonging to him; he lacketh nothing.",
        "31:63": "If it be thy wish to go to him, go then and there wilt thou find him, and thou canst do unto him as thy soul desireth; and Laban's messengers came and told Esau all these things.",
        "31:64": "And Esau heard all the words of Laban's messengers, and his anger was greatly kindled against Jacob, and he remembered his hatred, and his anger burned within him.",
        "31:65": "And Esau hastened and took his children and servants and the souls of his household, being sixty men, and he went and assembled all the children of Seir the Horite and their people, being three hundred and forty men, and took all this number of four hundred men with drawn swords, and he went unto Jacob to smite him.",
        "31:66": "And Esau divided this number into several parts, and he took the sixty men of his children and servants and the souls of his household as one head, and gave them in care of Eliphaz his eldest son.",
        "31:67": "And the remaining heads he gave to the care of the six sons of Seir the Horite, and he placed every man over his generations and children.",
        "31:68": "And the whole of this camp went as it was, and Esau went amongst them toward Jacob, and he conducted them with speed.",
        "31:69": "And Laban's messengers departed from Esau and went to the land of Canaan, and they came to the house of Rebecca the mother of Jacob and Esau.",
        "31:70": "And they told her saying, Behold thy son Esau has gone against his brother Jacob with four hundred men, for he heard that he was coming, and he is gone to make war with him, and to smite him and to take all that he has.",
        "31:71": "And Rebecca hastened and sent seventy two men from the servants of Isaac to meet Jacob on the road; for she said, Peradventure, Esau may make war in the road when he meets him.",
        "31:72": "And these messengers went on the road to meet Jacob, and they met him in the road of the brook on the opposite side of the brook Jabuk, and Jacob said when he saw them, This camp is destined to me from God, and Jacob called the name of that place Machnayim.",
        "31:73": "And Jacob knew all his father's people, and he kissed them and embraced them and came with them, and Jacob asked them concerning his father and mother, and they said, They were well.",
        "31:74": "And these messengers said unto Jacob, Rebecca thy mother has sent us to thee, saying, I have heard, my son, that thy brother Esau has gone forth against thee on the road with men from the children of Seir the Horite.",
        "31:75": "And therefore, my son, hearken to my voice and see with thy counsel what thou wilt do, and when he cometh up to thee, supplicate him, and do not speak rashly to him, and give him a present from what thou possessest, and from what God has favored thee with.",
        "31:76": "And when he asketh thee concerning thy affairs, conceal nothing from him, perhaps he may turn from his anger against thee and thou wilt thereby save thy soul, thou and all belonging to thee, for it is thy duty to honor him, for he is thy elder brother.",
        "31:77": "And when Jacob heard the words of his mother which the messengers had spoken to him, Jacob lifted up his voice and wept bitterly, and did as his mother then commanded him.",
        "32:1": "And at that time Jacob sent messengers to his brother Esau toward the land of Seir, and he spoke to him words of supplication.",
        "32:2": "And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say to my lord, to Esau, Thus saith thy servant Jacob, Let not my lord imagine that my father's blessing with which he did bless me has proved beneficial to me.",
        "32:3": "For I have been these twenty years with Laban, and he deceived me and changed my wages ten times, as it has all been already told unto my lord.",
        "32:4": "And I served him in his house very laboriously, and God afterward saw my affliction, my labor and the work of my hands, and he caused me to find grace and favor in his sight.",
        "32:5": "And I afterward through God's great mercy and kindness acquired oxen and asses and cattle, and men servants and maid servants.",
        "32:6": "And now I am coming to my land and my home to my father and mother, who are in the land of Canaan; and I have sent to let my lord know all this in order to find favor in the sight of my lord, so that he may not imagine that I have of myself obtained wealth, or that the blessing with which my father blessed me has benefited me.",
        "32:7": "And those messengers went to Esau, and found him on the borders of the land of Edom going toward Jacob, and four hundred men of the children of Seir the Horite were standing with drawn swords.",
        "32:8": "And the messengers of Jacob told Esau all the words that Jacob had spoken to them concerning Esau.",
        "32:9": "And Esau answered them with pride and contempt, and said unto them, Surely I have heard and truly it has been told unto me what Jacob has done to Laban, who exalted him in his house and gave him his daughters for wives, and he begat sons and daughters, and abundantly increased in wealth and riches in Laban's house through his means.",
        "32:10": "And when he saw that his wealth was abundant and his riches great he fled with all belonging to him, from Laban's house, and he led Laban's daughters away from the face of their father, as captives taken by the sword without telling him of it.",
        "32:11": "And not only to Laban has Jacob done thus but also unto me has he done so and has twice supplanted me, and shall I be silent?",
        "32:12": "Now therefore I have this day come with my camps to meet him, and I will do unto him according to the desire of my heart.",
        "32:13": "And the messengers returned and came to Jacob and said unto him, We came to thy brother, to Esau, and we told him all thy words, and thus has he answered us, and behold he cometh to meet thee with four hundred men.",
        "32:14": "Now then know and see what thou shalt do, and pray before God to deliver thee from him.",
        "32:15": "And when he heard the words of his brother which he had spoken to the messengers of Jacob, Jacob was greatly afraid and he was distressed.",
        "32:16": "And Jacob prayed to the Lord his God, and he said, O Lord God of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, thou didst say unto me when I went away from my father's house, saying,",
        "32:17": "I am the Lord God of thy father Abraham and the God of Isaac, unto thee do I give this land and thy seed after thee, and I will make thy seed as the stars of heaven, and thou shalt spread forth to the four sides of heaven, and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.",
        "32:18": "And thou didst establish thy words, and didst give unto me riches and children and cattle, as the utmost wishes of my heart didst thou give unto thy servant; thou didst give unto me all that I asked from thee, so that I lacked nothing.",
        "32:19": "And thou didst afterward say unto me, Return to thy parents and to thy birth place and I will still do well with thee.",
        "32:20": "And now that I have come, and thou didst deliver me from Laban, I shall fall in the hands of Esau who will slay me, yea, together with the mothers of my children.",
        "32:21": "Now therefore, O Lord God, deliver me, I pray thee, also from the hands of my brother Esau, for I am greatly afraid of him.",
        "32:22": "And if there is no righteousness in me, do it for the sake of Abraham and my father Isaac.",
        "32:23": "For I know that through kindness and mercy have I acquired this wealth; now therefore I beseech thee to deliver me this day with thy kindness and to answer me.",
        "32:24": "And Jacob ceased praying to the Lord, and he divided the people that were with him with the flocks and cattle into two camps, and he gave the half to the care of Damesek, the son of Eliezer, Abraham's servant, for a camp, with his children, and the other half he gave to the care of his brother Elianus the son of Eliezer, to be for a camp with his children.",
        "32:25": "And he commanded them, saying, Keep yourselves at a distance with your camps, and do not come too near each other, and if Esau come to one camp and slay it, the other camp at a distance from it will escape him.",
        "32:26": "And Jacob tarried there that night, and during the whole night he gave his servants instructions concerning the forces and his children.",
        "32:27": "And the Lord heard the prayer of Jacob on that day, and the Lord then delivered Jacob from the hands of his brother Esau.",
        "32:28": "And the Lord sent three angels of the angels of heaven, and they went before Esau and came to him.",
        "32:29": "And these angels appeared unto Esau and his people as two thousand men, riding upon horses furnished with all sorts of war instruments, and they appeared in the sight of Esau and all his men to be divided into four camps, with four chiefs to them.",
        "32:30": "And one camp went on and they found Esau coming with four hundred men toward his brother Jacob, and this camp ran toward Esau and his people and terrified them, and Esau fell off the horse in alarm, and all his men separated from him in that place, for they were greatly afraid.",
        "32:31": "And the whole of the camp shouted after them when they fled from Esau, and all the warlike men answered, saying,",
        "32:32": "Surely we are the servants of Jacob, who is the servant of God, and who then can stand against us? And Esau said unto them, O then, my lord and brother Jacob is your lord, whom I have not seen for these twenty years, and now that I have this day come to see him, do you treat me in this manner?",
        "32:33": "And the angels answered him saying, As the Lord liveth, were not Jacob of whom thou speaketh thy brother, we had not let one remaining from thee and thy people, but only on account of Jacob we will do nothing to them.",
        "32:34": "And this camp passed from Esau and his men and it went away, and Esau and his men had gone from them about a league when the second camp came toward him with all sorts of weapons, and they also did unto Esau and his men as the first camp had done to them.",
        "32:35": "And when they had left it to go on, behold the third camp came toward him and they were all terrified, and Esau fell off the horse, and the whole camp cried out, and said, Surely we are the servants of Jacob, who is the servant of God, and who can stand against us?",
        "32:36": "And Esau again answered them saying, O then, Jacob my lord and your lord is my brother, and for twenty years I have not seen his countenance and hearing this day that he was coming, I went this day to meet him, and do you treat me in this manner?",
        "32:37": "And they answered him, and said unto him, As the Lord liveth, were not Jacob thy brother as thou didst say, we had not left a remnant from thee and thy men, but on account of Jacob of whom thou speakest being thy brother, we will not meddle with thee or thy men.",
        "32:38": "And the third camp also passed from them, and he still continued his road with his men toward Jacob, when the fourth camp came toward him, and they also did unto him and his men as the others had done.",
        "32:39": "And when Esau beheld the evil which the four angels had done to him and to his men, he became greatly afraid of his brother Jacob, and he went to meet him in peace.",
        "32:40": "And Esau concealed his hatred against Jacob, because he was afraid of his life on account of his brother Jacob, and because he imagined that the four camps that he had lighted upon were Jacob's servants.",
        "32:41": "And Jacob tarried that night with his servants in their camps, and he resolved with his servants to give unto Esau a present from all that he had with him, and from all his property; and Jacob rose up in the morning, he and his men, and they chose from amongst the cattle a present for Esau.",
        "32:42": "And this is the amount of the present which Jacob chose from his flock to give unto his brother Esau: and he selected two hundred and forty head from the flocks, and he selected from the camels and asses thirty each, and of the herds he chose fifty kine.",
        "32:43": "And he put them all in ten droves, and he placed each sort by itself, and he delivered them into the hands of ten of his servants, each drove by itself.",
        "32:44": "And he commanded them, and said unto them, Keep yourselves at a distance from each other, and put a space between the droves, and when Esau and those who are with him shall meet you and ask you, saying, Whose are you, and whither do you go, and to whom belongeth all this before you, you shall say unto them, We are the servants of Jacob, and we come to meet Esau in peace, and behold Jacob cometh behind us.",
        "32:45": "And that which is before us is a present sent from Jacob to his brother Esau.",
        "32:46": "And if they shall say unto you, Why doth he delay behind you, from coming to meet his brother and to see his face, then you shall say unto them, Surely he cometh joyfully behind us to meet his brother, for he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth to him, and after this I will see his face, peradventure he will accept of me.",
        "32:47": "So the whole present passed on in the hands of his servants, and went before him on that day, and he lodged that night with his camps by the border of the brook of Jabuk, and he rose up in the midst of the night, and he took his wives and his maid servants, and all belonging to him, and he that night passed them over the ford Jabuk.",
        "32:48": "And when he passed all belonging to him over the brook, Jacob was left by himself, and a man met him, and he wrestled with him that night until the breaking of the day, and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint through wrestling with him.",
        "32:49": "And at the break of day the man left Jacob there, and he blessed him and went away, and Jacob passed the brook at the break of day, and he halted upon his thigh.",
        "32:50": "And the sun rose upon him when he had passed the brook, and he came up to the place of his cattle and children.",
        "32:51": "And they went on till midday, and whilst they were going the present was passing on before them.",
        "32:52": "And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold Esau was at a distance, coming along with many men, about four hundred, and Jacob was greatly afraid of his brother.",
        "32:53": "And Jacob hastened and divided his children unto his wives and his handmaids, and his daughter Dinah he put in a chest, and delivered her into the hands of his servants.",
        "32:54": "And he passed before his children and wives to meet his brother, and he bowed down to the ground, yea he bowed down seven times until he approached his brother, and God caused Jacob to find grace and favor in the sight of Esau and his men, for God had heard the prayer of Jacob.",
        "32:55": "And the fear of Jacob and his terror fell upon his brother Esau, for Esau was greatly afraid of Jacob for what the angels of God had done to Esau, and Esau's anger against Jacob was turned into kindness.",
        "32:56": "And when Esau saw Jacob running toward him, he also ran toward him and he embraced him, and he fell upon his neck, and they kissed and they wept.",
        "32:57": "And God put fear and kindness toward Jacob in the hearts of the men that came with Esau, and they also kissed Jacob and embraced him.",
        "32:58": "And also Eliphaz, the son of Esau, with his four brothers, sons of Esau, wept with Jacob, and they kissed him and embraced him, for the fear of Jacob had fallen upon them all.",
        "32:59": "And Esau lifted up his eyes and saw the women with their offspring, the children of Jacob, walking behind Jacob and bowing along the road to Esau.",
        "32:60": "And Esau said unto Jacob, Who are these with thee, my brother? are they thy children or thy servants? and Jacob answered Esau and said, They are my children which God hath graciously given to thy servant.",
        "32:61": "And whilst Jacob was speaking to Esau and his men, Esau beheld the whole camp, and he said unto Jacob, Whence didst thou get the whole of the camp that I met yesternight? and Jacob said, To find favor in the sight of my lord, it is that which God graciously gave to thy servant.",
        "32:62": "And the present came before Esau, and Jacob pressed Esau, saying, Take I pray thee the present that I have brought to my lord, and Esau said, Wherefore is this my purpose? keep that which thou hast unto thyself.",
        "32:63": "And Jacob said, It is incumbent upon me to give all this, since I have seen thy face, that thou still livest in peace.",
        "32:64": "And Esau refused to take the present, and Jacob said unto him, I beseech thee my lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand, for I have therefore seen thy face, as though I had seen a god-like face, because thou wast pleased with me.",
        "32:65": "And Esau took the present, and Jacob also gave unto Esau silver and gold and bdellium, for he pressed him so much that he took them.",
        "32:66": "And Esau divided the cattle that were in the camp, and he gave the half to the men who had come with him, for they had come on hire, and the other half he delivered unto the hands of his children.",
        "32:67": "And the silver and gold and bdellium he gave in the hands of Eliphaz his eldest son, and Esau said unto Jacob, Let us remain with thee, and we will go slowly along with thee until thou comest to my place with me, that we may dwell there together.",
        "32:68": "And Jacob answered his brother and said, I would do as my lord speaketh unto me, but my lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with their young who are with me, go but slowly, for if they went swiftly they would all die, for thou knowest their burdens and their fatigue.",
        "32:69": "Therefore let my lord pass on before his servant, and I will go on slowly for the sake of the children and the flock, until I come to my lord's place to Seir.",
        "32:70": "And Esau said unto Jacob, I will place with thee some of the people that are with me to take care of thee in the road, and to bear thy fatigue and burden, and he said, What needeth it my lord, if I may find grace in thy sight?",
        "32:71": "Behold I will come unto thee to Seir to dwell there together as thou hast spoken, go thou then with thy people for I will follow thee.",
        "32:72": "And Jacob said this to Esau in order to remove Esau and his men from him, so that Jacob might afterward go to his father's house to the land of Canaan.",
        "32:73": "And Esau hearkened to the voice of Jacob, and Esau returned with the four hundred men that were with him on their road to Seir, and Jacob and all belonging to him went that day as far as the extremity of the land of Canaan in its borders, and he remained there some time.",
        "33:1": "And in some time after Jacob went away from the borders of the land, and he came to the land of Shalem, that is the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, and he rested in front of the city.",
        "33:2": "And he bought a parcel of the field which was there, from the children of Hamor the people of the land, for five shekels.",
        "33:3": "And Jacob there built himself a house, and he pitched his tent there, and he made booths for his cattle, therefore he called the name of that place Succoth.",
        "33:4": "And Jacob remained in Succoth a year and six months.",
        "33:5": "At that time some of the women of the inhabitants of the land went to the city of Shechem to dance and rejoice with the daughters of the people of the city, and when they went forth then Rachel and Leah the wives of Jacob with their families also went to behold the rejoicing of the daughters of the city.",
        "33:6": "And Dinah the daughter of Jacob also went along with them and saw the daughters of the city, and they remained there before these daughters whilst all the people of the city were standing by them to behold their rejoicings, and all the great people of the city were there.",
        "33:7": "And Shechem the son of Hamor, the prince of the land was also standing there to see them.",
        "33:8": "And Shechem beheld Dinah the daughter of Jacob sitting with her mother before the daughters of the city, and the damsel pleased him greatly, and he there asked his friends and his people, saying, Whose daughter is that sitting amongst the women, whom I do not know in this city?",
        "33:9": "And they said unto him, Surely this is the daughter of Jacob the son of Isaac the Hebrew, who has dwelt in this city for some time, and when it was reported that the daughters of the land were going forth to rejoice she went with her mother and maid servants to sit amongst them as thou seest.",
        "33:10": "And Shechem beheld Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and when he looked at her his soul became fixed upon Dinah.",
        "33:11": "And he sent and had her taken by force, and Dinah came to the house of Shechem and he seized her forcibly and lay with her and humbled her, and he loved her exceedingly and placed her in his house.",
        "33:12": "And they came and told the thing unto Jacob, and when Jacob heard that Shechem had defiled his daughter Dinah, Jacob sent twelve of his servants to fetch Dinah from the house of Shechem, and they went and came to the house of Shechem to take away Dinah from there.",
        "33:13": "And when they came Shechem went out to them with his men and drove them from his house, and he would not suffer them to come before Dinah, but Shechem was sitting with Dinah kissing and embracing her before their eyes.",
        "33:14": "And the servants of Jacob came back and told him, saying, When we came, he and his men drove us away, and thus did Shechem do unto Dinah before our eyes.",
        "33:15": "And Jacob knew moreover that Shechem had defiled his daughter, but he said nothing, and his sons were feeding his cattle in the field, and Jacob remained silent till their return.",
        "33:16": "And before his sons came home Jacob sent two maidens from his servants' daughters to take care of Dinah in the house of Shechem, and to remain with her, and Shechem sent three of his friends to his father Hamor the son of Chiddekem, the son of Pered, saying, Get me this damsel for a wife.",
        "33:17": "And Hamor the son of Chiddekem the Hivite came to the house of Shechem his son, and he sat before him, and Hamor said unto his son, Shechem, Is there then no woman amongst the daughters of thy people that thou wilt take an Hebrew woman who is not of thy people?",
        "33:18": "And Shechem said to him, Her only must thou get for me, for she is delightful in my sight; and Hamor did according to the word of his son, for he was greatly beloved by him.",
        "33:19": "And Hamor went forth to Jacob to commune with him concerning this matter, and when he had gone from the house of his son Shechem, before he came to Jacob to speak unto him, behold the sons of Jacob had come from the field, as soon as they heard the thing that Shechem the son of Hamor had done.",
        "33:20": "And the men were very much grieved concerning their sister, and they all came home fired with anger, before the time of gathering in their cattle.",
        "33:21": "And they came and sat before their father and they spoke unto him kindled with wrath, saying, Surely death is due to this man and to his household, because the Lord God of the whole earth commanded Noah and his children that man shall never rob, nor commit adultery; now behold Shechem has both ravaged and committed fornication with our sister, and not one of all the people of the city spoke a word to him.",
        "33:22": "Surely thou knowest and understandest that the judgment of death is due to Shechem, and to his father, and to the whole city on account of the thing which he has done.",
        "33:23": "And whilst they were speaking before their father in this matter, behold Hamor the father of Shechem came to speak to Jacob the words of his son concerning Dinah, and he sat before Jacob and before his sons.",
        "33:24": "And Hamor spoke unto them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter; I pray you give her unto him for a wife and intermarry with us; give us your daughters and we will give you our daughters, and you shall dwell with us in our land and we will be as one people in the land.",
        "33:25": "For our land is very extensive, so dwell ye and trade therein and get possessions in it, and do therein as you desire, and no one shall prevent you by saying a word to you.",
        "33:26": "And Hamor ceased speaking unto Jacob and his sons, and behold Shechem his son had come after him, and he sat before them.",
        "33:27": "And Shechem spoke before Jacob and his sons, saying, May I find favor in your sight that you will give me your daughter, and whatever you say unto me that will I do for her.",
        "33:28": "Ask me for abundance of dowry and gift, and I will give it, and whatever you shall say unto me that will I do, and whoever he be that will rebel against your orders, he shall die; only give me the damsel for a wife.",
        "33:29": "And Simeon and Levi answered Hamor and Shechem his son deceitfully, saying, All you have spoken unto us we will do for you.",
        "33:30": "And behold our sister is in your house, but keep away from her until we send to our father Isaac concerning this matter, for we can do nothing without his consent.",
        "33:31": "For he knoweth the ways of our father Abraham, and whatever he sayeth unto us we will tell you, we will conceal nothing from you.",
        "33:32": "And Simeon and Levi spoke this unto Shechem and his father in order to find a pretext, and to seek counsel what was to be done to Shechem and to his city in this matter.",
        "33:33": "And when Shechem and his father heard the words of Simeon and Levi, it seemed good in their sight, and Shechem and his father came forth to go home.",
        "33:34": "And when they had gone, the sons of Jacob said unto their father, saying, Behold, we know that death is due to these wicked ones and to their city, because they transgressed that which God had commanded unto Noah and his children and his seed after them.",
        "33:35": "And also because Shechem did this thing to our sister Dinah in defiling her, for such vileness shall never be done amongst us.",
        "33:36": "Now therefore know and see what you will do, and seek counsel and pretext what is to be done to them, in order to kill all the inhabitants of this city.",
        "33:37": "And Simeon said to them, Here is a proper advice for you: tell them to circumcise every male amongst them as we are circumcised, and if they do not wish to do this, we shall take our daughter from them and go away.",
        "33:38": "And if they consent to do this and will do it, then when they are sunk down with pain, we will attack them with our swords, as upon one who is quiet and peaceable, and we will slay every male person amongst them.",
        "33:39": "And Simeon's advice pleased them, and Simeon and Levi resolved to do unto them as it was proposed.",
        "33:40": "And on the next morning Shechem and Hamor his father came again unto Jacob and his sons, to speak concerning Dinah, and to hear what answer the sons of Jacob would give to their words.",
        "33:41": "And the sons of Jacob spoke deceitfully to them, saying, We told our father Isaac all your words, and your words pleased him.",
        "33:42": "But he spoke unto us, saying, Thus did Abraham his father command him from God the Lord of the whole earth, that any man who is not of his descendants that should wish to take one of his daughters, shall cause every male belonging to him to be circumcised, as we are circumcised, and then we may give him our daughter for a wife.",
        "33:43": "Now we have made known to you all our ways that our father spoke unto us, for we cannot do this of which you spoke unto us, to give our daughter to an uncircumcised man, for it is a disgrace to us.",
        "33:44": "But herein will we consent to you, to give you our daughter, and we will also take unto ourselves your daughters, and will dwell amongst you and be one people as you have spoken, if you will hearken to us, and consent to be like us, to circumcise every male belonging to you, as we are circumcised.",
        "33:45": "And if you will not hearken unto us, to have every male circumcised as we are circumcised, as we have commanded, then we will come to you, and take our daughter from you and go away.",
        "33:46": "And Shechem and his father Hamor heard the words of the sons of Jacob, and the thing pleased them exceedingly, and Shechem and his father Hamor hastened to do the wishes of the sons of Jacob, for Shechem was very fond of Dinah, and his soul was riveted to her.",
        "33:47": "And Shechem and his father Hamor hastened to the gate of the city, and they assembled all the men of their city and spoke unto them the words of the sons of Jacob, saying,",
        "33:48": "We came to these men, the sons of Jacob, and we spoke unto them concerning their daughter, and these men will consent to do according to our wishes, and behold our land is of great extent for them, and they will dwell in it, and trade in it, and we shall be one people; we will take their daughters, and our daughters we will give unto them for wives.",
        "33:49": "But only on this condition will these men consent to do this thing, that every male amongst us be circumcised as they are circumcised, as their God commanded them, and when we shall have done according to their instructions to be circumcised, then will they dwell amongst us, together with their cattle and possessions, and we shall be as one people with them.",
        "33:50": "And when all the men of the city heard the words of Shechem and his father Hamor, then all the men of their city were agreeable to this proposal, and they obeyed to be circumcised, for Shechem and his father Hamor were greatly esteemed by them, being the princes of the land.",
        "33:51": "And on the next day, Shechem and Hamor his father rose up early in the morning, and they assembled all the men of their city into the middle of the city, and they called for the sons of Jacob, who circumcised every male belonging to them on that day and the next.",
        "33:52": "And they circumcised Shechem and Hamor his father, and the five brothers of Shechem, and then every one rose up and went home, for this thing was from the Lord against the city of Shechem, and from the Lord was Simeon's counsel in this matter, in order that the Lord might deliver the city of Shechem into the hands of Jacob's two sons.",
        "34:1": "And the number of all the males that were circumcised, were six hundred and forty-five men, and two hundred and forty-six children.",
        "34:2": "But Chiddekem, son of Pered, the father of Hamor, and his six brothers, would not listen unto Shechem and his father Hamor, and they would not be circumcised, for the proposal of the sons of Jacob was loathsome in their sight, and their anger was greatly roused at this, that the people of the city had not hearkened to them.",
        "34:3": "And in the evening of the second day, they found eight small children who had not been circumcised, for their mothers had concealed them from Shechem and his father Hamor, and from the men of the city.",
        "34:4": "And Shechem and his father Hamor sent to have them brought before them to be circumcised, when Chiddekem and his six brothers sprang at them with their swords, and sought to slay them.",
        "34:5": "And they sought to slay also Shechem and his father Hamor and they sought to slay Dinah with them on account of this matter.",
        "34:6": "And they said unto them, What is this thing that you have done? are there no women amongst the daughters of your brethren the Canaanites, that you wish to take unto yourselves daughters of the Hebrews, whom ye knew not before, and will do this act which your fathers never commanded you?",
        "34:7": "Do you imagine that you will succeed through this act which you have done? and what will you answer in this affair to your brethren the Canaanites, who will come tomorrow and ask you concerning this thing?",
        "34:8": "And if your act shall not appear just and good in their sight, what will you do for your lives, and me for our lives, in your not having hearkened to our voices?",
        "34:9": "And if the inhabitants of the land and all your brethren the children of Ham, shall hear of your act, saying,",
        "34:10": "On account of a Hebrew woman did Shechem and Hamor his father, and all the inhabitants of their city, do that with which they had been unacquainted and which their ancestors never commanded them, where then will you fly or where conceal your shame, all your days before your brethren, the inhabitants of the land of Canaan?",
        "34:11": "Now therefore we cannot bear up against this thing which you have done, neither can we be burdened with this yoke upon us, which our ancestors did not command us.",
        "34:12": "Behold tomorrow we will go and assemble all our brethren, the Canaanitish brethren who dwell in the land, and we will all come and smite you and all those who trust in you, that there shall not be a remnant left from you or them.",
        "34:13": "And when Hamor and his son Shechem and all the people of the city heard the words of Chiddekem and his brothers, they were terribly afraid of their lives at their words, and they repented of what they had done.",
        "34:14": "And Shechem and his father Hamor answered their father Chiddekem and his brethren, and they said unto them, All the words which you spoke unto us are true.",
        "34:15": "Now do not say, nor imagine in your hearts that on account of the love of the Hebrews we did this thing that our ancestors did not command us.",
        "34:16": "But because we saw that it was not their intention and desire to accede to our wishes concerning their daughter as to our taking her, except on this condition, so we hearkened to their voices and did this act which you saw, in order to obtain our desire from them.",
        "34:17": "And when we shall have obtained our request from them, we will then return to them and do unto them that which you say unto us.",
        "34:18": "We beseech you then to wait and tarry until our flesh shall be healed and we again become strong, and we will then go together against them, and do unto them that which is in your hearts and in ours.",
        "34:19": "And Dinah the daughter of Jacob heard all these words which Chiddekem and his brothers had spoken, and what Hamor and his son Shechem and the people of their city had answered them.",
        "34:20": "And she hastened and sent one of her maidens, that her father had sent to take care of her in the house of Shechem, to Jacob her father and to her brethren, saying:",
        "34:21": "Thus did Chiddekem and his brothers advise concerning you, and thus did Hamor and Shechem and the people of the city answer them.",
        "34:22": "And when Jacob heard these words he was filled with wrath, and he was indignant at them, and his anger was kindled against them.",
        "34:23": "And Simeon and Levi swore and said, As the Lord liveth, the God of the whole earth, by this time tomorrow, there shall not be a remnant left in the whole city.",
        "34:24": "And twenty young men had concealed themselves who were not circumcised, and these young men fought against Simeon and Levi, and Simeon and Levi killed eighteen of them, and two fled from them and escaped to some lime pits that were in the city, and Simeon and Levi sought for them, but could not find them.",
        "34:25": "And Simeon and Levi continued to go about in the city, and they killed all the people of the city at the edge of the sword, and they left none remaining.",
        "34:26": "And there was a great consternation in the midst of the city, and the cry of the people of the city ascended to heaven, and all the women and children cried aloud.",
        "34:27": "And Simeon and Levi slew all the city; they left not a male remaining in the whole city.",
        "34:28": "And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son at the edge of the sword, and they brought away Dinah from the house of Shechem and they went from there.",
        "34:29": "And the sons of Jacob went and returned, and came upon the slain, and spoiled all their property which was in the city and the field.",
        "34:30": "And whilst they were taking the spoil, three hundred men stood up and threw dust at them and struck them with stones, when Simeon turned to them and he slew them all with the edge of the sword, and Simeon turned before Levi, and came into the city.",
        "34:31": "And they took away their sheep and their oxen and their cattle, and also the remainder of the women and little ones, and they led all these away, and they opened a gate and went out and came unto their father Jacob with vigor.",
        "34:32": "And when Jacob saw all that they had done to the city, and saw the spoil that they took from them, Jacob was very angry at them, and Jacob said unto them, What is this that you have done to me? behold I obtained rest amongst the Canaanitish inhabitants of the land, and none of them meddled with me.",
        "34:33": "And now you have done to make me obnoxious to the inhabitants of the land, amongst the Canaanites and the Perizzites, and I am but of a small number, and they will all assemble against me and slay me when they hear of your work with their brethren, and I and my household will be destroyed.",
        "34:34": "And Simeon and Levi and all their brothers with them answered their father Jacob and said unto him, Behold we live in the land, and shall Shechem do this to our sister? why art thou silent at all that Shechem has done? and shall he deal with our sister as with a harlot in the streets?",
        "34:35": "And the number of women whom Simeon and Levi took captives from the city of Shechem, whom they did not slay, was eighty-five who had not known man.",
        "34:36": "And amongst them was a young damsel of beautiful appearance and well favored, whose name was Bunah, and Simeon took her for a wife, and the number of the males which they took captives and did not slay, was forty-seven men, and the rest they slew.",
        "34:37": "And all the young men and women that Simeon and Levi had taken captives from the city of Shechem, were servants to the sons of Jacob and to their children after them, until the day of the sons of Jacob going forth from the land of Egypt.",
        "34:38": "And when Simeon and Levi had gone forth from the city, the two young men that were left, who had concealed themselves in the city, and did not die amongst the people of the city, rose up, and these young men went into the city and walked about in it, and found the city desolate without man, and only women weeping, and these young men cried out and said, Behold, this is the evil which the sons of Jacob the Hebrew did to this city in their having this day destroyed one of the Canaanitish cities, and were not afraid of their lives of all the land of Canaan.",
        "34:39": "And these men left the city and went to the city of Tapnach, and they came there and told the inhabitants of Tapnach all that had befallen them, and all that the sons of Jacob had done to the city of Shechem.",
        "34:40": "And the information reached Jashub king of Tapnach, and he sent men to the city of Shechem to see those young men, for the king did not believe them in this account, saying, How could two men lay waste such a large town as Shechem?",
        "34:41": "And the messengers of Jashub came back and told him, saying, We came unto the city, and it is destroyed, there is not a man there; only weeping women; neither is any flock or cattle there, for all that was in the city the sons of Jacob took away.",
        "34:42": "And Jashub wondered at this, saying, How could two men do this thing, to destroy so large a city, and not one man able to stand against them?",
        "34:43": "For the like has not been from the days of Nimrod, and not even from the remotest time, has the like taken place; and Jashub, king of Tapnach, said to his people, Be courageous and we will go and fight against these Hebrews, and do unto them as they did unto the city, and we will avenge the cause of the people of the city.",
        "34:44": "And Jashub, king of Tapnach, consulted with his counsellors about this matter, and his advisers said unto him, Alone thou wilt not prevail over the Hebrews, for they must be powerful to do this work to the whole city.",
        "34:45": "If two of them laid waste the whole city, and no one stood against them, surely if thou wilt go against them, they will all rise against us and destroy us likewise.",
        "34:46": "But if thou wilt send to all the kings that surround us, and let them come together, then we will go with them and fight against the sons of Jacob; then wilt thou prevail against them.",
        "34:47": "And Jashub heard the words of his counsellors, and their words pleased him and his people, and he did so; and Jashub king of Tapnach sent to all the kings of the Amorites that surrounded Shechem and Tapnach, saying,",
        "34:48": "Go up with me and assist me, and we will smite Jacob the Hebrew and all his sons, and destroy them from the earth, for thus did he do to the city of Shechem, and do you not know of it?",
        "34:49": "And all the kings of the Amorites heard the evil that the sons of Jacob had done to the city of Shechem, and they were greatly astonished at them.",
        "34:50": "And the seven kings of the Amorites assembled with all their armies, about ten thousand men with drawn swords, and they came to fight against the sons of Jacob; and Jacob heard that the kings of the Amorites had assembled to fight against his sons, and Jacob was greatly afraid, and it distressed him.",
        "34:51": "And Jacob exclaimed against Simeon and Levi, saying, What is this act that you did? why have you injured me, to bring against me all the children of Canaan to destroy me and my household? for I was at rest, even I and my household, and you have done this thing to me, and provoked the inhabitants of the land against me by your proceedings.",
        "34:52": "And Judah answered his father, saying, Was it for naught my brothers Simeon and Levi killed all the inhabitants of Shechem? Surely it was because Shechem had humbled our sister, and transgressed the command of our God to Noah and his children, for Shechem took our sister away by force, and committed adultery with her.",
        "34:53": "And Shechem did all this evil and not one of the inhabitants of his city interfered with him, to say, Why wilt thou do this? surely for this my brothers went and smote the city, and the Lord delivered it into their hands, because its inhabitants had transgressed the commands of our God. Is it then for naught that they have done all this?",
        "34:54": "And now why art thou afraid or distressed, and why art thou displeased at my brothers, and why is thine anger kindled against them?",
        "34:55": "Surely our God who delivered into their hand the city of Shechem and its people, he will also deliver into our hands all the Canaanitish kings who are coming against us, and we will do unto them as my brothers did unto Shechem.",
        "34:56": "Now be tranquil about them and cast away thy fears, but trust in the Lord our God, and pray unto him to assist us and deliver us, and deliver our enemies into our hands.",
        "34:57": "And Judah called to one of his father's servants, Go now and see where those kings, who are coming against us, are situated with their armies.",
        "34:58": "And the servant went and looked far off, and went up opposite Mount Sihon, and saw all the camps of the kings standing in the fields, and he returned to Judah and said, Behold the kings are situated in the field with all their camps, a people exceedingly numerous, like unto the sand upon the sea shore.",
        "34:59": "And Judah said unto Simeon and Levi, and unto all his brothers, Strengthen yourselves and be sons of valor, for the Lord our God is with us, do not fear them.",
        "34:60": "Stand forth each man, girt with his weapons of war, his bow and his sword, and we will go and fight against these uncircumcised men; the Lord is our God, He will save us.",
        "34:61": "And they rose up, and each girt on his weapons of war, great and small, eleven sons of Jacob, and all the servants of Jacob with them.",
        "34:62": "And all the servants of Isaac who were with Isaac in Hebron, all came to them equipped in all sorts of war instruments, and the sons of Jacob and their servants, being one hundred and twelve men, went towards these kings, and Jacob also went with them.",
        "34:63": "And the sons of Jacob sent unto their father Isaac the son of Abraham to Hebron, the same is Kireath-arba, saying,",
        "34:64": "Pray we beseech thee for us unto the Lord our God, to protect us from the hands of the Canaanites who are coming against us, and to deliver them into our hands.",
        "34:65": "And Isaac the son of Abraham prayed unto the Lord for his sons, and he said, O Lord God, thou didst promise my father, saying, I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and thou didst also promise me, and establish thou thy word, now that the kings of Canaan are coming together, to make war with my children because they committed no violence.",
        "34:66": "Now therefore, O Lord God, God of the whole earth, pervert, I pray thee, the counsel of these kings that they may not fight against my sons.",
        "34:67": "And impress the hearts of these kings and their people with the terror of my sons and bring down their pride, and that they may turn away from my sons.",
        "34:68": "And with thy strong hand and outstretched arm deliver my sons and their servants from them, for power and might are in thy hands to do all this.",
        "34:69": "And the sons of Jacob and their servants went toward these kings, and they trusted in the Lord their God, and whilst they were going, Jacob their father also prayed unto the Lord and said, O Lord God, powerful and exalted God, who has reigned from days of old, from thence till now and forever;",
        "34:70": "Thou art He who stirreth up wars and causeth them to cease, in thy hand are power and might to exalt and to bring down; O may my prayer be acceptable before thee that thou mayest turn to me with thy mercies, to impress the hearts of these kings and their people with the terror of my sons, and terrify them and their camps, and with thy great kindness deliver all those that trust in thee, for it is thou who canst bring people under us and reduce nations under our power.",
        "35:1": "And all the kings of the Amorites came and took their stand in the field to consult with their counsellors what was to be done with the sons of Jacob, for they were still afraid of them, saying, Behold, two of them slew the whole of the city of Shechem.",
        "35:2": "And the Lord heard the prayers of Isaac and Jacob, and he filled the hearts of all these kings' advisers with great fear and terror that they unanimously exclaimed,",
        "35:3": "Are you silly this day, or is there no understanding in you, that you will fight with the Hebrews, and why will you take a delight in your own destruction this day?",
        "35:4": "Behold two of them came to the city of Shechem without fear or terror, and they killed all the inhabitants of the city, that no man stood up against them, and how will you be able to fight with them all?",
        "35:5": "Surely you know that their God is exceedingly fond of them, and has done mighty things for them, such as have not been done from days of old, and amongst all the gods of nations, there is none can do like unto his mighty deeds.",
        "35:6": "Surely he delivered their father Abraham, the Hebrew, from the hand of Nimrod, and from the hand of all his people who had many times sought to slay him.",
        "35:7": "He delivered him also from the fire in which king Nimrod had cast him, and his God delivered him from it.",
        "35:8": "And who else can do the like? surely it was Abraham who slew the five kings of Elam, when they had touched his brother's son who in those days dwelt in Sodom.",
        "35:9": "And took his servant that was faithful in his house and a few of his men, and they pursued the kings of Elam in one night and killed them, and restored to his brother's son all his property which they had taken from him.",
        "35:10": "And surely you know the God of these Hebrews is much delighted with them, and they are also delighted with him, for they know that he delivered them from all their enemies.",
        "35:11": "And behold through his love toward his God, Abraham took his only and precious son and intended to bring him up as a burnt offering to his God, and had it not been for God who prevented him from doing this, he would then have done it through his love to his God.",
        "35:12": "And God saw all his works, and swore unto him, and promised him that he would deliver his sons and all his seed from every trouble that would befall them, because he had done this thing, and through his love to his God stifled his compassion for his child.",
        "35:13": "And have you not heard what their God did to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to Abimelech king of Gerar, through taking Abraham's wife, who said of her, She is my sister, lest they might slay him on account of her, and think of taking her for a wife? and God did unto them and their people all that you heard of.",
        "35:14": "And behold, we ourselves saw with our eyes that Esau, the brother of Jacob, came to him with four hundred men, with the intention of slaying him, for he called to mind that he had taken away from him his father's blessing.",
        "35:15": "And he went to meet him when he came from Syria, to smite the mother with the children, and who delivered him from his hands but his God in whom he trusted? he delivered him from the hand of his brother and also from the hands of his enemies, and surely he again will protect them.",
        "35:16": "Who does not know that it was their God who inspired them with strength to do to the town of Shechem the evil which you heard of?",
        "35:17": "Could it then be with their own strength that two men could destroy such a large city as Shechem had it not been for their God in whom they trusted? he said and did unto them all this to slay the inhabitants of the city in their city.",
        "35:18": "And can you then prevail over them who have come forth together from your city to fight with the whole of them, even if a thousand times as many more should come to your assistance?",
        "35:19": "Surely you know and understand that you do not come to fight with them, but you come to war with their God who made choice of them, and you have therefore all come this day to be destroyed.",
        "35:20": "Now therefore refrain from this evil which you are endeavoring to bring upon yourselves, and it will be better for you not to go to battle with them, although they are but few in numbers, because their God is with them.",
        "35:21": "And when the kings of the Amorites heard all the words of their advisers, their hearts were filled with terror, and they were afraid of the sons of Jacob and would not fight against them.",
        "35:22": "And they inclined their ears to the words of their advisers, and they listened to all their words, and the words of the counsellors greatly pleased the kings, and they did so.",
        "35:23": "And the kings turned and refrained from the sons of Jacob, for they durst not approach them to make war with them, for they were greatly afraid of them, and their hearts melted within them from their fear of them.",
        "35:24": "For this proceeded from the Lord to them, for he heard the prayers of his servants Isaac and Jacob, for they trusted in him; and all these kings returned with their camps on that day, each to his own city, and they did not at that time fight with the sons of Jacob.",
        "35:25": "And the sons of Jacob kept their station that day till evening opposite mount Sihon, and seeing that these kings did not come to fight against them, the sons of Jacob returned home.",
        "36:1": "At that time the Lord appeared unto Jacob saying, Arise, go to Bethel and remain there, and make there an altar to the Lord who appeareth unto thee, who delivered thee and thy sons from affliction.",
        "36:2": "And Jacob rose up with his sons and all belonging to him, and they went and came to Bethel according to the word of the Lord.",
        "36:3": "And Jacob was ninety-nine years old when he went up to Bethel, and Jacob and his sons and all the people that were with him, remained in Bethel in Luz, and he there built an altar to the Lord who appeared unto him, and Jacob and his sons remained in Bethel six months.",
        "36:4": "At that time died Deborah the daughter of Uz, the nurse of Rebecca, who had been with Jacob; and Jacob buried her beneath Bethel under an oak that was there.",
        "36:5": "And Rebecca the daughter of Bethuel, the mother of Jacob, also died at that time in Hebron, the same is Kireath-arba, and she was buried in the cave of Machpelah which Abraham had bought from the children of Heth.",
        "36:6": "And the life of Rebecca was one hundred and thirty-three years, and she died and when Jacob heard that his mother Rebecca was dead he wept bitterly for his mother, and made a great mourning for her, and for Deborah her nurse beneath the oak, and he called the name of that place Allon-bachuth.",
        "36:7": "And Laban the Syrian died in those days, for God smote him because he transgressed the covenant that existed between him and Jacob.",
        "36:8": "And Jacob was a hundred years old when the Lord appeared unto him, and blessed him and called his name Israel, and Rachel the wife of Jacob conceived in those days.",
        "36:9": "And at that time Jacob and all belonging to him journeyed from Bethel to go to his father's house, to Hebron.",
        "36:10": "And whilst they were going on the road, and there was yet but a little way to come to Ephrath, Rachel bare a son and she had hard labor and she died.",
        "36:11": "And Jacob buried her in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem, and he set a pillar upon her grave, which is there unto this day; and the days of Rachel were forty-five years and she died.",
        "36:12": "And Jacob called the name of his son that was born to him, which Rachel bare unto him, Benjamin, for he was born to him in the land on the right hand.",
        "36:13": "And it was after the death of Rachel, that Jacob pitched his tent in the tent of her handmaid Bilhah.",
        "36:14": "And Reuben was jealous for his mother Leah on account of this, and he was filled with anger, and he rose up in his anger and went and entered the tent of Bilhah and he thence removed his father's bed.",
        "36:15": "At that time the portion of birthright, together with the kingly and priestly offices, was removed from the sons of Reuben, for he had profaned his father's bed, and the birthright was given unto Joseph, the kingly office to Judah, and the priesthood unto Levi, because Reuben had defiled his father's bed.",
        "36:16": "And these are the generations of Jacob who were born to him in Padan-aram, and the sons of Jacob were twelve.",

        "36:29": "And whilst he was feeding his father's asses he led them to the wilderness at different times to feed them.",
        "36:30": "And there was a day that he brought them to one of the deserts on the sea shore, opposite the wilderness of the people, and whilst he was feeding them, behold a very heavy storm came from the other side of the sea and rested upon the asses that were feeding there, and they all stood still.",
        "36:31": "And afterward about one hundred and twenty great and terrible animals came out from the wilderness at the other side of the sea, and they all came to the place where the asses were, and they placed themselves there.",
        "36:32": "And those animals, from their middle downward, were in the shape of the children of men, and from their middle upward, some had the likeness of bears, and some the likeness of the keephas, with tails behind them from between their shoulders reaching down to the earth, like the tails of the ducheephath, and these animals came and mounted and rode upon these asses, and led them away, and they went away unto this day.",

        "37:11": "And they sent a declaration to Jacob and his son, saying, Come you all forth to us that we may have an interview together in the plain, and revenge the cause of the men of Shechem whom you slew in their city, and you will now again return to the city of Shechem and dwell therein, and slay its inhabitants as before.",
        "37:12": "And the sons of Jacob heard this and their anger was kindled exceedingly at the words of the kings of Canaan, and ten of the sons of Jacob hastened and rose up, and each of them girt on his weapons of war; and there were one hundred and two of their servants with them equipped in battle array.",
        "37:13": "And all these men, the sons of Jacob with their servants, went toward these kings, and Jacob their father was with them, and they all stood upon the heap of Shechem.",
        "37:14": "And Jacob prayed to the Lord for his sons, and he spread forth his hands to the Lord, and he said, O God, thou art an Almighty God, thou art our father, thou didst form us and we are the works of thine hands; I pray thee deliver my sons through thy mercy from the hand of their enemies, who are this day coming to fight with them and save them from their hand, for in thy hand is power and might, to save the few from the many.",
        "37:15": "And give unto my sons, thy servants, strength of heart and might to fight with their enemies, to subdue them, and make their enemies fall before them, and let not my sons and their servants die through the hands of the children of Canaan.",
        "37:16": "But if it seemeth good in thine eyes to take away the lives of my sons and their servants, take them in thy great mercy through the hands of thy ministers, that they may not perish this day by the hands of the kings of the Amorites.",
        "37:17": "And when Jacob ceased praying to the Lord the earth shook from its place, and the sun darkened, and all these kings were terrified and a great consternation seized them.",
        "37:18": "And the Lord hearkened to the prayer of Jacob, and the Lord impressed the hearts of all the kings and their hosts with the terror and awe of the sons of Jacob.",
        "37:19": "For the Lord caused them to hear the voice of chariots, and the voice of mighty horses from the sons of Jacob, and the voice of a great army accompanying them.",
        "37:20": "And these kings were seized with great terror at the sons of Jacob, and whilst they were standing in their quarters, behold the sons of Jacob advanced upon them, with one hundred and twelve men, with a great and tremendous shouting.",
        "37:21": "And when the kings saw the sons of Jacob advancing toward them, they were still more panic struck, and they were inclined to retreat from before the sons of Jacob as at first, and not to fight with them.",
        "37:22": "But they did not retreat, saying, It would be a disgrace to us thus twice to retreat from before the Hebrews.",
        "37:23": "And the sons of Jacob came near and advanced against all these kings and their armies, and they saw, and behold it was a very mighty people, numerous as the sand of the sea.",
        "37:24": "And the sons of Jacob called unto the Lord and said, Help us O Lord, help us and answer us, for we trust in thee, and let us not die by the hands of these uncircumcised men, who this day have come against us.",
        "37:25": "And the sons of Jacob girt on their weapons of war, and they took in their hands each man his shield and his javelin, and they approached to battle.",
        "37:26": "And Judah, the son of Jacob, ran first before his brethren, and ten of his servants with him, and he went toward these kings.",
        "37:27": "And Jashub, king of Tapnach, also came forth first with his army before Judah, and Judah saw Jashub and his army coming toward him, and Judah's wrath was kindled, and his anger burned within him, and he approached to battle in which Judah ventured his life.",
        "37:28": "And Jashub and all his army were advancing toward Judah, and he was riding upon a very strong and powerful horse, and Jashub was a very valiant man, and covered with iron and brass from head to foot.",
        "37:29": "And whilst he was upon the horse, he shot arrows with both hands from before and behind, as was his manner in all his battles, and he never missed the place to which he aimed his arrows.",
        "37:30": "And when Jashub came to fight with Judah, and was darting many arrows against Judah, the Lord bound the hand of Jashub, and all the arrows that he shot rebounded upon his own men.",
        "37:31": "And notwithstanding this, Jashub kept advancing toward Judah, to challenge him with the arrows, but the distance between them was about thirty cubits, and when Judah saw Jashub darting forth his arrows against him, he ran to him with his wrath-excited might.",
        "37:32": "And Judah took up a large stone from the ground, and its weight was sixty shekels, and Judah ran toward Jashub, and with the stone struck him on his shield, that Jashub was stunned with the blow, and fell off from his horse to the ground.",
        "37:33": "And the shield burst asunder out of the hand of Jashub, and through the force of the blow sprang to the distance of about fifteen cubits, and the shield fell before the second camp.",
        "37:34": "And the kings that came with Jashub saw at a distance the strength of Judah, the son of Jacob, and what he had done to Jashub, and they were terribly afraid of Judah.",
        "37:35": "And they assembled near Jashub's camp, seeing his confusion, and Judah drew his sword and smote forty-two men of the camp of Jashub, and the whole of Jashub's camp fled before Judah, and no man stood against him, and they left Jashub and fled from him, and Jashub was still prostrate upon the ground.",
        "37:36": "And Jashub seeing that all the men of his camp had fled from him, hastened and rose up with terror against Judah, and stood upon his legs opposite Judah.",
        "37:37": "And Jashub had a single combat with Judah, placing shield toward shield, and Jashub's men all fled, for they were greatly afraid of Judah.",
        "37:38": "And Jashub took his spear in his hand to strike Judah upon his head, but Judah had quickly placed his shield to his head against Jashub's spear, so that the shield of Judah received the blow from Jashub's spear, and the shield was split in too.",
        "37:39": "And when Judah saw that his shield was split, he hastily drew his sword and smote Jashub at his ankles, and cut off his feet that Jashub fell upon the ground, and the spear fell from his hand.",
        "37:40": "And Judah hastily picked up Jashub's spear, with which he severed his head and cast it next to his feet.",
        "37:41": "And when the sons of Jacob saw what Judah had done to Jashub, they all ran into the ranks of the other kings, and the sons of Jacob fought with the army of Jashub, and the armies of all the kings that were there.",
        "37:42": "And the sons of Jacob caused fifteen thousand of their men to fall, and they smote them as if smiting at gourds, and the rest fled for their lives.",
        "37:43": "And Judah was still standing by the body of Jashub, and stripped Jashub of his coat of mail.",
        "37:44": "And Judah also took off the iron and brass that was about Jashub, and behold nine men of the captains of Jashub came along to fight against Judah.",
        "37:45": "And Judah hastened and took up a stone from the ground, and with it smote one of them upon the head, and his skull was fractured, and the body also fell from the horse to the ground.",
        "37:46": "And the eight captains that remained, seeing the strength of Judah, were greatly afraid and they fled, and Judah with his ten men pursued them, and they overtook them and slew them.",
        "37:47": "And the sons of Jacob were still smiting the armies of the kings, and they slew many of them, but those kings daringly kept their stand with their captains, and did not retreat from their places, and they exclaimed against those of their armies that fled from before the sons of Jacob, but none would listen to them, for they were afraid of their lives lest they should die.",
        "37:48": "And all the sons of Jacob, after having smitten the armies of the kings, returned and came before Judah, and Judah was still slaying the eight captains of Jashub, and stripping off their garments.",
        "37:49": "And Levi saw Elon, king of Gaash, advancing toward him, with his fourteen captains to smite him, but Levi did not know it for certain.",
        "37:50": "And Elon with his captains approached nearer, and Levi looked back and saw that battle was given him in the rear, and Levi ran with twelve of his servants, and they went and slew Elon and his captains with the edge of the sword.",
        "38:1": "And Ihuri king of Shiloh came up to assist Elon, and he approached Jacob, when Jacob drew his bow that was in his hand and with an arrow struck Ihuri which caused his death.",
        "38:2": "And when Ihuri king of Shiloh was dead, the four remaining kings fled from their station with the rest of the captains, and they endeavored to retreat, saying, We have no more strength with the Hebrews after their having killed the three kings and their captains who were more powerful than we are.",
        "38:3": "And when the sons of Jacob saw that the remaining kings had removed from their station, they pursued them, and Jacob also came from the heap of Shechem from the place where he was standing, and they went after the kings and they approached them with their servants.",
        "38:4": "And the kings and the captains with the rest of their armies, seeing that the sons of Jacob approached them, were afraid of their lives and fled till they reached the city of Chazar.",
        "38:5": "And the sons of Jacob pursued them to the gate of the city of Chazar, and they smote a great smiting amongst the kings and their armies, about four thousand men, and whilst they were smiting the army of the kings, Jacob was occupied with his bow confining himself to smiting the kings, and he slew them all.",
        "38:6": "And he slew Parathon king of Chazar at the gate of the city of Chazar, and he afterward smote Susi king of Sarton, and Laban king of Bethchorin, and Shabir king of Machnaymah, and he slew them all with arrows, an arrow to each of them, and they died.",
        "38:7": "And the sons of Jacob seeing that all the kings were dead and that they were broken up and retreating, continued to carry on the battle with the armies of the kings opposite the gate of Chazar, and they still smote about four hundred of their men.",
        "38:8": "And three men of the servants of Jacob fell in that battle, and when Judah saw that three of his servants had died, it grieved him greatly, and his anger burned within him against the Amorites.",
        "38:9": "And all the men that remained of the armies of the kings were greatly afraid of their lives, and they ran and broke the gate of the walls of the city of Chazar, and they all entered the city for safety.",
        "38:10": "And they concealed themselves in the midst of the city of Chazar, for the city of Chazar was very large and extensive, and when all these armies had entered the city, the sons of Jacob ran after them to the city.",
        "38:11": "And four mighty men, experienced in battle, went forth from the city and stood against the entrance of the city, with drawn swords and spears in their hands, and they placed themselves opposite the sons of Jacob, and would not suffer them to enter the city.",
        "38:12": "And Naphtali ran and came between them and with his sword smote two of them, and cut off their heads at one stroke.",
        "38:13": "And he turned to the other two, and behold they had fled, and he pursued them, overtook them, smote them and slew them.",
        "38:14": "And the sons of Jacob came to the city and saw, and behold there was another wall to the city, and they sought for the gate of the wall and could not find it, and Judah sprang upon the top of the wall, and Simeon and Levi followed him, and they all three descended from the wall into the city.",
        "38:15": "And Simeon and Levi slew all the men who ran for safety into the city, and also the inhabitants of the city with their wives and little ones, they slew with the edge of the sword, and the cries of the city ascended up to heaven.",
        "38:16": "And Dan and Naphtali sprang upon the wall to see what caused the noise of lamentation, for the sons of Jacob felt anxious about their brothers, and they heard the inhabitants of the city speaking with weeping and supplications, saying, Take all that we possess in the city and go away, only do not put us to death.",
        "38:17": "And when Judah, Simeon, and Levi had ceased smiting the inhabitants of the city, they ascended the wall and called to Dan and Naphtali, who were upon the wall, and to the rest of their brothers, and Simeon and Levi informed them of the entrance into the city, and all the sons of Jacob came to fetch the spoil.",
        "38:18": "And the sons of Jacob took the spoil of the city of Chazar, the flocks and herds, and the property, and they took all that could be captured, and went away that day from the city.",
        "38:19": "And on the next day the sons of Jacob went to Sarton, for they heard that the men of Sarton who had remained in the city were assembling to fight with them for having slain their king, and Sarton was a very high and fortified city, and it had a deep rampart surrounding the city.",
        "38:20": "And the pillar of the rampart was about fifty cubits and its breadth forty cubits, and there was no place for a man to enter the city on account of the rampart, and the sons of Jacob saw the rampart of the city, and they sought an entrance in it but could not find it.",
        "38:21": "For the entrance to the city was at the rear, and every man that wished to come into the city came by that road and went around the whole city, and he afterwards entered the city.",
        "38:22": "And the sons of Jacob seeing they could not find the way into the city, their anger was kindled greatly, and the inhabitants of the city seeing that the sons of Jacob were coming to them were greatly afraid of them, for they had heard of their strength and what they had done to Chazar.",
        "38:23": "And the inhabitants of the city of Sarton could not go out toward the sons of Jacob after having assembled in the city to fight against them, lest they might thereby get into the city, but when they saw that they were coming toward them, they were greatly afraid of them, for they had heard of their strength and what they had done to Chazar.",
        "38:24": "So the inhabitants of Sarton speedily took away the bridge of the road of the city, from its place, before the sons of Jacob came, and they brought it into the city.",
        "38:25": "And the sons of Jacob came and sought the way into the city, and could not find it and the inhabitants of the city went up to the top of the wall, and saw, and behold the sons of Jacob were seeking an entrance into the city.",
        "38:26": "And the inhabitants of the city reproached the sons of Jacob from the top of the wall, and they cursed them, and the sons of Jacob heard the reproaches, and they were greatly incensed, and their anger burned within them.",
        "38:27": "And the sons of Jacob were provoked at them, and they all rose and sprang over the rampart with the force of their strength, and through their might passed the forty cubits' breadth of the rampart.",
        "38:28": "And when they had passed the rampart they stood under the wall of the city, and they found all the gates of the city enclosed with iron doors.",
        "38:29": "And the sons of Jacob came near to break open the doors of the gates of the city, and the inhabitants did not let them, for from the top of the wall they were casting stones and arrows upon them.",
        "38:30": "And the number of the people that were upon the wall was about four hundred men, and when the sons of Jacob saw that the men of the city would not let them open the gates of the city, they sprang and ascended the top of the wall, and Judah went up first to the east part of the city.",
        "38:31": "And Gad and Asher went up after him to the west corner of the city, and Simeon and Levi to the north, and Dan and Reuben to the south.",
        "38:32": "And the men who were on the top of the wall, the inhabitants of the city, seeing that the sons of Jacob were coming up to them, they all fled from the wall, descended into the city, and concealed themselves in the midst of the city.",
        "38:33": "And Issachar and Naphtali that remained under the wall approached and broke the gates of the city, and kindled a fire at the gates of the city, that the iron melted, and all the sons of Jacob came into the city, they and all their men, and they fought with the inhabitants of the city of Sarton, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and no man stood up before them.",
        "38:34": "And about two hundred men fled from the city, and they all went and hid themselves in a certain tower in the city, and Judah pursued them to the tower and he broke down the tower, which fell upon the men, and they all died.",
        "38:35": "And the sons of Jacob went up the road of the roof of that tower, and they saw, and behold there was another strong and high tower at a distance in the city, and the top of it reached to heaven, and the sons of Jacob hastened and descended, and went with all their men to that tower, and found it filled with about three hundred men, women and little ones.",
        "38:36": "And the sons of Jacob smote a great smiting amongst those men in the tower and they ran away and fled from them.",
        "38:37": "And Simeon and Levi pursued them, when twelve mighty and valiant men came out to them from the place where they had concealed themselves.",
        "38:38": "And those twelve men maintained a strong battle against Simeon and Levi, and Simeon and Levi could not prevail over them, and those valiant men broke the shields of Simeon and Levi, and one of them struck at Levi's head with his sword, when Levi hastily placed his hand to his head, for he was afraid of the sword, and the sword struck Levi's hand, and it wanted but little to the hand of Levi being cut off.",
        "38:39": "And Levi seized the sword of the valiant man in his hand, and took it forcibly from the man, and with it he struck at the head of the powerful man, and he severed his head.",
        "38:40": "And eleven men approached to fight with Levi, for they saw that one of them was killed, and the sons of Jacob fought, but the sons of Jacob could not prevail over them, for those men were very powerful.",
        "38:41": "And the sons of Jacob seeing that they could not prevail over them, Simeon gave a loud and tremendous shriek, and the eleven powerful men were stunned at the voice of Simeon's shrieking.",
        "38:42": "And Judah at a distance knew the voice of Simeon's shouting, and Naphtali and Judah ran with their shields to Simeon and Levi, and found them fighting with those powerful men, unable to prevail over them as their shields were broken.",
        "38:43": "And Naphtali saw that the shields of Simeon and Levi were broken, and he took two shields from his servants and brought them to Simeon and Levi.",
        "38:44": "And Simeon, Levi and Judah on that day fought all three against the eleven mighty men until the time of sunset, but they could not prevail over them.",
        "38:45": "And this was told unto Jacob, and he was sorely grieved, and he prayed unto the Lord, and he and Naphtali his son went against these mighty men.",
        "38:46": "And Jacob approached and drew his bow, and came nigh unto the mighty men, and slew three of their men with the bow, and the remaining eight turned back, and behold, the war waged against them in the front and rear, and they were greatly afraid of their lives, and could not stand before the sons of Jacob, and they fled from before them.",
        "38:47": "And in their flight they met Dan and Asher coming toward them, and they suddenly fell upon them, and fought with them, and slew two of them, and Judah and his brothers pursued them, and smote the remainder of them, and slew them.",
        "38:48": "And all the sons of Jacob returned and walked about the city, searching if they could find any men, and they found about twenty young men in a cave in the city, and Gad and Asher smote them all, and Dan and Naphtali lighted upon the rest of the men who had fled and escaped from the second tower, and they smote them all.",
        "38:49": "And the sons of Jacob smote all the inhabitants of the city of Sarton, but the women and little ones they left in the city and did not slay them.",
        "38:50": "And all the inhabitants of the city of Sarton were powerful men, one of them would pursue a thousand, and two of them would not flee from ten thousand of the rest of men.",
        "38:51": "And the sons of Jacob slew all the inhabitants of the city of Sarton with the edge of the sword, that no man stood up against them, and they left the women in the city.",
        "38:52": "And the sons of Jacob took all the spoil of the city, and captured what they desired, and they took flocks and herds and property from the city, and the sons of Jacob did unto Sarton and its inhabitants as they had done to Chazar and its inhabitants, and they turned and went away.",
        "39:1": "And when the sons of Jacob went from the city of Sarton, they had gone about two hundred cubits when they met the inhabitants of Tapnach coming toward them, for they went out to fight with them, because they had smitten the king of Tapnach and all his men.",
        "39:2": "So all that remained in the city of Tapnach came out to fight with the sons of Jacob, and they thought to retake from them the booty and the spoil which they had captured from Chazar and Sarton.",
        "39:3": "And the rest of the men of Tapnach fought with the sons of Jacob in that place, and the sons of Jacob smote them, and they fled before them, and they pursued them to the city of Arbelan, and they all fell before the sons of Jacob.",
        "39:4": "And the sons of Jacob returned and came to Tapnach, to take away the spoil of Tapnach, and when they came to Tapnach they heard that the people of Arbelan had gone out to meet them to save the spoil of their brethren, and the sons of Jacob left ten of their men in Tapnach to plunder the city, and they went out toward the people of Arbelan.",
        "39:5": "And the men of Arbelan went out with their wives to fight with the sons of Jacob, for their wives were experienced in battle, and they went out, about four hundred men and women.",
        "39:6": "And all the sons of Jacob shouted with a loud voice, and they all ran toward the inhabitants of Arbelan, and with a great and tremendous voice.",
        "39:7": "And the inhabitants of Arbelan heard the noise of the shouting of the sons of Jacob, and their roaring like the noise of lions and like the roaring of the sea and its waves.",
        "39:8": "And fear and terror possessed their hearts on account of the sons of Jacob, and they were terribly afraid of them, and they retreated and fled before them into the city, and the sons of Jacob pursued them to the gate of the city, and they came upon them in the city.",
        "39:9": "And the sons of Jacob fought with them in the city, and all their women were engaged in slinging against the sons of Jacob, and the combat was very severe amongst them the whole of that day till evening.",
        "39:10": "And the sons of Jacob could not prevail over them, and the sons of Jacob had almost perished in that battle, and the sons of Jacob cried unto the Lord and greatly gained strength toward evening, and the sons of Jacob smote all the inhabitants of Arbelan by the edge of the sword, men, women and little ones.",
        "39:11": "And also the remainder of the people who had fled from Sarton, the sons of Jacob smote them in Arbelan, and the sons of Jacob did unto Arbelan and Tapnach as they had done to Chazar and Sarton, and when the women saw that all the men were dead, they went upon the roofs of the city and smote the sons of Jacob by showering down stones like rain.",
        "39:12": "And the sons of Jacob hastened and came into the city and seized all the women and smote them with the edge of the sword, and the sons of Jacob captured all the spoil and booty, flocks and herds and cattle.",
        "39:13": "And the sons of Jacob did unto Machnaymah as they had done to Tapnach, to Chazar and to Shiloh, and they turned from there and went away.",
        "39:14": "And on the fifth day the sons of Jacob heard that the people of Gaash had gathered against them to battle, because they had slain their king and their captains, for there had been fourteen captains in the city of Gaash, and the sons of Jacob had slain them all in the first battle.",
        "39:15": "And the sons of Jacob that day girt on their weapons of war, and they marched to battle against the inhabitants of Gaash, and in Gaash there was a strong and mighty people of the people of the Amorites, and Gaash was the strongest and best fortified city of all the cities of the Amorites, and it had three walls.",
        "39:16": "And the sons of Jacob came to Gaash and they found the gates of the city locked, and about five hundred men standing at the top of the outer-most wall, and a people numerous as the sand upon the sea shore were in ambush for the sons of Jacob from without the city at the rear thereof.",
        "39:17": "And the sons of Jacob approached to open the gates of the city, and whilst they were drawing nigh, behold those who were in ambush at the rear of the city came forth from their places and surrounded the sons of Jacob.",
        "39:18": "And the sons of Jacob were enclosed between the people of Gaash, and the battle was both to their front and rear, and all the men that were upon the wall, were casting from the wall upon them, arrows and stones.",
        "39:19": "And Judah, seeing that the men of Gaash were getting too heavy for them, gave a most piercing and tremendous shriek and all the men of Gaash were terrified at the voice of Judah's cry, and men fell from the wall at his powerful shriek, and all those that were from without and within the city were greatly afraid of their lives.",
        "39:20": "And the sons of Jacob still came nigh to break the doors of the city, when the men of Gaash threw stones and arrows upon them from the top of the wall, and made them flee from the gate.",
        "39:21": "And the sons of Jacob returned against the men of Gaash who were with them from without the city, and they smote them terribly, as striking against gourds, and they could not stand against the sons of Jacob, for fright and terror had seized them at the shriek of Judah.",
        "39:22": "And the sons of Jacob slew all those men who were without the city, and the sons of Jacob still drew nigh to effect an entrance into the city, and to fight under the city walls, but they could not for all the inhabitants of Gaash who remained in the city had surrounded the walls of Gaash in every direction, so that the sons of Jacob were unable to approach the city to fight with them.",
        "39:23": "And the sons of Jacob came nigh to one corner to fight under the wall, the inhabitants of Gaash threw arrows and stones upon them like showers of rain, and they fled from under the wall.",
        "39:24": "And the people of Gaash who were upon the wall, seeing that the sons of Jacob could not prevail over them from under the wall, reproached the sons of Jacob in these words, saying,",
        "39:25": "What is the matter with you in the battle that you cannot prevail? can you then do unto the mighty city of Gaash and its inhabitants as you did to the cities of the Amorites that were not so powerful? Surely to those weak ones amongst us you did those things, and slew them in the entrance of the city, for they had no strength when they were terrified at the sound of your shouting.",
        "39:26": "And will you now then be able to fight in this place? Surely here you will all die, and we will avenge the cause of those cities that you have laid waste.",
        "39:27": "And the inhabitants of Gaash greatly reproached the sons of Jacob and reviled them with their gods, and continued to cast arrows and stones upon them from the wall.",
        "39:28": "And Judah and his brothers heard the words of the inhabitants of Gaash and their anger was greatly roused, and Judah was jealous of his God in this matter, and he called out and said, O Lord, help, send help to us and our brothers.",
        "39:29": "And he ran at a distance with all his might, with his drawn sword in his hand, and he sprang from the earth and by dint of his strength, mounted the wall, and his sword fell from his hand.",
        "39:30": "And Judah shouted upon the wall, and all the men that were upon the wall were terrified, and some of them fell from the wall into the city and died, and those who were yet upon the wall, when they saw Judah's strength, they were greatly afraid and fled for their lives into the city for safety.",
        "39:31": "And some were emboldened to fight with Judah upon the wall, and they came nigh to slay him when they saw there was no sword in Judah's hand, and they thought of casting him from the wall to his brothers, and twenty men of the city came up to assist them, and they surrounded Judah and they all shouted over him, and approached him with drawn swords, and they terrified Judah, and Judah cried out to his brothers from the wall.",
        "39:32": "And Jacob and his sons drew the bow from under the wall, and smote three of the men that were upon the top of the wall, and Judah continued to cry and he exclaimed, O Lord help us, O Lord deliver us, and he cried out with a loud voice upon the wall, and the cry was heard at a great distance.",
        "39:33": "And after this cry he again repeated to shout, and all the men who surrounded Judah on the top of the wall were terrified, and they each threw his sword from his hand at the sound of Judah's shouting and his tremor, and fled.",
        "39:34": "And Judah took the swords which had fallen from their hands, and Judah fought with them and slew twenty of their men upon the wall.",
        "39:35": "And about eighty men and women still ascended the wall from the city and they all surrounded Judah, and the Lord impressed the fear of Judah in their hearts, that they were unable to approach him.",
        "39:36": "And Jacob and all who were with him drew the bow from under the wall, and they slew ten men upon the wall, and they fell below the wall, before Jacob and his sons.",
        "39:37": "And the people upon the wall seeing that twenty of their men had fallen, they still ran toward Judah with drawn swords, but they could not approach him for they were greatly terrified at Judah's strength.",
        "39:38": "And one of their mighty men whose name was Arud approached to strike Judah upon the head with his sword, when Judah hastily put his shield to his head, and the sword hit the shield, and it was split in two.",
        "39:39": "And this mighty man after he had struck Judah ran for his life, at the fear of Judah, and his feet slipped upon the wall and he fell amongst the sons of Jacob who were below the wall, and the sons of Jacob smote him and slew him.",
        "39:40": "And Judah's head pained him from the blow of the powerful man, and Judah had nearly died from it.",
        "39:41": "And Judah cried out upon the wall owing to the pain produced by the blow, when Dan heard him, and his anger burned within him, and he also rose up and went at a distance and ran and sprang from the earth and mounted the wall with his wrath-excited strength.",
        "39:42": "And when Dan came upon the wall near unto Judah all the men upon the wall fled, who had stood against Judah, and they went up to the second wall, and they threw arrows and stones upon Dan and Judah from the second wall, and endeavored to drive them from the wall.",
        "39:43": "And the arrows and stones struck Dan and Judah, and they had nearly been killed upon the wall, and wherever Dan and Judah fled from the wall, they were attacked with arrows and stones from the second wall.",
        "39:44": "And Jacob and his sons were still at the entrance of the city below the first wall, and they were not able to draw their bow against the inhabitants of the city, as they could not be seen by them, being upon the second wall.",
        "39:45": "And Dan and Judah when they could no longer bear the stones and arrows that fell upon them from the second wall, they both sprang upon the second wall near the people of the city, and when the people of the city who were upon the second wall saw that Dan and Judah had come to them upon the second wall, they all cried out and descended below between the walls.",
        "39:46": "And Jacob and his sons heard the noise of the shouting from the people of the city, and they were still at the entrance of the city, and they were anxious about Dan and Judah who were not seen by them, they being upon the second wall.",
        "39:47": "And Naphtali went up with his wrath-excited might and sprang upon the first wall to see what caused the noise of shouting which they had heard in the city, and Issachar and Zebulun drew nigh to break the doors of the city, and they opened the gates of the city and came into the city.",
        "39:48": "And Naphtali leaped from the first wall to the second, and came to assist his brothers, and the inhabitants of Gaash who were upon the wall, seeing that Naphtali was the third who had come up to assist his brothers, they all fled and descended into the city, and Jacob and all his sons and all their young men came into the city to them.",
        "39:49": "And Judah and Dan and Naphtali descended from the wall into the city and pursued the inhabitants of the city, and Simeon and Levi were from without the city and knew not that the gate was opened, and they went up from there to the wall and came down to their brothers into the city.",
        "39:50": "And the inhabitants of the city had all descended into the city, and the sons of Jacob came to them in different directions, and the battle waged against them from the front and the rear, and the sons of Jacob smote them terribly, and slew about twenty thousand of them men and women, not one of them could stand up against the sons of Jacob.",
        "39:51": "And the blood flowed plentifully in the city, and it was like a brook of water, and the blood flowed like a brook to the outer part of the city, and reached the desert of Bethchorin.",
        "39:52": "And the people of Bethchorin saw at a distance the blood flowing from the city of Gaash, and about seventy men from amongst them ran to see the blood, and they came to the place where the blood was.",
        "39:53": "And they followed the track of the blood and came to the wall of the city of Gaash, and they saw the blood issue from the city, and they heard the voice of crying from the inhabitants of Gaash, for it ascended unto heaven, and the blood was continuing to flow abundantly like a brook of water.",
        "39:54": "And all the sons of Jacob were still smiting the inhabitants of Gaash, and were engaged in slaying them till evening, about twenty thousand men and women, and the people of Chorin said, Surely this is the work of the Hebrews, for they are still carrying on war in all the cities of the Amorites.",
        "39:55": "And those people hastened and ran to Bethchorin, and each took his weapons of war, and they cried out to all the inhabitants of Bethchorin, who also girt on their weapons of war to go and fight with the sons of Jacob.",
        "39:56": "And when the sons of Jacob had done smiting the inhabitants of Gaash, they walked about the city to strip all the slain, and coming in the innermost part of the city and farther on they met three very powerful men, and there was no sword in their hand.",
        "39:57": "And the sons of Jacob came up to the place where they were, and the powerful men ran away, and one of them had taken Zebulun, who he saw was a young lad and of short stature, and with his might dashed him to the ground.",
        "39:58": "And Jacob ran to him with his sword and Jacob smote him below his loins with the sword, and cut him in two, and the body fell upon Zebulun.",
        "39:59": "And the second one approached and seized Jacob to fell him to the ground, and Jacob turned to him and shouted to him, whilst Simeon and Levi ran and smote him on the hips with the sword and felled him to the ground.",
        "39:60": "And the powerful man rose up from the ground with wrath-excited might, and Judah came to him before he had gained his footing, and struck him upon the head with the sword, and his head was split and he died.",
        "39:61": "And the third powerful man, seeing that his companions were killed, ran from before the sons of Jacob, and the sons of Jacob pursued him in the city; and whilst the powerful man was fleeing he found one of the swords of the inhabitants of the city, and he picked it up and turned to the sons of Jacob and fought them with that sword.",
        "39:62": "And the powerful man ran to Judah to strike him upon the head with the sword, and there was no shield in the hand of Judah; and whilst he was aiming to strike him, Naphtali hastily took his shield and put it to Judah's head, and the sword of the powerful man hit the shield of Naphtali and Judah escaped the sword.",
        "39:63": "And Simeon and Levi ran upon the powerful man with their swords and struck at him forcibly with their swords, and the two swords entered the body of the powerful man and divided it in two, length-wise.",
        "39:64": "And the sons of Jacob smote the three mighty men at that time, together with all the inhabitants of Gaash, and the day was about to decline.",
        "39:65": "And the sons of Jacob walked about Gaash and took all the spoil of the city, even the little ones and women they did not suffer to live, and the sons of Jacob did unto Gaash as they had done to Sarton and Shiloh.",
        "40:1": "And the sons of Jacob led away all the spoil of Gaash, and went out of the city by night.",
        "40:2": "They were going out marching toward the castle of Bethchorin, and the inhabitants of Bethchorin were going to the castle to meet them, and on that night the sons of Jacob fought with the inhabitants of Bethchorin, in the castle of Bethchorin.",
        "40:3": "And all the inhabitants of Bethchorin were mighty men, one of them would not flee from before a thousand men, and they fought on that night upon the castle, and their shouts were heard on that night from afar, and the earth quaked at their shouting.",
        "40:4": "And all the sons of Jacob were afraid of those men, as they were not accustomed to fight in the dark, and they were greatly confounded, and the sons of Jacob cried unto the Lord, saying, Give help to us O Lord, deliver us that we may not die by the hands of these uncircumcised men.",
        "40:5": "And the Lord hearkened to the voice of the sons of Jacob, and the Lord caused great terror and confusion to seize the people of Bethchorin, and they fought amongst themselves the one with the other in the darkness of night, and smote each other in great numbers.",
        "40:6": "And the sons of Jacob, knowing that the Lord had brought a spirit of perverseness amongst those men, and that they fought each man with his neighbor, went forth from among the bands of the people of Bethchorin and went as far as the descent of the castle of Bethchorin, and farther, and they tarried there securely with their young men on that night.",
        "40:7": "And the people of Bethchorin fought the whole night, one man with his brother, and the other with his neighbor, and they cried out in every direction upon the castle, and their cry was heard at a distance, and the whole earth shook at their voice, for they were powerful above all the people of the earth.",
        "40:8": "And all the inhabitants of the cities of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Hivites and all the kings of Canaan, and also those who were on the other side of the Jordan, heard the noise of the shouting on that night.",
        "40:9": "And they said, Surely these are the battles of the Hebrews who are fighting against the seven cities, who came nigh unto them; and who can stand against those Hebrews?",
        "40:10": "And all the inhabitants of the cities of the Canaanites, and all those who were on the other side of the Jordan, were greatly afraid of the sons of Jacob, for they said, Behold the same will be done to us as was done to those cities, for who can stand against their mighty strength?",
        "40:11": "And the cries of the Chorinites were very great on that night, and continued to increase; and they smote each other till morning, and numbers of them were killed.",
        "40:12": "And the morning appeared, and all the sons of Jacob rose up at daybreak and went up to the castle, and they smote those who remained of the Chorinites in a terrible manner, and they were all killed in the castle.",
        "40:13": "And the sixth day appeared, and all the inhabitants of Canaan saw at a distance all the people of Bethchorin lying dead in the castle of Bethchorin, and strewed about as the carcasses of lambs and goats.",
        "40:14": "And the sons of Jacob led all the spoil which they had captured from Gaash and went to Bethchorin, and they found the city full of people like the sand of the sea, and they fought with them, and the sons of Jacob smote them there till evening time.",
        "40:15": "And the sons of Jacob did unto Bethchorin as they had done to Gaash and Tapnach, and as they had done to Chazar, to Sarton and to Shiloh.",
        "40:16": "And the sons of Jacob took with them the spoil of Bethchorin and all the spoil of the cities, and on that day they went home to Shechem.",
        "40:17": "And the sons of Jacob came home to the city of Shechem, and they remained without the city, and they then rested there from the war, and tarried there all night.",
        "40:18": "And all their servants together with all the spoil that they had taken from the cities, they left without the city, and they did not enter the city, for they said, Peradventure there may be yet more fighting against us, and they may come to besiege us in Shechem.",
        "40:19": "And Jacob and his sons and their servants remained on that night and the next day in the portion of the field which Jacob had purchased from Hamor for five shekels, and all that they had captured was with them.",
        "40:20": "And all the booty which the sons of Jacob had captured, was in the portion of the field, immense as the sand upon the sea shore.",
        "40:21": "And the inhabitants of the land observed them from afar, and all the inhabitants of the land were afraid of the sons of Jacob who had done this thing, for no king from the days of old had ever done the like.",
        "40:22": "And the seven kings of the Canaanites resolved to make peace with the sons of Jacob, for they were greatly afraid of their lives, on account of the sons of Jacob.",
        "40:23": "And on that day, being the seventh day, Japhia king of Hebron sent secretly to the king of Ai, and to the king of Gibeon, and to the king of Shalem, and to the king of Adulam, and to the king of Lachish, and to the king of Chazar, and to all the Canaanitish kings who were under their subjection, saying,",
        "40:24": "Go up with me, and come to me that we may go to the sons of Jacob, and I will make peace with them, and form a treaty with them, lest all your lands be destroyed by the swords of the sons of Jacob, as they did to Shechem and the cities around it, as you have heard and seen.",
        "40:25": "And when you come to me, do not come with many men, but let every king bring his three head captains, and every captain bring three of his officers.",
        "40:26": "And come all of you to Hebron, and we will go together to the sons of Jacob, and supplicate them that they shall form a treaty of peace with us.",
        "40:27": "And all those kings did as the king of Hebron had sent to them, for they were all under his counsel and command, and all the kings of Canaan assembled to go to the sons of Jacob, to make peace with them; and the sons of Jacob returned and went to the portion of the field that was in Shechem, for they did not put confidence in the kings of the land.",
        "40:28": "And the sons of Jacob returned and remained in the portion of the field ten days, and no one came to make war with them.",
        "40:29": "And when the sons of Jacob saw that there was no appearance of war, they all assembled and went to the city of Shechem, and the sons of Jacob remained in Shechem.",
        "40:30": "And at the expiration of forty days, all the kings of the Amorites assembled from all their places and came to Hebron, to Japhia, king of Hebron.",
        "40:31": "And the number of kings that came to Hebron, to make peace with the sons of Jacob, was twenty-one kings, and the number of captains that came with them was sixty-nine, and their men were one hundred and eighty-nine, and all these kings and their men rested by Mount Hebron.",
        "40:32": "And the king of Hebron went out with his three captains and nine men, and these kings resolved to go to the sons of Jacob to make peace.",
        "40:33": "And they said unto the king of Hebron, Go thou before us with thy men, and speak for us unto the sons of Jacob, and we will come after thee and confirm thy words, and the king of Hebron did so.",
        "40:34": "And the sons of Jacob heard that all the kings of Canaan had gathered together and rested in Hebron, and the sons of Jacob sent four of their servants as spies, saying, Go and spy these kings, and search and examine their men whether they are few or many, and if they are but few in number, number them all and come back.",
        "40:35": "And the servants of Jacob went secretly to these kings, and did as the sons of Jacob had commanded them, and on that day they came back to the sons of Jacob, and said unto them, We came unto those kings, and they are but few in number, and we numbered them all, and behold, they were two hundred and eighty-eight, kings and men.",
        "40:36": "And the sons of Jacob said, They are but few in number, therefore we will not all go out to them; and in the morning the sons of Jacob rose up and chose sixty two of their men, and ten of the sons of Jacob went with them; and they girt on their weapons of war, for they said, They are coming to make war with us, for they knew not that they were coming to make peace with them.",
        "40:37": "And the sons of Jacob went with their servants to the gate of Shechem, toward those kings, and their father Jacob was with them.",
        "40:38": "And when they had come forth, behold, the king of Hebron and his three captains and nine men with him were coming along the road against the sons of Jacob, and the sons of Jacob lifted up their eyes, and saw at a distance Japhia, king of Hebron, with his captains, coming toward them, and the sons of Jacob took their stand at the place of the gate of Shechem, and did not proceed.",
        "40:39": "And the king of Hebron continued to advance, he and his captains, until he came nigh to the sons of Jacob, and he and his captains bowed down to them to the ground, and the king of Hebron sat with his captains before Jacob and his sons.",
        "40:40": "And the sons of Jacob said unto him, What has befallen thee, O king of Hebron? why hast thou come to us this day? what dost thou require from us? and the king of Hebron said unto Jacob, I beseech thee my lord, all the kings of the Canaanites have this day come to make peace with you.",
        "40:41": "And the sons of Jacob heard the words of the king of Hebron, and they would not consent to his proposals, for the sons of Jacob had no faith in him, for they imagined that the king of Hebron had spoken deceitfully to them.",
        "40:42": "And the king of Hebron knew from the words of the sons of Jacob, that they did not believe his words, and the king of Hebron approached nearer to Jacob, and said unto him, I beseech thee, my lord, to be assured that all these kings have come to you on peaceable terms, for they have not come with all their men, neither did they bring their weapons of war with them, for they have come to seek peace from my lord and his sons.",
        "40:43": "And the sons of Jacob answered the king of Hebron, saying, Send thou to all these kings, and if thou speakest truth unto us, let them each come singly before us, and if they come unto us unarmed, we shall then know that they seek peace from us.",
        "40:44": "And Japhia, king of Hebron, sent one of his men to the kings, and they all came before the sons of Jacob, and bowed down to them to the ground, and these kings sat before Jacob and his sons, and they spoke unto them, saying,",
        "40:45": "We have heard all that you did unto the kings of the Amorites with your sword and exceedingly mighty arm, so that no man could stand up before you, and we were afraid of you for the sake of our lives, lest it should befall us as it did to them.",
        "40:46": "So we have come unto you to form a treaty of peace between us, and now therefore contract with us a covenant of peace and truth, that you will not meddle with us, inasmuch as we have not meddled with you.",
        "40:47": "And the sons of Jacob knew that they had really come to seek peace from them, and the sons of Jacob listened to them, and formed a covenant with them.",
        "40:48": "And the sons of Jacob swore unto them that they would not meddle with them, and all the kings of the Canaanites swore also to them, and the sons of Jacob made them tributary from that day forward.",
        "40:49": "And after this all the captains of these kings came with their men before Jacob, with presents in their hands for Jacob and his sons, and they bowed down to him to the ground.",
        "40:50": "And these kings then urged the sons of Jacob and begged of them to return all the spoil they had captured from the seven cities of the Amorites, and the sons of Jacob did so, and they returned all that they had captured, the women, the little ones, the cattle and all the spoil which they had taken, and they sent them off, and they went away each to his city.",
        "40:51": "And all these kings again bowed down to the sons of Jacob, and they sent or brought them many gifts in those days, and the sons of Jacob sent off these kings and their men, and they went peaceably away from them to their cities, and the sons of Jacob also returned to their home, to Shechem.",
        "40:52": "And there was peace from that day forward between the sons of Jacob and the kings of the Canaanites, until the children of Israel came to inherit the land of Canaan.",
        "41:1": "And at the revolution of the year the sons of Jacob journeyed from Shechem, and they came to Hebron, to their father Isaac, and they dwelt there, but their flocks and herds they fed daily in Shechem, for there was there in those days good and fat pasture, and Jacob and his sons and all their household dwelt in the valley of Hebron.",
        "41:2": "And it was in those days, in that year, being the hundred and sixth year of the life of Jacob, in the tenth year of Jacob's coming from Padan-aram, that Leah the wife of Jacob died; she was fifty-one years old when she died in Hebron.",
        "41:3": "And Jacob and his sons buried her in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which is in Hebron, which Abraham had bought from the children of Heth, for the possession of a burial place.",
        "41:4": "And the sons of Jacob dwelt with their father in the valley of Hebron, and all the inhabitants of the land knew their strength and their fame went throughout the land.",
        "41:5": "And Joseph the son of Jacob, and his brother Benjamin, the sons of Rachel, the wife of Jacob, were yet young in those days, and did not go out with their brethren during their battles in all the cities of the Amorites.",
        "41:6": "And when Joseph saw the strength of his brethren, and their greatness, he praised them and extolled them, but he ranked himself greater than them, and extolled himself above them; and Jacob, his father, also loved him more than any of his sons, for he was a son of his old age, and through his love toward him, he made him a coat of many colors.",
        "41:7": "And when Joseph saw that his father loved him more than his brethren, he continued to exalt himself above his brethren, and he brought unto his father evil reports concerning them.",
        "41:8": "And the sons of Jacob seeing the whole of Joseph's conduct toward them, and that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and could not speak peaceably to him all the days.",
        "41:9": "And Joseph was seventeen years old, and he was still magnifying himself above his brethren, and thought of raising himself above them.",
        "41:10": "At that time he dreamed a dream, and he came unto his brothers and told them his dream, and he said unto them, I dreamed a dream, and behold we were all binding sheaves in the field, and my sheaf rose and placed itself upon the ground and your sheaves surrounded it and bowed down to it.",
        "41:11": "And his brethren answered him and said unto him, What meaneth this dream that thou didst dream? dost thou imagine in thy heart to reign or rule over us?",
        "41:12": "And he still came, and told the thing to his father Jacob, and Jacob kissed Joseph when he heard these words from his mouth, and Jacob blessed Joseph.",
        "41:13": "And when the sons of Jacob saw that their father had blessed Joseph and had kissed him, and that he loved him exceedingly, they became jealous of him and hated him the more.",
        "41:14": "And after this Joseph dreamed another dream and related the dream to his father in the presence of his brethren, and Joseph said unto his father and brethren, Behold I have again dreamed a dream, and behold the sun and the moon and the eleven stars bowed down to me.",
        "41:15": "And his father heard the words of Joseph and his dream, and seeing that his brethren hated Joseph on account of this matter, Jacob therefore rebuked Joseph before his brethren on account of this thing, saying, What meaneth this dream which thou hast dreamed, and this magnifying thyself before thy brethren who are older than thou art?",
        "41:16": "Dost thou imagine in thy heart that I and thy mother and thy eleven brethren will come and bow down to thee, that thou speakest these things?",
        "41:17": "And his brethren were jealous of him on account of his words and dreams, and they continued to hate him, and Jacob reserved the dreams in his heart.",
        "41:18": "And the sons of Jacob went one day to feed their father's flock in Shechem, for they were still herdsmen in those days; and whilst the sons of Jacob were that day feeding in Shechem they delayed, and the time of gathering in the cattle was passed, and they had not arrived.",
        "41:19": "And Jacob saw that his sons were delayed in Shechem, and Jacob said within himself, Peradventure the people of Shechem have risen up to fight against them, therefore they have delayed coming this day.",
        "41:20": "And Jacob called Joseph his son and commanded him, saying, Behold thy brethren are feeding in Shechem this day, and behold they have not yet come back; go now therefore and see where they are, and bring me word back concerning the welfare of thy brethren and the welfare of the flock.",
        "41:21": "And Jacob sent his son Joseph to the valley of Hebron, and Joseph came for his brothers to Shechem, and could not find them, and Joseph went about the field which was near Shechem, to see where his brothers had turned, and he missed his road in the wilderness, and knew not which way he should go.",
        "41:22": "And an angel of the Lord found him wandering in the road toward the field, and Joseph said unto the angel of the Lord, I seek my brethren; hast thou not heard where they are feeding? and the angel of the Lord said unto Joseph, I saw thy brethren feeding here, and I heard them say they would go to feed in Dothan.",
        "41:23": "And Joseph hearkened to the voice of the angel of the Lord, and he went to his brethren in Dothan and he found them in Dothan feeding the flock.",
        "41:24": "And Joseph advanced to his brethren, and before he had come nigh unto them, they had resolved to slay him.",
        "41:25": "And Simeon said to his brethren, Behold the man of dreams is coming unto us this day, and now therefore come and let us kill him and cast him in one of the pits that are in the wilderness, and when his father shall seek him from us, we will say an evil beast has devoured him.",
        "41:26": "And Reuben heard the words of his brethren concerning Joseph, and he said unto them, You should not do this thing, for how can we look up to our father Jacob? Cast him into this pit to die there, but stretch not forth a hand upon him to spill his blood; and Reuben said this in order to deliver him from their hand, to bring him back to his father.",
        "41:27": "And when Joseph came to his brethren he sat before them, and they rose upon him and seized him and smote him to the earth, and stripped the coat of many colors which he had on.",
        "41:28": "And they took him and cast him into a pit, and in the pit there was no water, but serpents and scorpions. And Joseph was afraid of the serpents and scorpions that were in the pit. And Joseph cried out with a loud voice, and the Lord hid the serpents and scorpions in the sides of the pit, and they did no harm unto Joseph.",
        "41:29": "And Joseph called out from the pit to his brethren, and said unto them, What have I done unto you, and in what have I sinned? why do you not fear the Lord concerning me? am I not of your bones and flesh, and is not Jacob your father, my father? why do you do this thing unto me this day, and how will you be able to look up to our father Jacob?",
        "41:30": "And he continued to cry out and call unto his brethren from the pit, and he said, O Judah, Simeon, and Levi, my brethren, lift me up from the place of darkness in which you have placed me, and come this day to have compassion on me, ye children of the Lord, and sons of Jacob my father. And if I have sinned unto you, are you not the sons of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob? if they saw an orphan they had compassion over him, or one that was hungry, they gave him bread to eat, or one that was thirsty, they gave him water to drink, or one that was naked, they covered him with garments!",
        "41:31": "And how then will you withhold your pity from your brother, for I am of your flesh and bones, and if I have sinned unto you, surely you will do this on account of my father!",
        "41:32": "And Joseph spoke these words from the pit, and his brethren could not listen to him, nor incline their ears to the words of Joseph, and Joseph was crying and weeping in the pit.",
        "41:33": "And Joseph said, O that my father knew, this day, the act which my brothers have done unto me, and the words which they have this day spoken unto me.",
        "41:34": "And all his brethren heard his cries and weeping in the pit, and his brethren went and removed themselves from the pit, so that they might not hear the cries of Joseph and his weeping in the pit.",
        "42:1": "And they went and sat on the opposite side, about the distance of a bow-shot, and they sat there to eat bread, and whilst they were eating, they held counsel together what was to be done with him, whether to slay him or to bring him back to his father.",
        "42:2": "They were holding the counsel, when they lifted up their eyes, and saw, and behold there was a company of Ishmaelites coming at a distance by the road of Gilead, going down to Egypt.",
        "42:3": "And Judah said unto them, What gain will it be to us if we slay our brother? peradventure God will require him from us; this then is the counsel proposed concerning him, which you shall do unto him: Behold this company of Ishmaelites going down to Egypt,",
        "42:4": "Now therefore, come let us dispose of him to them, and let not our hand be upon him, and they will lead him along with them, and he will be lost amongst the people of the land, and we will not put him to death with our own hands. And the proposal pleased his brethren and they did according to the word of Judah.",
        "42:5": "And whilst they were discoursing about this matter, and before the company of Ishmaelites had come up to them, seven trading men of Midian passed by them, and as they passed they were thirsty, and they lifted up their eyes and saw the pit in which Joseph was immured, and they looked, and behold every species of bird was upon him.",
        "42:6": "And these Midianites ran to the pit to drink water, for they thought that it contained water, and on coming before the pit they heard the voice of Joseph crying and weeping in the pit, and they looked down into the pit, and they saw and behold there was a youth of comely appearance and well favored.",
        "42:7": "And they called unto him and said, Who art thou and who brought thee hither, and who placed thee in this pit, in the wilderness? and they all assisted to raise up Joseph and they drew him out, and brought him up from the pit, and took him and went away on their journey and passed by his brethren.",
        "42:8": "And these said unto them, Why do you do this, to take our servant from us and to go away? surely we placed this youth in the pit because he rebelled against us, and you come and bring him up and lead him away; now then give us back our servant.",
        "42:9": "And the Midianites answered and said unto the sons of Jacob, Is this your servant, or does this man attend you? peradventure you are all his servants, for he is more comely and well favored than any of you, and why do you all speak falsely unto us?",
        "42:10": "Now therefore we will not listen to your words, nor attend to you, for we found the youth in the pit in the wilderness, and we took him; we will therefore go on.",
        "42:11": "And all the sons of Jacob approached them and rose up to them and said unto them, Give us back our servant, and why will you all die by the edge of the sword? And the Midianites cried out against them, and they drew their swords, and approached to fight with the sons of Jacob.",
        "42:12": "And behold Simeon rose up from his seat against them, and sprang upon the ground and drew his sword and approached the Midianites and he gave a terrible shout before them, so that his shouting was heard at a distance, and the earth shook at Simeon's shouting.",
        "42:13": "And the Midianites were terrified on account of Simeon and the noise of his shouting, and they fell upon their faces, and were excessively alarmed.",
        "42:14": "And Simeon said unto them, Verily I am Simeon, the son of Jacob the Hebrew, who have, only with my brother, destroyed the city of Shechem and the cities of the Amorites; so shall God moreover do unto me, that if all your brethren the people of Midian, and also the kings of Canaan, were to come with you, they could not fight against me.",
        "42:15": "Now therefore give us back the youth whom you have taken, lest I give your flesh to the birds of the skies and the beasts of the earth.",
        "42:16": "And the Midianites were more afraid of Simeon, and they approached the sons of Jacob with terror and fright, and with pathetic words, saying,",
        "42:17": "Surely you have said that the young man is your servant, and that he rebelled against you, and therefore you placed him in the pit; what then will you do with a servant who rebels against his master? Now therefore sell him unto us, and we will give you all that you require for him; and the Lord was pleased to do this in order that the sons of Jacob should not slay their brother.",
        "42:18": "And the Midianites saw that Joseph was of a comely appearance and well-favored; they desired him in their hearts and were urgent to purchase him from his brethren.",
        "42:19": "And the sons of Jacob hearkened to the Midianites and they sold their brother Joseph to them for twenty pieces of silver, and Reuben their brother was not with them, and the Midianites took Joseph and continued their journey to Gilead.",
        "42:20": "They were going along the road, and the Midianites repented of what they had done, in having purchased the young man, and one said to the other, What is this thing that we have done, in taking this youth from the Hebrews, who is of comely appearance and well favored.",
        "42:21": "Perhaps this youth is stolen from the land of the Hebrews, and why then have we done this thing? and if he should be sought for and found in our hands we shall die through him.",
        "42:22": "Now surely hardy and powerful men have sold him to us, the strength of one of whom you saw this day; perhaps they stole him from his land with their might and with their powerful arm, and have therefore sold him to us for the small value which we gave unto them.",
        "42:23": "And whilst they were thus discoursing together, they looked, and behold the company of Ishmaelites which was coming at first, and which the sons of Jacob saw, was advancing toward the Midianites, and the Midianites said to each other, Come let us sell this youth to the company of Ishmaelites who are coming toward us, and we will take for him the little that we gave for him, and we will be delivered from his evil.",
        "42:24": "And they did so, and they reached the Ishmaelites, and the Midianites sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver which they had given for him to his brethren.",
        "42:25": "And the Midianites went on their road to Gilead, and the Ishmaelites took Joseph and they let him ride upon one of the camels, and they were leading him to Egypt.",
        "42:26": "And Joseph heard that the Ishmaelites were proceeding to Egypt, and Joseph lamented and wept at this thing that he was to be so far removed from the land of Canaan, from his father, and he wept bitterly whilst he was riding upon the camel, and one of their men observed him, and made him go down from the camel and walk on foot, and notwithstanding this Joseph continued to cry and weep, and he said, O my father, my father.",
        "42:27": "And one of the Ishmaelites rose up and smote Joseph upon the cheek, and still he continued to weep; and Joseph was fatigued in the road, and was unable to proceed on account of the bitterness of his soul, and they all smote him and afflicted him in the road, and they terrified him in order that he might cease from weeping.",
        "42:28": "And the Lord saw the ambition of Joseph and his trouble, and the Lord brought down upon those men darkness and confusion, and the hand of every one that smote him became withered.",
        "42:29": "And they said to each other, What is this thing that God has done to us in the road? and they knew not that this befell them on account of Joseph. And the men proceeded on the road, and they passed along the road of Ephrath where Rachel was buried.",
        "42:30": "And Joseph reached his mother's grave, and Joseph hastened and ran to his mother's grave, and fell upon the grave and wept.",
        "42:31": "And Joseph cried aloud upon his mother's grave, and he said, O my mother, my mother, O thou who didst give me birth, awake now, and rise and see thy son, how he has been sold for a slave, and no one to pity him.",
        "42:32": "O rise and see thy son, weep with me on account of my troubles, and see the heart of my brethren.",
        "42:33": "Arouse my mother, arouse, awake from thy sleep for me, and direct thy battles against my brethren. O how have they stripped me of my coat, and sold me already twice for a slave, and separated me from my father, and there is no one to pity me.",
        "42:34": "Arouse and lay thy cause against them before God, and see whom God will justify in the judgment, and whom he will condemn.",
        "42:35": "Rise, O my mother, rise, awake from thy sleep and see my father how his soul is with me this day, and comfort him and ease his heart.",
        "42:36": "And Joseph continued to speak these words, and Joseph cried aloud and wept bitterly upon his mother's grave; and he ceased speaking, and from bitterness of heart he became still as a stone upon the grave.",
        "42:37": "And Joseph heard a voice speaking to him from beneath the ground, which answered him with bitterness of heart, and with a voice of weeping and praying in these words:",
        "42:38": "My son, my son Joseph, I have heard the voice of thy weeping and the voice of thy lamentation; I have seen thy tears; I know thy troubles, my son, and it grieves me for thy sake, and abundant grief is added to my grief.",
        "42:39": "Now therefore my son, Joseph my son, hope to the Lord, and wait for him and do not fear, for the Lord is with thee, he will deliver thee from all trouble.",
        "42:40": "Rise my son, go down unto Egypt with thy masters, and do not fear, for the Lord is with thee, my son. And she continued to speak like unto these words unto Joseph, and she was still.",
        "42:41": "And Joseph heard this, and he wondered greatly at this, and he continued to weep; and after this one of the Ishmaelites observed him crying and weeping upon the grave, and his anger was kindled against him, and he drove him from there, and he smote him and cursed him.",
        "42:42": "And Joseph said unto the men, May I find grace in your sight to take me back to my father's house, and he will give you abundance of riches.",
        "42:43": "And they answered him, saying, Art thou not a slave, and where is thy father? and if thou hadst a father thou wouldst not already twice have been sold for a slave for so little value; and their anger was still roused against him, and they continued to smite him and to chastise him, and Joseph wept bitterly.",
        "42:44": "And the Lord saw Joseph's affliction, and Lord again smote these men, and chastised them, and the Lord caused darkness to envelope them upon the earth, and the lightning flashed and the thunder roared, and the earth shook at the voice of the thunder and of the mighty wind, and the men were terrified and knew not where they should go.",
        "42:45": "And the beasts and camels stood still, and they led them, but they would not go, they smote them, and they crouched upon the ground; and the men said to each other, What is this that God has done to us? what are our transgressions, and what are our sins that this thing has thus befallen us?",
        "42:46": "And one of them answered and said unto them, Perhaps on account of the sin of afflicting this slave has this thing happened this day to us; now therefore implore him strongly to forgive us, and then we shall know on whose account this evil befalleth us, and if God shall have compassion over us, then we shall know that all this cometh to us on account of the sin of afflicting this slave.",
        "42:47": "And the men did so, and they supplicated Joseph and pressed him to forgive them; and they said, We have sinned to the Lord and to thee, now therefore vouchsafe to request of thy God that he shall put away this death from amongst us, for we have sinned to him.",
        "42:48": "And Joseph did according to their words, and the Lord hearkened to Joseph, and the Lord put away the plague which he had inflicted upon those men on account of Joseph, and the beasts rose up from the ground and they conducted them, and they went on, and the raging storm abated and the earth became tranquilized, and the men proceeded on their journey to go down to Egypt, and the men knew that this evil had befallen them on account of Joseph.",
        "42:49": "And they said to each other, Behold we know that it was on account of his affliction that this evil befell us; now therefore why shall we bring this death upon our souls? Let us hold counsel what to do to this slave.",
        "42:50": "And one answered and said, Surely he told us to bring him back to his father; now therefore come, let us take him back and we will go to the place that he will tell us, and take from his family the price that we gave for him and we will then go away.",
        "42:51": "And one answered again and said, Behold this counsel is very good, but we cannot do so for the way is very far from us, and we cannot go out of our road.",
        "42:52": "And one more answered and said unto them, This is the counsel to be adopted, we will not swerve from it; behold we are this day going to Egypt, and when we shall have come to Egypt, we will sell him there at a high price, and we will be delivered from his evil.",
        "42:53": "And this thing pleased the men and they did so, and they continued their journey to Egypt with Joseph.",
        "43:1": "And when the sons of Jacob had sold their brother Joseph to the Midianites, their hearts were smitten on account of him, and they repented of their acts, and they sought for him to bring him back, but could not find him.",
        "43:2": "And Reuben returned to the pit in which Joseph had been put, in order to lift him out, and restore him to his father, and Reuben stood by the pit, and he heard not a word, and he called out Joseph! Joseph! and no one answered or uttered a word.",
        "43:3": "And Reuben said, Joseph has died through fright, or some serpent has caused his death; and Reuben descended into the pit, and he searched for Joseph and could not find him in the pit, and he came out again.",
        "43:4": "And Reuben tore his garments and he said, The child is not there, and how shall I reconcile my father about him if he be dead? and he went to his brethren and found them grieving on account of Joseph, and counseling together how to reconcile their father about him, and Reuben said unto his brethren, I came to the pit and behold Joseph was not there, what then shall we say unto our father, for my father will only seek the lad from me.",
        "43:5": "And his brethren answered him saying, Thus and thus we did, and our hearts afterward smote us on account of this act, and we now sit to seek a pretext how we shall reconcile our father to it.",
        "43:6": "And Reuben said unto them, What is this you have done to bring down the grey hairs of our father in sorrow to the grave? the thing is not good, that you have done.",
        "43:7": "And Reuben sat with them, and they all rose up and swore to each other not to tell this thing unto Jacob, and they all said, The man who will tell this to our father or his household, or who will report this to any of the children of the land, we will all rise up against him and slay him with the sword.",
        "43:8": "And the sons of Jacob feared each other in this matter, from the youngest to the oldest, and no one spoke a word, and they concealed the thing in their hearts.",
        "43:9": "And they afterward sat down to determine and invent something to say unto their father Jacob concerning all these things.",
        "43:10": "And Issachar said unto them, Here is an advice for you if it seem good in your eyes to do this thing, take the coat which belongeth to Joseph and tear it, and kill a kid of the goats and dip it in its blood.",
        "43:11": "And send it to our father and when he seeth it he will say an evil beast has devoured him, therefore tear ye his coat and behold his blood will be upon his coat, and by your doing this we shall be free of our father's murmurings.",
        "43:12": "And Issachar's advice pleased them, and they hearkened unto him and they did according to the word of Issachar which he had counselled them.",
        "43:13": "And they hastened and took Joseph's coat and tore it, and they killed a kid of the goats and dipped the coat in the blood of the kid, and then trampled it in the dust, and they sent the coat to their father Jacob by the hand of Naphtali, and they commanded him to say these words:",
        "43:14": "We had gathered in the cattle and had come as far as the road to Shechem and farther, when we found this coat upon the road in the wilderness dipped in blood and in dust; now therefore know whether it be thy son's coat or not.",
        "43:15": "And Naphtali went and he came unto his father and he gave him the coat, and he spoke unto him all the words which his brethren had commanded him.",
        "43:16": "And Jacob saw Joseph's coat and he knew it and he fell upon his face to the ground, and became as still as a stone, and he afterward rose up and cried out with a loud and weeping voice and he said, It is the coat of my son Joseph!",
        "43:17": "And Jacob hastened and sent one of his servants to his sons, who went to them and found them coming along the road with the flock.",
        "43:18": "And the sons of Jacob came to their father about evening, and behold their garments were torn and dust was upon their heads, and they found their father crying out and weeping with a loud voice.",
        "43:19": "And Jacob said unto his sons, Tell me truly what evil have you this day suddenly brought upon me? and they answered their father Jacob, saying, We were coming along this day after the flock had been gathered in, and we came as far as the city of Shechem by the road in the wilderness, and we found this coat filled with blood upon the ground, and we knew it and we sent unto thee if thou couldst know it.",
        "43:20": "And Jacob heard the words of his sons and he cried out with a loud voice, and he said, It is the coat of my son, an evil beast has devoured him; Joseph is rent in pieces, for I sent him this day to see whether it was well with you and well with the flocks and to bring me word again from you, and he went as I commanded him, and this has happened to him this day whilst I thought my son was with you.",
        "43:21": "And the sons of Jacob answered and said, He did not come to us, neither have we seen him from the time of our going out from thee until now.",
        "43:22": "And when Jacob heard their words he again cried out aloud, and he rose up and tore his garments, and he put sackcloth upon his loins, and he wept bitterly and he mourned and lifted up his voice in weeping and exclaimed and said these words,",
        "43:23": "Joseph my son, O my son Joseph, I sent thee this day after the welfare of thy brethren, and behold thou hast been torn in pieces; through my hand has this happened to my son.",
        "43:24": "It grieves me for thee Joseph my son, it grieves me for thee; how sweet wast thou to me during life, and now how exceedingly bitter is thy death to me.",
        "43:25": "0 that I had died in thy stead Joseph my son, for it grieves me sadly for thee my son, O my son, my son. Joseph my son, where art thou, and where hast thou been drawn? arouse, arouse from thy place, and come and see my grief for thee, O my son Joseph.",
        "43:26": "Come now and number the tears gushing from my eyes down my cheeks, and bring them up before the Lord, that his anger may turn from me.",
        "43:27": "0 Joseph my son, how didst thou fall, by the hand of one by whom no one had fallen from the beginning of the world unto this day; for thou hast been put to death by the smiting of an enemy, inflicted with cruelty, but surely I know that this has happened to thee, on account of the multitude of my sins.",
        "43:28": "Arouse now and see how bitter is my trouble for thee my son, although I did not rear thee, nor fashion thee, nor give thee breath and soul, but it was God who formed thee and built thy bones and covered them with flesh, and breathed in thy nostrils the breath of life, and then he gave thee unto me.",
        "43:29": "Now truly God who gave thee unto me, he has taken thee from me, and such then has befallen thee",
        "43:30": "And Jacob continued to speak like unto these words concerning Joseph, and he wept bitterly; he fell to the ground and became still.",
        "43:31": "And all the sons of Jacob seeing their father's trouble, they repented of what they had done, and they also wept bitterly.",
        "43:32": "And Judah rose up and lifted his father's head from the ground, and placed it upon his lap, and he wiped his father's tears from his cheeks, and Judah wept an exceeding great weeping, whilst his father's head was reclining upon his lap, still as a stone.",
        "43:33": "And the sons of Jacob saw their father's trouble, and they lifted up their voices and continued to weep, and Jacob was yet lying upon the ground still as a stone.",
        "43:34": "And all his sons and his servants and his servant's children rose up and stood round him to comfort him, and he refused to be comforted.",
        "43:35": "And the whole household of Jacob rose up and mourned a great mourning on account of Joseph and their father's trouble, and the intelligence reached Isaac, the son of Abraham, the father of Jacob, and he wept bitterly on account of Joseph, he and all his household, and he went from the place where he dwelt in Hebron, and his men with him, and he comforted Jacob his son, and he refused to be comforted.",
        "43:36": "And after this, Jacob rose up from the ground, and his tears were running down his cheeks, and he said unto his sons, Rise up and take your swords and your bows, and go forth into the field, and seek whether you can find my son's body and bring it unto me that I may bury it.",
        "43:37": "Seek also, I pray you, among the beasts and hunt them, and that which shall come the first before you seize and bring it unto me, perhaps the Lord will this day pity my affliction, and prepare before you that which did tear my son in pieces, and bring it unto me, and I will avenge the cause of my son.",
        "43:38": "And his sons did as their father had commanded them, and they rose up early in the morning, and each took his sword and his bow in his hand, and they went forth into the field to hunt the beasts.",
        "43:39": "And Jacob was still crying aloud and weeping and walking to and fro in the house, and smiting his hands together, saying, Joseph my son, Joseph my son.",
        "43:40": "And the sons of Jacob went into the wilderness to seize the beasts, and behold a wolf came toward them, and they seized him, and brought him unto their father, and they said unto him, This is the first we have found, and we have brought him unto thee as thou didst command us, and thy son's body we could not find.",
        "43:41": "And Jacob took the beast from the hands of his sons, and he cried out with a loud and weeping voice, holding the beast in his hand, and he spoke with a bitter heart unto the beast, Why didst thou devour my son Joseph, and how didst thou have no fear of the God of the earth, or of my trouble for my son Joseph?",
        "43:42": "And thou didst devour my son for naught, because he committed no violence, and didst thereby render me culpable on his account, therefore God will require him that is persecuted.",
        "43:43": "And the Lord opened the mouth of the beast in order to comfort Jacob with its words, and it answered Jacob and spoke these words unto him,",
        "43:44": "As God liveth who created us in the earth, and as thy soul liveth, my lord, I did not see thy son, neither did I tear him to pieces, but from a distant land I also came to seek my son who went from me this day, and I know not whether he be living or dead.",
        "43:45": "And I came this day into the field to seek my son, and your sons found me, and seized me and increased my grief, and have this day brought me before thee, and I have now spoken all my words to thee.",
        "43:46": "And now therefore, O son of man, I am in thy hands, and do unto me this day as it may seem good in thy sight, but by the life of God who created me, I did not see thy son, nor did I tear him to pieces, neither has the flesh of man entered my mouth all the days of my life.",
        "43:47": "And when Jacob heard the words of the beast he was greatly astonished, and sent forth the beast from his hand, and she went her way.",
        "43:48": "And Jacob was still crying aloud and weeping for Joseph day after day, and he mourned for his son many days.",
        "44:1": "And the sons of Ishmael who had bought Joseph from the Midianites, who had bought him from his brethren, went to Egypt with Joseph, and they came upon the borders of Egypt, and when they came near unto Egypt, they met four men of the sons of Medan the son of Abraham, who had gone forth from the land of Egypt on their journey.",
        "44:2": "And the Ishmaelites said unto them, Do you desire to purchase this slave from us? and they said, Deliver him over to us, and they delivered Joseph over to them, and they beheld him, that he was a very comely youth and they purchased him for twenty shekels.",
        "44:3": "And the Ishmaelites continued their journey to Egypt and the Medanim also returned that day to Egypt, and the Medanim said to each other, Behold we have heard that Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, seeketh a good servant who shall stand before him to attend him, and to make him overseer over his house and all belonging to him.",
        "44:4": "Now therefore come let us sell him to him for what we may desire, if he be able to give unto us that which we shall require for him.",
        "44:5": "And these Medanim went and came to the house of Potiphar, and said unto him, We have heard that thou seekest a good servant to attend thee, behold we have a servant that will please thee, if thou canst give unto us that which we may desire, and we will sell him unto thee.",
        "44:6": "And Potiphar said, Bring him before me, and I will see him, and if he please me I will give unto you that which you may require for him.",
        "44:7": "And the Medanim went and brought Joseph and placed him before Potiphar, and he saw him, and he pleased him exceedingly, and Potiphar said unto them, Tell me what you require for this youth?",
        "44:8": "And they said, Four hundred pieces of silver we desire for him, and Potiphar said, I will give it you if you bring me the record of his sale to you, and will tell me his history, for perhaps he may be stolen, for this youth is neither a slave, nor the son of a slave, but I observe in him the appearance of a goodly and handsome person.",
        "44:9": "And the Medanim went and brought unto him the Ishmaelites who had sold him to them, and they told him, saying, He is a slave and we sold him to them.",
        "44:10": "And Potiphar heard the words of the Ishmaelites in his giving the silver unto the Medanim, and the Medanim took the silver and went on their journey, and the Ishmaelites also returned home.",
        "44:11": "And Potiphar took Joseph and brought him to his house that he might serve him, and Joseph found favor in the sight of Potiphar, and he placed confidence in him, and made him overseer over his house, and all that belonged to him he delivered over into his hand.",
        "44:12": "And the Lord was with Joseph and he became a prosperous man, and the Lord blessed the house of Potiphar for the sake of Joseph.",
        "44:13": "And Potiphar left all that he had in the hand of Joseph, and Joseph was one that caused things to come in and go out, and everything was regulated by his wish in the house of Potiphar.",
        "44:14": "And Joseph was eighteen years old, a youth with beautiful eyes and of comely appearance, and like unto him was not in the whole land of Egypt.",
        "44:15": "At that time whilst he was in his master's house, going in and out of the house and attending his master, Zelicah, his master's wife, lifted up her eyes toward Joseph and she looked at him, and behold he was a youth comely and well favored.",
        "44:16": "And she coveted his beauty in her heart, and her soul was fixed upon Joseph, and she enticed him day after day, and Zelicah persuaded Joseph daily, but Joseph did not lift up his eyes to behold his master's wife.",
        "44:17": "And Zelicah said unto him, How goodly are thy appearance and form, truly I have looked at all the slaves, and have not seen so beautiful a slave as thou art; and Joseph said unto her, Surely he who created me in my mother's womb created all mankind.",
        "44:18": "And she said unto him, How beautiful are thine eyes, with which thou hast dazzled all the inhabitants of Egypt, men and women; and he said unto her, How beautiful they are whilst we are alive, but shouldst thou behold them in the grave, surely thou wouldst move away from them.",
        "44:19": "And she said unto him, How beautiful and pleasing are all thy words; take now, I pray thee, the harp which is in the house, and play with thy hands and let us hear thy words.",
        "44:20": "And he said unto her, How beautiful and pleasing are my words when I speak the praise of my God and his glory; and she said unto him, How very beautiful is the hair of thy head, behold the golden comb which is in the house, take it I pray thee, and curl the hair of thy head.",
        "44:21": "And he said unto her, How long wilt thou speak these words? cease to utter these words to me, and rise and attend to thy domestic affairs.",
        "44:22": "And she said unto him, There is no one in my house, and there is nothing to attend to but to thy words and to thy wish; yet notwithstanding all this, she could not bring Joseph unto her, neither did he place his eye upon her, but directed his eyes below to the ground.",
        "44:23": "And Zelicah desired Joseph in her heart, that he should lie with her, and at the time that Joseph was sitting in the house doing his work, Zelicah came and sat before him, and she enticed him daily with her discourse to lie with her, or ever to look at her, but Joseph would not hearken to her.",
        "44:24": "And she said unto him, If thou wilt not do according to my words, I will chastise thee with the punishment of death, and put an iron yoke upon thee.",
        "44:25": "And Joseph said unto her, Surely God who created man looseth the fetters of prisoners, and it is he who will deliver me from thy prison and from thy judgment.",
        "44:26": "And when she could not prevail over him, to persuade him, and her soul being still fixed upon him, her desire threw her into a grievous sickness.",
        "44:27": "And all the women of Egypt came to visit her, and they said unto her, Why art thou in this declining state? thou that lackest nothing; surely thy husband is a great and esteemed prince in the sight of the king, shouldst thou lack anything of what thy heart desireth?",
        "44:28": "And Zelicah answered them, saying, This day it shall be made known to you, whence this disorder springs in which you see me, and she commanded her maid servants to prepare food for all the women, and she made a banquet for them, and all the women ate in the house of Zelicah.",
        "44:29": "And she gave them knives to peel the citrons to eat them, and she commanded that they should dress Joseph in costly garments, and that he should appear before them, and Joseph came before their eyes and all the women looked on Joseph, and could not take their eyes from off him, and they all cut their hands with the knives that they had in their hands, and all the citrons that were in their hands were filled with blood.",
        "44:30": "And they knew not what they had done but they continued to look at the beauty of Joseph, and did not turn their eyelids from him.",
        "44:31": "And Zelicah saw what they had done, and she said unto them, What is this work that you have done? behold I gave you citrons to eat and you have all cut your hands.",
        "44:32": "And all the women saw their hands, and behold they were full of blood, and their blood flowed down upon their garments, and they said unto her, this slave in your house has overcome us, and we could not turn our eyelids from him on account of his beauty.",
        "44:33": "And she said unto them, Surely this happened to you in the moment that you looked at him, and you could not contain yourselves from him; how then can I refrain when he is constantly in my house, and I see him day after day going in and out of my house? how then can I keep from declining or even from perishing on account of this?",
        "44:34": "And they said unto her, the words are true, for who can see this beautiful form in the house and refrain from him, and is he not thy slave and attendant in thy house, and why dost thou not tell him that which is in thy heart, and sufferest thy soul to perish through this matter?",
        "44:35": "And she said unto them, I am daily endeavoring to persuade him, and he will not consent to my wishes, and I promised him everything that is good, and yet I could meet with no return from him; I am therefore in a declining state as you see.",
        "44:36": "And Zelicah became very ill on account of her desire toward Joseph, and she was desperately lovesick on account of him, and all the people of the house of Zelicah and her husband knew nothing of this matter, that Zelicah was ill on account of her love to Joseph.",
        "44:37": "And all the people of her house asked her, saying, Why art thou ill and declining, and lackest nothing? and she said unto them, I know not this thing which is daily increasing upon me.",
        "44:38": "And all the women and her friends came daily to see her, and they spoke with her, and she said unto them, This can only be through the love of Joseph; and they said unto her, Entice him and seize him secretly, perhaps he may hearken to thee, and put off this death from thee.",
        "44:39": "And Zelicah became worse from her love to Joseph, and she continued to decline, till she had scarce strength to stand.",
        "44:40": "And on a certain day Joseph was doing his master's work in the house, and Zelicah came secretly and fell suddenly upon him, and Joseph rose up against her, and he was more powerful than she, and he brought her down to the ground.",
        "44:41": "And Zelicah wept on account of the desire of her heart toward him, and she supplicated him with weeping, and her tears flowed down her cheeks, and she spoke unto him in a voice of supplication and in bitterness of soul, saying,",
        "44:42": "Hast thou ever heard, seen or known of so beautiful a woman as I am, or better than myself, who speak daily unto thee, fall into a decline through love for thee, confer all this honor upon thee, and still thou wilt not hearken to my voice?",
        "44:43": "And if it be through fear of thy master lest he punish thee, as the king liveth no harm shall come to thee from thy master through this thing; now, therefore pray listen to me, and consent for the sake of the honor which I have conferred upon thee, and put off this death from me, and why should I die for thy sake? and she ceased to speak.",
        "44:44": "And Joseph answered her, saying, Refrain from me, and leave this matter to my master; behold my master knoweth not what there is with me in the house, for all that belongeth to him he has delivered into my hand, and how shall I do these things in my master's house?",
        "44:45": "For he hath also greatly honored me in his house, and he hath also made me overseer over his house, and he hath exalted me, and there is no one greater in this house than I am, and my master hath refrained nothing from me, excepting thee who art his wife, how then canst thou speak these words unto me, and how can I do this great evil and sin to God and to thy husband?",
        "44:46": "Now therefore refrain from me, and speak no more such words as these, for I will not hearken to thy words. But Zelicah would not hearken to Joseph when he spoke these words unto her, but she daily enticed him to listen to her.",
        "44:47": "And it was after this that the brook of Egypt was filled above all its sides, and all the inhabitants of Egypt went forth, and also the king and princes went forth with timbrels and dances, for it was a great rejoicing in Egypt, and a holiday at the time of the inundation of the sea Sihor, and they went there to rejoice all the day.",
        "44:48": "And when the Egyptians went out to the river to rejoice, as was their custom, all the people of the house of Potiphar went with them, but Zelicah would not go with them, for she said, I am indisposed, and she remained alone in the house, and no other person was with her in the house.",
        "44:49": "And she rose up and ascended to her temple in the house, and dressed herself in princely garments, and she placed upon her head precious stones of onyx stones, inlaid with silver and gold, and she beautified her face and skin with all sorts of women's purifying liquids, and she perfumed the temple and the house with cassia and frankincense, and she spread myrrh and aloes, and she afterward sat in the entrance of the temple, in the passage of the house, through which Joseph passed to do his work, and behold Joseph came from the field, and entered the house to do his master's work.",
        "44:50": "And he came to the place through which he had to pass, and he saw all the work of Zelicah, and he turned back.",
        "44:51": "And Zelicah saw Joseph turning back from her, and she called out to him, saying What aileth thee Joseph? come to thy work, and behold I will make room for thee until thou shalt have passed to thy seat.",
        "44:52": "And Joseph returned and came to the house, and passed from thence to the place of his seat, and he sat down to do his master's work as usual and behold Zelicah came to him and stood before him in princely garments, and the scent from her clothes was spread to a distance.",
        "44:53": "And she hastened and caught hold of Joseph and his garments, and she said unto him, As the king liveth if thou wilt not perform my request thou shalt die this day, and she hastened and stretched forth her other hand and drew a sword from beneath her garments, and she placed it upon Joseph's neck, and she said, Rise and perform my request, and if not thou diest this day.",
        "44:54": "And Joseph was afraid of her at her doing this thing, and he rose up to flee from her, and she seized the front of his garments, and in the terror of his flight the garment which Zelicah seized was torn, and Joseph left the garment in the hand of Zelicah, and he fled and got out, for he was in fear.",
        "44:55": "And when Zelicah saw that Joseph's garment was torn, and that he had left it in her hand, and had fled, she was afraid of her life, lest the report should spread concerning her, and she rose up and acted with cunning, and put off the garments in which she was dressed, and she put on her other garments.",
        "44:56": "And she took Joseph's garment, and she laid it beside her, and she went and seated herself in the place where she had sat in her illness, before the people of her house had gone out to the river, and she called a young lad who was then in the house, and she ordered him to call the people of the house to her.",
        "44:57": "And when she saw them she said unto them with a loud voice and lamentation, See what a Hebrew your master has brought to me in the house, for he came this day to lie with me.",
        "44:58": "For when you had gone out he came to the house, and seeing that there was no person in the house, he came unto me, and caught hold of me, with intent to lie with me.",
        "44:59": "And I seized his garments and tore them and called out against him with a loud voice, and when I had lifted up my voice he was afraid of his life and left his garment before me, and fled.",
        "44:60": "And the people of her house spoke nothing, but their wrath was very much kindled against Joseph, and they went to his master and told him the words of his wile.",
        "44:61": "And Potiphar came home enraged, and his wife cried out to him, saying, What is this thing that thou hast done unto me in bringing a He. brew servant into my house, for he came unto me this day to sport with me; thus did he do unto me this day.",
        "44:62": "And Potiphar heard the words of his wife, and he ordered Joseph to be punished with severe stripes, and they did so to him.",
        "44:63": "And whilst they were smiting him, Joseph called out with a loud voice, and he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and he said, O Lord God, thou knowest that I am innocent of all these things, and why shall I die this day through falsehood, by the hand of these uncircumcised wicked men, whom thou knowest?",
        "44:64": "And whilst Potiphar's men were beating Joseph, he continued to cry out and weep, and there was a child there eleven months old, and the Lord opened the mouth of the child, and he spake these words before Potiphar's men, who were smiting Joseph, saying,",
        "44:65": "What do you want of this man, and why do you do this evil unto him? my mother speaketh falsely and uttereth lies; thus was the transaction.",
        "44:66": "And the child told them accurately all that happened, and all the words of Zelicah to Joseph day after day did he declare unto them.",
        "44:67": "And all the men heard the words of the child and they wondered greatly at the child's words, and the child ceased to speak and became still.",
        "44:68": "And Potiphar was very much ashamed at the words of his son, and he commanded his men not to beat Joseph any more, and the men ceased beating Joseph.",
        "44:69": "And Potiphar took Joseph and ordered him to be brought to justice before the priests, who were judges belonging to the king, in order to judge him concerning this affair.",
        "44:70": "And Potiphar and Joseph came before the priests who were the king's judges, and he said unto them, Decide I pray you, what judgment is due to a servant, for thus has he done.",
        "44:71": "And the priests said unto Joseph, Why didst thou do this thing to thy master? and Joseph answered them, saying, Not so my lords, thus was the matter; and Potiphar said unto Joseph, Surely I entrusted in thy hands all that belonged to me, and I withheld nothing from thee but my wife, and how couldst thou do this evil?",
        "44:72": "And Joseph answered saying, Not so my lord, as the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, my lord, the word which thou didst hear from thy wife is untrue, for thus was the affair this day.",
        "44:73": "A year has elapsed to me since I have been in thy house; hast thou seen any iniquity in me, or any thing which might cause thee to demand my life?",
        "44:74": "And the priests said unto Potiphar, Send, we pray thee, and let them bring before us Joseph's torn garment, and let us see the tear in it, and if it shall be that the tear is in front of the garment, then his face must have been opposite to her and she must have caught hold of him, to come to her, and with deceit did thy wife do all that she has spoken.",
        "44:75": "And they brought Joseph's garment before the priests who were judges, and they saw and behold the tear was in front of Joseph, and all the judging priests knew that she had pressed him, and they said, The judgment of death is not due to this slave for he has done nothing, but his judgment is, that he be placed in the prison house on account of the report, which through him has gone forth against thy wife.",
        "44:76": "And Potiphar heard their words, and he placed him in the prison house, the place where the king's prisoners are confined, and Joseph was in the house of confinement twelve years.",
        "44:77": "And notwithstanding this, his master's wife did not turn from him, and she did not cease from speaking to him day after day to hearken to her, and at the end of three months Zelicah continued going to Joseph to the house of confinement day by day, and she enticed him to hearken to her, and Zelicah said unto Joseph, How long wilt thou remain in this house? but hearken now to my voice, and I will bring thee out of this house.",
        "44:78": "And Joseph answered her, saying, It is better for me to remain in this house than to hearken to thy words, to sin against God; and she said unto him, If thou wilt not perform my wish, I will pluck out thine eyes, add fetters to thy feet, and will deliver thee into the hands of them whom thou didst not know before.",
        "44:79": "And Joseph answered her and said, Behold the God of the whole earth is able to deliver me from all that thou canst do unto me, for he openeth the eyes of the blind, and looseth those that are bound, and preserveth all strangers who are unacquainted with the land.",
        "44:80": "And when Zelicah was unable to persuade Joseph to hearken to her, she left off going to entice him; and Joseph was still confined in the house of confinement. And Jacob the father of Joseph, and all his brethren who were in the land of Canaan still mourned and wept in those days on account of Joseph, for Jacob refused to be comforted for his son Joseph, and Jacob cried aloud, and wept and mourned all those days.",
        "45:1": "And it was at that time in that year, which is the year of Joseph's going down to Egypt after his brothers had sold him, that Reuben the son of Jacob went to Timnah and took unto him for a wife Eliuram, the daughter of Avi the Canaanite, and he came to her.",

        "48:9": "The seven good kine which thou didst see denote seven daughters that will be born unto thee in the latter days, and the seven kine which thou sawest come up after them, and swallowed them up, are for a sign that the daughters which will be born unto thee will all die in the life-time of the king.",
        "48:10": "And that which thou didst see in the second dream of seven full good ears of corn coming up upon one stalk, this is their interpretation, that thou wilt build unto thyself in the latter days seven cities throughout the land of Egypt; and that which thou sawest of the seven blasted ears of corn springing up after them and swallowing them up whilst thou didst behold them with thine eyes, is for a sign that the cities which thou wilt build will all be destroyed in the latter days, in the life-time of the king.",
        "48:11": "And when they spoke these words the king did not incline his ear to their words, neither did he fix his heart upon them, for the king knew in his wisdom that they did not give a proper interpretation of the dreams; and when they had finished speaking before the king, the king answered them, saying, What is this thing that you have spoken unto me? surely you have uttered falsehood and spoken lies; therefore now give the proper interpretation of my dreams, that you may not die.",
        "48:12": "And the king commanded after this, and he sent and called again for other wise men, and they came and stood before the king, and the king related his dreams to them, and they all answered him according to the first interpretation, and the king's anger was kindled and he was very wroth, and the king said unto them, Surely you speak lies and utter falsehood in what you have said.",
        "48:13": "And the king commanded that a proclamation should be issued throughout the land of Egypt, saying, It is resolved by the king and his great men, that any wise man who knoweth and understandeth the interpretation of dreams, and will not come this day before the king, shall die.",
        "48:14": "And the man that will declare unto the king the proper interpretation of his dreams, there shall be given unto him all that he will require from the king. And all the wise men of the land of Egypt came before the king, together with all the magicians and sorcerers that were in Egypt and in Goshen, in Rameses, in Tachpanches, in Zoar, and in all the places on the borders of Egypt, and they all stood before the king.",
        "48:15": "And all the nobles and the princes, and the attendants belonging to the king, came together from all the cities of Egypt, and they all sat before the king, and the king related his dreams before the wise men, and the princes, and all that sat before the king were astonished at the vision.",
        "48:16": "And all the wise men who were before the king were greatly divided in their interpretation of his dreams; some of them interpreted them to the king, saying, The seven good kine are seven kings, who from the king's issue will be raised over Egypt.",
        "48:17": "And the seven bad kine are seven princes, who will stand up against them in the latter days and destroy them; and the seven ears of corn are the seven great princes belonging to Egypt, who will fall in the hands of the seven less powerful princes of their enemies, in the wars of our lord the king.",
        "48:18": "And some of them interpreted to the king in this manner, saying, The seven good kine are the strong cities of Egypt, and the seven bad kine are the seven nations of the land of Canaan, who will come against the seven cities of Egypt in the latter days and destroy them.",
        "48:19": "And that which thou sawest in the second dream, of seven good and bad ears of corn, is a sign that the government of Egypt will again return to thy seed as at first.",
        "48:20": "And in his reign the people of the cities of Egypt will turn against the seven cities of Canaan who are stronger than they are, and will destroy them, and the government of Egypt will return to thy seed.",
        "48:21": "And some of them said unto the king, This is the interpretation of thy dreams; the seven good kine are seven queens, whom thou wilt take for wives in the latter days, and the seven bad kine denote that those women will all die in the lifetime of the king.",
        "48:22": "And the seven good and bad ears of corn which thou didst see in the second dream are fourteen children, and it will be in the latter days that they will stand up and fight amongst themselves, and seven of them will smite the seven that are more powerful.",
        "48:23": "And some of them said these words unto the king, saying, The seven good kine denote that seven children will be born to thee, and they will slay seven of thy children's children in the latter days; and the seven good ears of corn which thou didst see in the second dream, are those princes against whom seven other less powerful princes will fight and destroy them in the latter days, and avenge thy children's cause, and the government will again return to thy seed.",
        "48:24": "And the king heard all the words of the wise men of Egypt and their interpretation of his dreams, and none of them pleased the king.",
        "48:25": "And the king knew in his wisdom that they did not altogether speak correctly in all these words, for this was from the Lord to frustrate the words of the wise men of Egypt, in order that Joseph might go forth from the house of confinement, and in order that he should become great in Egypt.",
        "48:26": "And the king saw that none amongst all the wise men and magicians of Egypt spoke correctly to him, and the king's wrath was kindled, and his anger burned within him.",
        "48:27": "And the king commanded that all the wise men and magicians should go out from before him, and they all went out from before the king with shame and disgrace.",
        "48:28": "And the king commanded that a proclamation be sent throughout Egypt to slay all the magicians that were in Egypt, and not one of them should be suffered to live.",
        "48:29": "And the captains of the guards belonging to the king rose up, and each man drew his sword, and they began to smite the magicians of Egypt, and the wise men.",
        "48:30": "And after this Merod, chief butler to the king, came and bowed down before the king and sat before him.",
        "48:31": "And the butler said unto the king, May the king live forever, and his government be exalted in the land.",
        "48:32": "Thou wast angry with thy servant in those days, now two years past, and didst place me in the ward, and I was for some time in the ward, I and the chief of the bakers.",
        "48:33": "And there was with us a Hebrew servant belonging to the captain of the guard, his name was Joseph, for his master had been angry with him and placed him in the house of confinement, and he attended us there.",
        "48:34": "And in some time after when we were in the ward, we dreamed dreams in one night, I and the chief of the bakers; we dreamed, each man according to the interpretation of his dream.",
        "48:35": "And we came in the morning and told them to that servant, and he interpreted to us our dreams, to each man according to his dream, did he correctly interpret.",
        "48:36": "And it came to pass as he interpreted to us, so was the event; there fell not to the ground any of his words.",
        "48:37": "And now therefore my lord and king do not slay the people of Egypt for naught; behold that slave is still confined in the house by the captain of the guard his master, in the house of confinement.",
        "48:38": "If it pleaseth the king let him send for him that he may come before thee and he will make known to thee, the correct interpretation of the dream which thou didst dream.",
        "48:39": "And the king heard the words of the chief butler, and the king ordered that the wise men of Egypt should not be slain.",
        "48:40": "And the king ordered his servants to bring Joseph before him, and the king said unto them, Go to him and do not terrify him lest he be confused and will not know to speak properly.",
        "48:41": "And the servants of the king went to Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon, and the king's servants shaved him, and he changed his prison garment and he came before the king.",
        "48:42": "And the king was sitting upon his royal throne in a princely dress girt around with a golden ephod, and the fine gold which was upon it sparkled, and the carbuncle and the ruby and the emerald, together with all the precious stones that were upon the king's head, dazzled the eye, and Joseph wondered greatly at the king.",
        "48:43": "And the throne upon which the king sat was covered with gold and silver, and with onyx stones, and it had seventy steps.",
        "48:44": "And it was their custom throughout the land of Egypt, that every man who came to speak to the king, if he was a prince or one that was estimable in the sight of the king, he ascended to the king's throne as far as the thirty-first step, and the king would descend to the thirty-sixth step, and speak with him.",
        "48:45": "If he was one of the common people, he ascended to the third step, and the king would descend to the fourth and speak to him, and their custom was, moreover, that any man who understood to speak in all the seventy languages, he ascended the seventy steps, and went up and spoke till he reached the king.",
        "48:46": "And any man who could not complete the seventy, he ascended as many steps as the languages which he knew to speak in.",
        "48:47": "And it was customary in those days in Egypt that no one should reign over them, but who understood to speak in the seventy languages.",
        "48:48": "And when Joseph came before the king he bowed down to the ground before the king, and he ascended to the third step, and the king sat upon the fourth step and spoke with Joseph.",
        "48:49": "And the king said unto Joseph, I dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter to interpret it properly, and I commanded this day that all the magicians of Egypt and the wise men thereof, should come before me, and I related my dreams to them, and no one has properly interpreted them to me.",
        "48:50": "And after this I this day heard concerning thee, that thou art a wise man, and canst correctly interpret every dream that thou hearest.",
        "48:51": "And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, Let Pharaoh relate his dreams that he dreamed; surely the interpretations belong to God; and Pharaoh related his dreams to Joseph, the dream of the kine, and the dream of the ears of corn, and the king left off speaking.",
        "48:52": "And Joseph was then clothed with the spirit of God before the king, and he knew all the things that would befall the king from that day forward, and he knew the proper interpretation of the king's dream, and he spoke before the king.",
        "48:53": "And Joseph found favor in the sight of the king, and the king inclined his ears and his heart, and he heard all the words of Joseph. And Joseph said unto the king, Do not imagine that they are two dreams, for it is only one dream, for that which God has chosen to do throughout the land he has shown to the king in his dream, and this is the proper interpretation of thy dream:",
        "48:54": "The seven good kine and ears of corn are seven years, and the seven bad kine and ears of corn are also seven years; it is one dream.",
        "48:55": "Behold the seven years that are coming there will be a great plenty throughout the land, and after that the seven years of famine will follow them, a very grievous famine; and all the plenty will be forgotten from the land, and the famine will consume the inhabitants of the land.",
        "48:56": "The king dreamed one dream, and the dream was therefore repeated unto Pharaoh because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.",
        "48:57": "Now therefore I will give thee counsel and deliver thy soul and the souls of the inhabitants of the land from the evil of the famine, that thou seek throughout thy kingdom for a man very discreet and wise, who knoweth all the affairs of government, and appoint him to superintend over the land of Egypt.",
        "48:58": "And let the man whom thou placest over Egypt appoint officers under him, that they gather in all the food of the good years that are coming, and let them lay up corn and deposit it in thy appointed stores.",
        "48:59": "And let them keep that food for the seven years of famine, that it may be found for thee and thy people and thy whole land, and that thou and thy land be not cut off by the famine.",
        "48:60": "Let all the inhabitants of the land be also ordered that they gather in, every man the produce of his field, of all sorts of food, during the seven good years, and that they place it in their stores, that it may be found for them in the days of the famine and that they may live upon it.",
        "48:61": "This is the proper interpretation of thy dream, and this is the counsel given to save thy soul and the souls of all thy subjects.",
        "48:62": "And the king answered and said unto Joseph, Who sayeth and who knoweth that thy words are correct? And he said unto the king, This shall be a sign for thee respecting all my words, that they are true and that my advice is good for thee.",
        "48:63": "Behold thy wife sitteth this day upon the stool of delivery, and she will bear thee a son and thou wilt rejoice with him; when thy child shall have gone forth from his mother's womb, thy first born son that has been born these two years back shall die, and thou wilt be comforted in the child that will be born unto thee this day.",
        "48:64": "And Joseph finished speaking these words to the king, and he bowed down to the king and he went out, and when Joseph had gone out from the king's presence, those signs which Joseph had spoken unto the king came to pass on that day.",
        "48:65": "And the queen bare a son on that day and the king heard the glad tidings about his son, and he rejoiced, and when the reporter had gone forth from the king's presence, the king's servants found the first born son of the king fallen dead upon the ground.",
        "48:66": "And there was great lamentation and noise in the king's house, and the king heard it, and he said, What is the noise and lamentation that I have heard in the house? and they told the king that his first born son had died; then the king knew that all Joseph's words that he had spoken were correct, and the king was consoled for his son by the child that was born to him on that day as Joseph had spoken.",
        "49:1": "After these things the king sent and assembled all his officers and servants, and all the princes and nobles belonging to the king, and they all came before the king.",
        "49:2": "And the king said unto them, Behold you have seen and heard all the words of this Hebrew man, and all the signs which he declared would come to pass, and not any of his words have fallen to the ground.",
        "49:3": "You know that he has given a proper interpretation of the dream, and it will surely come to pass, now therefore take counsel, and know what you will do and how the land will be delivered from the famine.",
        "49:4": "Seek now and see whether the like can be found, in whose heart there is wisdom and knowledge, and I will appoint him over the land.",
        "49:5": "For you have heard what the Hebrew man has advised concerning this to save the land therewith from the famine, and I know that the land will not be delivered from the famine but with the advice of the Hebrew man, him that advised me.",
        "49:6": "And they all answered the king and said, The counsel which the Hebrew has given concerning this is good; now therefore, our lord and king, behold the whole land is in thy hand, do that which seemeth good in thy sight.",
        "49:7": "Him whom thou chooses, and whom thou in thy wisdom knowest to be wise and capable of delivering the land with his wisdom, him shall the king appoint to be under him over the land.",
        "49:8": "And the king said to all the officers: I have thought that since God has made known to the Hebrew man all that he has spoken, there is none so discreet and wise in the whole land as he is; if it seem good in your sight I will place him over the land, for he will save the land with his wisdom.",
        "49:9": "And all the officers answered the king and said, But surely it is written in the laws of Egypt, and it should not be violated, that no man shall reign over Egypt, nor be the second to the king, but one who has knowledge in all the languages of the sons of men.",
        "49:10": "Now therefore our lord and king, behold this Hebrew man can only speak the Hebrew language, and how then can he be over us the second under government, a man who not even knoweth our language?",
        "49:11": "Now we pray thee send for him, and let him come before thee, and prove him in all things, and do as thou see fit.",
        "49:12": "And the king said, It shall be done tomorrow, and the thing that you have spoken is good; and all the officers came on that day before the king.",
        "49:13": "And on that night the Lord sent one of his ministering angels, and he came into the land of Egypt unto Joseph, and the angel of the Lord stood over Joseph, and behold Joseph was lying in the bed at night in his master's house in the dungeon, for his master had put him back into the dungeon on account of his wife.",
        "49:14": "And the angel roused him from his sleep, and Joseph rose up and stood upon his legs, and behold the angel of the Lord was standing opposite to him; and the angel of the Lord spoke with Joseph, and he taught him all the languages of man in that night, and he called his name Jehoseph.",
        "49:15": "And the angel of the Lord went from him, and Joseph returned and lay upon his bed, and Joseph was astonished at the vision which he saw.",
        "49:16": "And it came to pass in the morning that the king sent for all his officers and servants, and they all came and sat before the king, and the king ordered Joseph to be brought, and the king's servants went and brought Joseph before Pharaoh.",
        "49:17": "And the king came forth and ascended the steps of the throne, and Joseph spoke unto the king in all languages, and Joseph went up to him and spoke unto the king until he arrived before the king in the seventieth step, and he sat before the king.",
        "49:18": "And the king greatly rejoiced on account of Joseph, and all the king's officers rejoiced greatly with the king when they heard all the words of Joseph.",
        "49:19": "And the thing seemed good in the sight of the king and the officers, to appoint Joseph to be second to the king over the whole land of Egypt, and the king spoke to Joseph, saying,",
        "49:20": "Now thou didst give me counsel to appoint a wise man over the land of Egypt, in order with his wisdom to save the land from the famine; now therefore, since God has made all this known to thee, and all the words which thou hast spoken, there is not throughout the land a discreet and wise man like unto thee.",
        "49:21": "And thy name no more shall be called Joseph, but Zaphnath Paaneah shall be thy name; thou shalt be second to me, and according to thy word shall be all the affairs of my government, and at thy word shall my people go out and come in.",
        "49:22": "Also from under thy hand shall my servants and officers receive their salary which is given to them monthly, and to thee shall all the people of the land bow down; only in my throne will I be greater than thou.",
        "49:23": "And the king took off his ring from his hand and put it upon the hand of Joseph, and the king dressed Joseph in a princely garment, and he put a golden crown upon his head, and he put a golden chain upon his neck.",
        "49:24": "And the king commanded his servants, and they made him ride in the second chariot belonging to the king, that went opposite to the king's chariot, and he caused him to ride upon a great and strong horse from the king's horses, and to be conducted through the streets of the land of Egypt.",
        "49:25": "And the king commanded that all those that played upon timbrels, harps and other musical instruments should go forth with Joseph; one thousand timbrels, one thousand mecholoth, and one thousand nebalim went after him.",
        "49:26": "And five thousand men, with drawn swords glittering in their hands, and they went marching and playing before Joseph, and twenty thousand of the great men of the king girt with girdles of skin covered with gold, marched at the right hand of Joseph, and twenty thousand at his left, and all the women and damsels went upon the roofs or stood in the streets playing and rejoicing at Joseph, and gazed at the appearance of Joseph and at his beauty.",
        "49:27": "And the king's people went before him and behind him, perfuming the road with frankincense and with cassia, and with all sorts of fine perfume, and scattered myrrh and aloes along the road, and twenty men proclaimed these words before him throughout the land in a loud voice:",
        "49:28": "Do you see this man whom the king has chosen to be his second? all the affairs of government shall be regulated by him, and he that transgresses his orders, or that does not bow down before him to the ground, shall die, for he rebels against the king and his second.",
        "49:29": "And when the heralds had ceased proclaiming, all the people of Egypt bowed down to the ground before Joseph and said, May the king live, also may his second live; and all the inhabitants of Egypt bowed down along the road, and when the heralds approached them, they bowed down, and they rejoiced with all sorts of timbrels, mechol and nebal before Joseph.",
        "49:30": "And Joseph upon his horse lifted up his eyes to heaven, and called out and said, He raiseth the poor man from the dust, He lifteth up the needy from the dunghill. O Lord of Hosts, happy is the man who trusteth in thee.",
        "49:31": "And Joseph passed throughout the land of Egypt with Pharaoh's servants and officers, and they showed him the whole land of Egypt and all the king's treasures.",
        "49:32": "And Joseph returned and came on that day before Pharaoh, and the king gave unto Joseph a possession in the land of Egypt, a possession of fields and vineyards, and the king gave unto Joseph three thousand talents of silver and one thousand talents of gold, and onyx stones and bdellium and many gifts.",
        "49:33": "And on the next day the king commanded all the people of Egypt to bring unto Joseph offerings and gifts, and that he that violated the command of the king should die; and they made a high place in the street of the city, and they spread out garments there, and whoever brought anything to Joseph put it into the high place.",
        "49:34": "And all the people of Egypt cast something into the high place, one man a golden ear-ring, and the other rings and ear-rings, and different vessels of gold and silver work, and onyx stones and bdellium did he cast upon the high place; every one gave something of what he possessed.",
        "49:35": "And Joseph took all these and placed them in his treasuries, and all the officers and nobles belonging to the king exalted Joseph, and they gave him many gifts, seeing that the king had chosen him to be his second.",
        "49:36": "And the king sent to Potiphera, the son of Ahiram priest of On, and he took his young daughter Osnath and gave her unto Joseph for a wife.",
        "49:37": "And the damsel was very comely, a virgin, one whom man had not known, and Joseph took her for a wife; and the king said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and beside thee none shall dare to lift up his hand or his foot to regulate my people throughout the land of Egypt.",
        "49:38": "And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh, and Joseph went out from before the king, and he became the king's second in Egypt.",
        "49:39": "And the king gave Joseph a hundred servants to attend him in his house, and Joseph also sent and purchased many servants and they remained in the house of Joseph.",
        "49:40": "Joseph then built for himself a very magnificent house like unto the houses of kings, before the court of the king's palace, and he made in the house a large temple, very elegant in appearance and convenient for his residence; three years was Joseph in erecting his house.",
        "49:41": "And Joseph made unto himself a very elegant throne of abundance of gold and silver, and he covered it with onyx stones and bdellium, and he made upon it the likeness of the whole land of Egypt, and the likeness of the river of Egypt that watereth the whole land of Egypt; and Joseph sat securely upon his throne in his house and the Lord increased Joseph's wisdom.",
        "49:42": "And all the inhabitants of Egypt and Pharaoh's servants and his princes loved Joseph exceedingly, for this thing was from the Lord to Joseph.",
        "49:43": "And Joseph had an army that made war, going out in hosts and troops to the number of forty thousand six hundred men, capable of bearing arms to assist the king and Joseph against the enemy, besides the king's officers and his servants and inhabitants of Egypt without number.",
        "49:44": "And Joseph gave unto his mighty men, and to all his host, shields and javelins, and caps and coats of mail and stones for slinging.",
        "50:1": "At that time the children of Tarshish came against the sons of Ishmael, and made war with them, and the children of Tarshish spoiled the Ishmaelites for a long time.",
        "50:2": "And the children of Ishmael were small in number in those days, and they could not prevail over the children of Tarshish, and they were sorely oppressed.",
        "50:3": "And the old men of the Ishmaelites sent a record to the king of Egypt, saying, Send I pray thee unto thy servants officers and hosts to help us to fight against the children of Tarshish, for we have been consuming away for a long time.",
        "50:4": "And Pharaoh sent Joseph with the mighty men and host which were with him, and also his mighty men from the king's house.",
        "50:5": "And they went to the land of Havilah to the children of Ishmael, to assist them against the children of Tarshish, and the children of Ishmael fought with the children of Tarshish, and Joseph smote the Tarshishites and he subdued all their land, and the children of Ishmael dwell therein unto this day.",
        "50:6": "And when the land of Tarshish was subdued, all the Tarshishites ran away, and came on the border of their brethren the children of Javan, and Joseph with all his mighty men and host returned to Egypt, not one man of them missing.",
        "50:7": "And at the revolution of the year, in the second year of Joseph's reigning over Egypt, the Lord gave great plenty throughout the land for seven years as Joseph had spoken, for the Lord blessed all the produce of the earth in those days for seven years, and they ate and were greatly satisfied.",
        "50:8": "And Joseph at that time had officers under him, and they collected all the food of the good years, and heaped corn year by year, and they placed it in the treasuries of Joseph.",
        "50:9": "And at any time when they gathered the food Joseph commanded that they should bring the corn in the ears, and also bring with it some of the soil of the field, that it should not spoil.",
        "50:10": "And Joseph did according to this year by year, and he heaped up corn like the sand of the sea for abundance, for his stores were immense and could not be numbered for abundance.",
        "50:11": "And also all the inhabitants of Egypt gathered all sorts of food in their stores in great abundance during the seven good years, but they did not do unto it as Joseph did.",
        "50:12": "And all the food which Joseph and the Egyptians had gathered during the seven years of plenty, was secured for the land in stores for the seven years of famine, for the support of the whole land.",
        "50:13": "And the inhabitants of Egypt filled each man his store and his concealed place with corn, to be for support during the famine.",
        "50:14": "And Joseph placed all the food that he had gathered in all the cities of Egypt, and he closed all the stores and placed sentinels over them.",
        "50:15": "And Joseph's wife Osnath the daughter of Potiphera bare him two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, and Joseph was thirty-four years old when he begat them.",
        "50:16": "And the lads grew up and they went in his ways and in his instructions, they did not deviate from the way which their father taught them, either to the right or left.",
        "50:17": "And the Lord was with the lads, and they grew up and had understanding and skill in all wisdom and in all the affairs of government, and all the king's officers and his great men of the inhabitants of Egypt exalted the lads, and they were brought up amongst the king's children.",
        "50:18": "And the seven years of plenty that were throughout the land were at an end, and the seven years of famine came after them as Joseph had spoken, and the famine was throughout the land.",
        "50:19": "And all the people of Egypt saw that the famine had commenced in the land of Egypt, and all the people of Egypt opened their stores of corn for the famine prevailed over them.",
        "50:20": "And they found all the food that was in their stores, full of vermin and not fit to eat, and the famine prevailed throughout the land, and all the inhabitants of Egypt came and cried before Pharaoh, for the famine was heavy upon them.",
        "50:21": "And they said unto Pharaoh, Give food unto thy servants, and wherefore shall we die through hunger before thy eyes, even we and our little ones?",
        "50:22": "And Pharaoh answered them, saying, And wherefore do you cry unto me? did not Joseph command that the corn should be laid up during the seven years of plenty for the years of famine? and wherefore did you not hearken to his voice?",
        "50:23": "And the people of Egypt answered the king, saying, As thy soul liveth, our lord, thy servants have done all that Joseph ordered, for thy servants also gathered in all the produce of their fields during the seven years of plenty and laid it in the stores unto this day.",
        "50:24": "And when the famine prevailed over thy servants we opened our stores, and behold all our produce was filled with vermin and was not fit for food.",
        "50:25": "And when the king heard all that had befallen the inhabitants of Egypt, the king was greatly afraid on account of the famine, and he was much terrified; and the king answered the people of Egypt, saying, Since all this has happened unto you, go unto Joseph, do whatever he shall say unto you, transgress not his commands.",
        "50:26": "And all the people of Egypt went forth and came unto Joseph, and said unto him, Give unto us food, and wherefore shall we die before thee through hunger? for we gathered in our produce during the seven years as thou didst command, and we put it in store, and thus has it befallen us.",
        "50:27": "And when Joseph heard all the words of the people of Egypt and what had befallen them, Joseph opened all his stores of the produce and he sold it unto the people of Egypt.",
        "50:28": "And the famine prevailed throughout the land, and the famine was in all countries, but in the land of Egypt there was produce for sale.",
        "50:29": "And all the inhabitants of Egypt came unto Joseph to buy corn, for the famine prevailed over them, and all their corn was spoiled, and Joseph daily sold it to all the people of Egypt.",
        "50:30": "And all the inhabitants of the land of Canaan and the Philistines, and those beyond the Jordan, and the children of the east and all the cities of the lands far and nigh heard that there was corn in Egypt, and they all came to Egypt to buy corn, for the famine prevailed over them.",
        "50:31": "And Joseph opened the stores of corn and placed officers over them, and they daily stood and sold to all that came.",
        "50:32": "And Joseph knew that his brethren also would come to Egypt to buy corn, for the famine prevailed throughout the earth. And Joseph commanded all his people that they should cause it to be proclaimed throughout the land of Egypt, saying,",
        "50:33": "It is the pleasure of the king, of his second and of their great men, that any person who wishes to buy corn in Egypt shall not send his servants to Egypt to purchase, but his sons, and also any Egyptian or Canaanite, who shall come from any of the stores from buying corn in Egypt, and shall go and sell it throughout the land, he shall die, for no one shall buy but for the support of his household.",
        "50:34": "And any man leading two or three beasts shall die, for a man shall only lead his own beast.",
        "50:35": "And Joseph placed sentinels at the gates of Egypt, and commanded them, saying, Any person who may come to buy corn, suffer him not to enter until his name, and the name of his father, and the name of his father's father be written down, and whatever is written by day, send their names unto me in the evening that I may know their names.",
        "50:36": "And Joseph placed officers throughout the land of Egypt, and he commanded them to do all these things.",
        "50:37": "And Joseph did all these things, and made these statutes, in order that he might know when his brethren should come to Egypt to buy corn; and Joseph's people caused it daily to be proclaimed in Egypt according to these words and statutes which Joseph had commanded.",
        "50:38": "And all the inhabitants of the east and west country, and of all the earth, heard of the statutes and regulations which Joseph had enacted in Egypt, and the inhabitants of the extreme parts of the earth came and they bought corn in Egypt day after day, and then went away.",
        "50:39": "And all the officers of Egypt did as Joseph had commanded, and all that came to Egypt to buy corn, the gate keepers would write their names, and their fathers' names, and daily bring them in the evening before Joseph.",
        "51:1": "And Jacob afterward heard that there was corn in Egypt, and he called unto his sons to go to Egypt to buy corn, for upon them also did the famine prevail, and he called unto his sons, saying,",
        "51:2": "Behold I hear that there is corn in Egypt, and all the people of the earth go there to purchase, now therefore why will you show yourselves satisfied before the whole earth? go you also down to Egypt and buy us a little corn amongst those that come there, that we may not die.",
        "51:3": "And the sons of Jacob hearkened to the voice of their father, and they rose up to go down to Egypt in order to buy corn amongst the rest that came there.",
        "51:4": "And Jacob their father commanded them, saying, When you come into the city do not enter together in one gate, on account of the inhabitants of the land.",
        "51:5": "And the sons of Jacob went forth and they went to Egypt, and the sons of Jacob did all as their father had commanded them, and Jacob did not send Benjamin, for he said, Lest an accident might befall him on the road like his brother; and ten of Jacob's sons went forth.",
        "51:6": "And whilst the sons of Jacob were going on the road, they repented of what they had done to Joseph, and they spoke to each other, saying, We know that our brother Joseph went down to Egypt, and now we will seek him where we go, and if we find him we will take him from his master for a ransom, and if not, by force, and we will die for him.",
        "51:7": "And the sons of Jacob agreed to this thing and strengthened themselves on account of Joseph, to deliver him from the hand of his master, and the sons of Jacob went to Egypt; and when they came near to Egypt they separated from each other, and they came through ten gates of Egypt, and the gate keepers wrote their names on that day, and brought them to Joseph in the evening.",
        "51:8": "And Joseph read the names from the hand of the gate-keepers of the city, and he found that his brethren had entered at the ten gates of the city, and Joseph at that time commanded that it should be proclaimed throughout the land of Egypt, saying,",
        "51:9": "Go forth all ye store guards, close all the corn stores and let only one remain open, that those who come may purchase from it.",
        "51:10": "And all the officers of Joseph did so at that time, and they closed all the stores and left only one open.",
        "51:11": "And Joseph gave the written names of his brethren to him that was set over the open store, and he said unto him, Whosoever shall come to thee to buy corn, ask his name, and when men of these names shall come before thee, seize them and send them, and they did so.",
        "51:12": "And when the sons of Jacob came into the city, they joined together in the city to seek Joseph before they bought themselves corn.",
        "51:13": "And they went to the walls of the harlots, and they sought Joseph in the walls of the harlots for three days, for they thought that Joseph would come in the walls of the harlots, for Joseph was very comely and well favored, and the sons of Jacob sought Joseph for three days, and they could not find him.",
        "51:14": "And the man who was set over the open store sought for those names which Joseph had given him, and he did not find them.",
        "51:15": "And he sent to Joseph, saying, These three days have passed, and those men whose names thou didst give unto me have not come; and Joseph sent servants to seek the men in all Egypt, and to bring them before Joseph.",
        "51:16": "And Joseph's servants went and came into Egypt and could not find them, and went to Goshen and they were not there, and then went to the city of Rameses and could not find them.",
        "51:17": "And Joseph continued to send sixteen servants to seek his brothers, and they went and spread themselves in the four corners of the city, and four of the servants went into the house of the harlots, and they found the ten men there seeking their brother.",
        "51:18": "And those four men took them and brought them before him, and they bowed down to him to the ground, and Joseph was sitting upon his throne in his temple, clothed with princely garments, and upon his head was a large crown of gold, and all the mighty men were sitting around him.",
        "51:19": "And the sons of Jacob saw Joseph, and his figure and comeliness and dignity of countenance seemed wonderful in their eyes, and they again bowed down to him to the ground.",
        "51:20": "And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but they knew him not, for Joseph was very great in their eyes, therefore they knew him not.",
        "51:21": "And Joseph spoke to them, saying, From whence come ye? and they all answered and said, Thy servants have come from the land of Canaan to buy corn, for the famine prevails throughout the earth, and thy servants heard that there was corn in Egypt, so they have come amongst the other comers to buy corn for their support.",
        "51:22": "And Joseph answered them, saying, If you have come to purchase as you say, why do you come through ten gates of the city? it can only be that you have come to spy through the land.",
        "51:23": "And they all together answered Joseph, and said, Not so my lord, we are right, thy servants are not spies, but we have come to buy corn, for thy servants are all brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan, and our father commanded us, saying, When you come to the city do not enter together at one gate on account of the inhabitants of the land.",
        "51:24": "And Joseph again answered them and said, That is the thing which I spoke unto you, you have come to spy through the land, therefore you all came through ten gates of the city; you have come to see the nakedness of the land.",
        "51:25": "Surely every one that cometh to buy corn goeth his way, and you are already three days in the land, and what do you do in the walls of harlots in which you have been for these three days? surely spies do like unto these things.",
        "51:26": "And they said unto Joseph, Far be it from our lord to speak thus, for we are twelve brothers, the sons of our father Jacob, in the land of Canaan, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the Hebrew, and behold the youngest is with our father this day in the land of Canaan, and one is not, for he was lost from us, and we thought perhaps he might be in this land, so we are seeking him throughout the land, and have come even to the houses of harlots to seek him there.",
        "51:27": "And Joseph said unto them, And have you then sought him throughout the earth, that there only remained Egypt for you to seek him in? And what also should your brother do in the houses of harlots, although he were in Egypt? have you not said, That you are from the sons of Isaac, the son of Abraham, and what shall the sons of Jacob do then in the houses of harlots?",
        "51:28": "And they said unto him, Because we heard that Ishmaelites stole him from us, and it was told unto us that they sold him in Egypt, and thy servant, our brother, is very comely and well favored, so we thought he would surely be in the houses of harlots, therefore thy servants went there to seek him and give ransom for him.",
        "51:29": "And Joseph still answered them, saying, Surely you speak falsely and utter lies, to say of yourselves that you are the sons of Abraham; as Pharaoh liveth you are spies, therefore have you come to the houses of harlots that you should not be known.",
        "51:30": "And Joseph said unto them, And now if you find him, and his master requireth of you a great price, will you give it for him? and they said, It shall be given.",
        "51:31": "And he said unto them, And if his master will not consent to part with him for a great price, what will you do unto him on his account? and they answered him, saying, If he will not give him unto us we will slay him, and take our brother and go away.",
        "51:32": "And Joseph said unto them, That is the thing which I have spoken to you; you are spies, for you are come to slay the inhabitants of the land, for we heard that two of your brethren smote all the inhabitants of Shechem, in the land of Canaan, on account of your sister, and you now come to do the like in Egypt on account of your brother.",
        "51:33": "Only hereby shall I know that you are true men; if you will send home one from amongst you to fetch your youngest brother from your father, and to bring him here unto me, and by doing this thing I will know that you are right.",
        "51:34": "And Joseph called to seventy of his mighty men, and he said unto them, Take these men and bring them into the ward.",
        "51:35": "And the mighty men took the ten men, they laid hold of them and put them into the ward, and they were in the ward three days.",
        "51:36": "And on the third day Joseph had them brought out of the ward, and he said unto them, Do this for yourselves if you be true men, so that you may live, one of your brethren shall be confined in the ward whilst you go and take home the corn for your household to the land of Canaan, and fetch your youngest brother, and bring him here unto me, that I may know that you are true men when you do this thing.",
        "51:37": "And Joseph went out from them and came into the chamber, and wept a great weeping, for his pity was excited for them, and he washed his face, and returned to them again, and he took Simeon from them and ordered him to be bound, but Simeon was not willing to be done so, for he was a very powerful man and they could not bind him.",
        "51:38": "And Joseph called unto his mighty men and seventy valiant men came before him with drawn swords in their hands, and the sons of Jacob were terrified at them.",
        "51:39": "And Joseph said unto them, Seize this man and confine him in prison until his brethren come to him, and Joseph's valiant men hastened and they all laid hold of Simeon to bind him, and Simeon gave a loud and terrible shriek and the cry was heard at a distance.",
        "51:40": "And all the valiant men of Joseph were terrified at the sound of the shriek, that they fell upon their faces, and they were greatly afraid and fled.",
        "51:41": "And all the men that were with Joseph fled, for they were greatly afraid of their lives, and only Joseph and Manasseh his son remained there, and Manassah the son of Joseph saw the strength of Simeon, and he was exceedingly wroth.",
        "51:42": "And Manassah the son of Joseph rose up to Simeon, and Manassah smote Simeon a heavy blow with his fist against the back of his neck, and Simeon was stilled of his rage.",
        "51:43": "And Manassah laid hold of Simeon and he seized him violently and he bound him and brought him into the house of confinement, and all the sons of Jacob were astonished at the act of the youth.",
        "51:44": "And Simeon said unto his brethren, None of you must say that this is the smiting of an Egyptian, but it is the smiting of the house of my father.",
        "51:45": "And after this Joseph ordered him to be called who was set over the storehouse, to fill their sacks with corn as much as they could carry, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the road, and thus did he unto them.",
        "51:46": "And Joseph commanded them, saying, Take heed lest you transgress my orders to bring your brother as I have told you, and it shall be when you bring your brother hither unto me, then will I know that you are true men, and you shall traffic in the land, and I will restore unto you your brother, and you shall return in peace to your father.",
        "51:47": "And they all answered and said, According as our lord speaketh so will we do, and they bowed down to him to the ground.",
        "51:48": "And every man lifted his corn upon his ass, and they went out to go to the land of Canaan to their father; and they came to the inn and Levi spread his sack to give provender to his ass, when he saw and behold his money in full weight was still in his sack.",
        "51:49": "And the man was greatly afraid, and he said unto his brethren, My money is restored, and lo, it is even in my sack, and the men were greatly afraid, and they said, What is this that God hath done unto us?",
        "51:50": "And they all said, And where is the Lord's kindness with our fathers, with Abraham, Isaac, end Jacob, that the Lord has this day delivered us into the hands of the king of Egypt to contrive against us?",
        "51:51": "And Judah said unto them, Surely we are guilty sinners before the Lord our God in having sold our brother, our own flesh, and wherefore do you say, Where is the Lord's kindness with our fathers?",
        "51:52": "And Reuben said unto them, Said I not unto you, do not sin against the lad, and you would not listen to me? now God requireth him from us, and how dare you say, Where is the Lord's kindness with our fathers, whilst you have sinned unto the Lord?",
        "51:53": "And they tarried over night in that place, and they rose up early in the morning and laded their asses with their corn, and they led them and went on and came to their father's house in the land of Canaan.",
        "51:54": "And Jacob and his household went out to meet his sons, and Jacob saw and behold their brother Simeon was not with them, and Jacob said unto his sons, Where is your brother Simeon, whom I do not see? and his sons told him all that had befallen them in Egypt.",
        "52:1": "And they entered their house, and every man opened his sack and they saw and behold every man's bundle of money was there, at which they and their father were greatly terrified.",
        "52:2": "And Jacob said unto them, What is this that you have done to me? I sent your brother Joseph to inquire after your welfare and you said unto me. A wild beast did devour him.",
        "52:3": "And Simeon went with you to buy food and you say the king of Egypt hath confined him in prison, and you wish to take Benjamin to cause his death also, and bring down my grey hairs with sorrow to the grave on account of Benjamin and his brother Joseph.",
        "52:4": "Now therefore my son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead and he is left alone, and mischief may befall him by the way in which you go, as it befell his brother.",
        "52:5": "And Reuben said unto his father, Thou shalt slay my two sons if I do not bring thy son and place him before thee; and Jacob said unto his sons, Abide ye here and do not go down to Egypt, for my son shall not go down with you to Egypt, nor die like his brother.",
        "52:6": "And Judah said unto them, refrain ye from him until the corn is finished, and he will then say, Take down your brother, when he will find his own life and the life of his household in danger from the famine.",
        "52:7": "And in those days the famine was sore throughout the land, and all the people of the earth went and came to Egypt to buy food, for the famine prevailed greatly amongst them, and the sons of Jacob remained in Canaan a year and two months until their corn was finished.",
        "52:8": "And it came to pass after their corn was finished, the whole household of Jacob was pinched with hunger, and all the infants of the sons of Jacob came together and they approached Jacob, and they all surrounded him, and they said unto him, Give unto us bread, and wherefore shall we all perish through hunger in thy presence?",
        "52:9": "Jacob heard the words of his son's children, and he wept a great weeping, and his pity was roused for them, and Jacob called unto his sons and they all came and sat before him.",
        "52:10": "And Jacob said unto them, And have you not seen how your children have been weeping over me this day, saying, Give unto us bread, and there is none? now therefore return and buy for us a little food.",
        "52:11": "And Judah answered and said unto his father, If thou wilt send our brother with us we will go down and buy corn for thee, and if thou wilt not send him then we will not go down, for surely the king of Egypt particularly enjoined us, saying, You shall not see my face unless your brother be with you, for the king of Egypt is a strong and mighty king, and behold if we shall go to him without our brother we shall all be put to death.",
        "52:12": "Dost thou not know and hast thou not heard that this king is very powerful and wise, and there is not like unto him in all the earth? behold we have seen all the kings of the earth and we have not seen one like that king, the king of Egypt; surely amongst all the kings of the earth there is none greater than Abimelech king of the Philistines, yet the king of Egypt is greater and mightier than he, and Abimelech can only be compared to one of his officers.",
        "52:13": "Father, thou hast not seen his palace and his throne, and all his servants standing before him; thou hast not seen that king upon his throne in his pomp and royal appearance, dressed in his kingly robes with a large golden crown upon his head; thou hast not seen the honor and glory which God has given unto him, for there is not like unto him in all the earth.",
        "52:14": "Father, thou hast not seen the wisdom, the understanding and the knowledge which God has given in his heart, nor heard his sweet voice when he spake unto us.",
        "52:15": "We know not, father, who made him acquainted with our names and all that befell us, yet he asked also after thee, saying, Is your father still living, and is it well with him?",
        "52:16": "Thou hast not seen the affairs of the government of Egypt regulated by him, without inquiring of Pharaoh his lord; thou hast not seen the awe and fear which he impressed upon all the Egyptians.",
        "52:17": "And also when we went from him, we threatened to do unto Egypt like unto the rest of the cities of the Amorites, and we were exceedingly wroth against all his words which he spoke concerning us as spies, and now when we shall again come before him his terror will fall upon us all, and not one of us will be able to speak to him either a little or a great thing.",
        "52:18": "Now therefore father, send we pray thee the lad with us, and we will go down and buy thee food for our support, and not die through hunger. And Jacob said, Why have you dealt so ill with me to tell the king you had a brother? what is this thing that you have done unto me?",
        "52:19": "And Judah said unto Jacob his father, Give the lad into my care and we will rise up and go down to Egypt and buy corn, and then return, and it shall be when we return if the lad be not with us, then let me bear thy blame forever.",
        "52:20": "Hast thou seen all our infants weeping over thee through hunger and there is no power in thy hand to satisfy them? now let thy pity be roused for them and send our brother with us and we will go.",
        "52:21": "For how will the Lord's kindness to our ancestors be manifested to thee when thou sayest that the king of Egypt will take away thy son? as the Lord liveth I will not leave him until I bring him and place him before thee; but pray for us unto the Lord, that he may deal kindly with us, to cause us to be received favorably and kindly before the king of Egypt and his men, for had we not delayed surely now we had returned a second time with thy son.",
        "52:22": "And Jacob said unto his sons, I trust in the Lord God that he may deliver you and give you favor in the sight of the king of Egypt, and in the sight of all his men.",
        "52:23": "Now therefore rise up and go to the man, and take for him in your hands a present from what can be obtained in the land and bring it before him, and may the Almighty God give you mercy before him that he may send Benjamin and Simeon your brethren with you.",
        "52:24": "And all the men rose up, and they took their brother Benjamin, and they took in their hands a large present of the best of the land, and they also took a double portion of silver.",
        "52:25": "And Jacob strictly commanded his sons concerning Benjamin, Saying, Take heed of him in the way in which you are going, and do not separate yourselves from him in the road, neither in Egypt.",
        "52:26": "And Jacob rose up from his sons and spread forth his hands and he prayed unto the Lord on account of his sons, saying, O Lord God of heaven and earth, remember thy covenant with our father Abraham, remember it with my father Isaac and deal kindly with my sons and deliver them not into the hands of the king of Egypt; do it I pray thee O God for the sake of thy mercies and redeem all my children and rescue them from Egyptian power, and send them their two brothers.",
        "52:27": "And all the wives of the sons of Jacob and their children lifted up their eyes to heaven and they all wept before the Lord, and cried unto him to deliver their fathers from the hand of the king of Egypt.",
        "52:28": "And Jacob wrote a record to the king of Egypt and gave it into the hand of Judah and into the hands of his sons for the king of Egypt, saying,",
        "52:29": "From thy servant Jacob, son of Isaac, son of Abraham the Hebrew, the prince of God, to the powerful and wise king, the revealer of secrets, king of Egypt, greeting.",
        "52:30": "Be it known to my lord the king of Egypt, the famine was sore upon us in the land of Canaan, and I sent my sons to thee to buy us a little food from thee for our support.",
        "52:31": "For my sons surrounded me and I being very old cannot see with my eyes, for my eyes have become very heavy through age, as well as with daily weeping for my son, for Joseph who was lost from before me, and I commanded my sons that they should not enter the gates of the city when they came to Egypt, on account of the inhabitants of the land.",
        "52:32": "And I also commanded them to go about Egypt to seek for my son Joseph, perhaps they might find him there, and they did so, and thou didst consider them as spies of the land.",
        "52:33": "Have we not heard concerning thee that thou didst interpret Pharaoh's dream and didst speak truly unto him? how then dost thou not know in thy wisdom whether my sons are spies or not?",
        "52:34": "Now therefore, my lord and king, behold I have sent my son before thee, as thou didst speak unto my sons; I beseech thee to put thy eyes upon him until he is returned to me in peace with his brethren.",
        "52:35": "For dost thou not know, or hast thou not heard that which our God did unto Pharaoh when he took my mother Sarah, and what he did unto Abimelech king of the Philistines on account of her, and also what our father Abraham did unto the nine kings of Elam, how he smote them all with a few men that were with him?",
        "52:36": "And also what my two sons Simeon and Levi did unto the eight cities of the Amorites, how they destroyed them on account of their sister Dinah?",
        "52:37": "And also on account of their brother Benjamin they consoled themselves for the loss of his brother Joseph; what will they then do for him when they see the hand of any people prevailing over them, for his sake?",
        "52:38": "Dost thou not know, O king of Egypt, that the power of God is with us, and that also God ever heareth our prayers and forsaketh us not all the days?",
        "52:39": "And when my sons told me of thy dealings with them, I called not unto the Lord on account of thee, for then thou wouldst have perished with thy men before my son Benjamin came before thee, but I thought that as Simeon my son was in thy house, perhaps thou mightest deal kindly with him, therefore I did not this thing unto thee.",
        "52:40": "Now therefore behold Benjamin my son cometh unto thee with my sons, take heed of him and put thy eyes upon him, and then will God place his eyes over thee and throughout thy kingdom.",
        "52:41": "Now I have told thee all that is in my heart, and behold my sons are coming to thee with their brother, examine the face of the whole earth for their sake and send them back in peace with their brethren.",
        "52:42": "And Jacob gave the record to his sons into the care of Judah to give it unto the king of Egypt.",
        "53:1": "And the sons of Jacob rose up and took Benjamin and the whole of the presents, and they went and came to Egypt and they stood before Joseph.",
        "53:2": "And Joseph beheld his brother Benjamin with them and he saluted them, and these men came to Joseph's house.",
        "53:3": "And Joseph commanded the superintendent of his house to give to his brethren to eat, and he did so unto them.",
        "53:4": "And at noon time Joseph sent for the men to come before him with Benjamin, and the men told the superintendent of Joseph's house concerning the silver that was returned in their sacks, and he said unto them, It will be well with you, fear not, and he brought their brother Simeon unto them.",
        "53:5": "And Simeon said unto his brethren, The lord of the Egyptians has acted very kindly unto me, he did not keep me bound, as you saw with your eyes, for when you went out from the city he let me free and dealt kindly with me in his house.",
        "53:6": "And Judah took Benjamin by the hand, and they came before Joseph, and they bowed down to him to the ground.",
        "53:7": "And the men gave the present unto Joseph and they all sat before him, and Joseph said unto them, Is it well with you, is it well with your children, is it well with your aged father? and they said, It is well, and Judah took the record which Jacob had sent and gave it into the hand of Joseph.",
        "53:8": "And Joseph read the letter and knew his father's writing, and he wished to weep and he went into an inner room and he wept a great weeping; and he went out.",
        "53:9": "And he lifted up his eyes and beheld his brother Benjamin, and he said, Is this your brother of whom you spoke unto me? And Benjamin approached Joseph, and Joseph placed his hand upon his head and he said unto him, May God be gracious unto thee my son.",
        "53:10": "And when Joseph saw his brother, the son of his mother, he again wished to weep, and he entered the chamber, and he wept there, and he washed his face, and went out and refrained from weeping, and he said, Prepare food.",
        "53:11": "And Joseph had a cup from which he drank, and it was of silver beautifully inlaid with onyx stones and bdellium, and Joseph struck the cup in the sight of his brethren whilst they were sitting to eat with him.",
        "53:12": "And Joseph said unto the men, I know by this cup that Reuben the first born, Simeon and Levi and Judah, Issachar and Zebulun are children from one mother, seat yourselves to eat according to your births.",
        "53:13": "And he also placed the others according to their births, and he said, I know that this your youngest brother has no brother, and I, like him, have no brother, he shall therefore sit down to eat with me.",
        "53:14": "And Benjamin went up before Joseph and sat upon the throne, and the men beheld the acts of Joseph, and they were astonished at them; and the men ate and drank at that time with Joseph, and he then gave presents unto them, and Joseph gave one gift unto Benjamin, and Manasseh and Ephraim saw the acts of their father, and they also gave presents unto him, and Osnath gave him one present, and they were five presents in the hand of Benjamin.",
        "53:15": "And Joseph brought them out wine to drink, and they would not drink, and they said, From the day on which Joseph was lost we have not drunk wine, nor eaten any delicacies.",

        "53:17": "And Joseph said unto him, Hast thou begotten any children? and he said, Thy servant has ten sons, and these are their names, Bela, Becher, Ashbal, Gera, Naaman, Achi, Rosh, Mupim, Chupim, and Ord, and I called their names after my brother whom I have not seen.",
        "53:18": "And he ordered them to bring before him his map of the stars, whereby Joseph knew all the times, and Joseph said unto Benjamin, I have heard that the Hebrews are acquainted with all wisdom, dost thou know anything of this?",
        "53:19": "And Benjamin said, Thy servant is knowing also in all the wisdom which my father taught me, and Joseph said unto Benjamin, Look now at this instrument and understand where thy brother Joseph is in Egypt, who you said went down to Egypt.",
        "53:20": "And Benjamin beheld that instrument with the map of the stars of heaven, and he was wise and looked therein to know where his brother was, and Benjamin divided the whole land of Egypt into four divisions, and he found that he who was sitting upon the throne before him was his brother Joseph, and Benjamin wondered greatly, and when Joseph saw that his brother Benjamin was so much astonished, he said unto Benjamin, What hast thou seen, and why art thou astonished?",
        "53:21": "And Benjamin said unto Joseph, I can see by this that Joseph my brother sitteth here with me upon the throne, and Joseph said unto him, I am Joseph thy brother, reveal not this thing unto thy brethren; behold I will send thee with them when they go away, and I will command them to be brought back again into the city, and I will take thee away from them.",
        "53:22": "And if they dare their lives and fight for thee, then shall I know that they have repented of what they did unto me, and I will make myself known to them, and if they forsake thee when I take thee, then shalt thou remain with me, and I will wrangle with them, and they shall go away, and I will not become known to them.",
        "53:23": "At that time Joseph commanded his officer to fill their sacks with food, and to put each man's money into his sack, and to put the cup in the sack of Benjamin, and to give them provision for the road, and they did so unto them.",
        "53:24": "And on the next day the men rose up early in the morning, and they loaded their asses with their corn, and they went forth with Benjamin, and they went to the land of Canaan with their brother Benjamin.",

        "53:27": "And they hastened and each man brought down his sack from his ass, and they looked in their bags and the cup was found in Benjamin's bag, and they all tore their garments and they returned to the city, and they smote Benjamin in the road, continually smiting him until he came into the city, and they stood before Joseph.",

        "53:30": "And Joseph said unto them, What is this act that you have done, that you took away my silver cup and went away? but I know that you took my cup in order to know thereby in what part of the land your brother was.",
        "53:31": "And Judah said, What shall we say to our lord, what shall we speak and how shall we justify ourselves, God has this day found the iniquity of all thy servants, therefore has he done this thing to us this day.",
        "53:32": "And Joseph rose up and caught hold of Benjamin and took him from his brethren with violence, and he came to the house and locked the door at them, and Joseph commanded him that was set over his house that he should say unto them, Thus saith the king, Go in peace to your father, behold I have taken the man in whose hand my cup was found.",

        "54:2": "And Judah said unto Joseph, Let it not seem grievous in the sight of my lord, may thy servant I pray thee speak a word before thee? and Joseph said unto him, Speak.",
        "54:3": "And Judah spoke before Joseph, and his brethren were there standing before them; and Judah said unto Joseph, Surely when we first came to our lord to buy food, thou didst consider us as spies of the land, and we brought Benjamin before thee, and thou still makest sport of us this day.",
        "54:4": "Now therefore let the king hear my words, and send I pray thee our brother that he may go along with us to our father, lest thy soul perish this day with all the souls of the inhabitants of Egypt.",
        "54:5": "Dost thou not know what two of my brethren, Simeon and Levi, did unto the city of Shechem, and unto seven cities of the Amorites, on account of our sister Dinah, and also what they would do for the sake of their brother Benjamin?",
        "54:6": "And I with my strength, who am greater and mightier than both of them, come this day upon thee and thy land if thou art unwilling to send our brother.",
        "54:7": "Hast thou not heard what our God who made choice of us did unto Pharaoh on account of Sarah our mother, whom he took away from our father, that he smote him and his household with heavy plagues, that even unto this day the Egyptians relate this wonder to each other? so will our God do unto thee on account of Benjamin whom thou hast this day taken from his father, and on account of the evils which thou this day heapest over us in thy land; for our God will remember his covenant with our father Abraham and bring evil upon thee, because thou hast grieved the soul of our father this day.",
        "54:8": "Now therefore hear my words that I have this day spoken unto thee, and send our brother that he may go away lest thou and the people of thy land die by the sword, for you cannot all prevail over me.",
        "54:9": "And Joseph answered Judah, saying, Why hast thou opened wide thy mouth and why dost thou boast over us, saying, Strength is with thee? as Pharaoh liveth, if I command all my valiant men to fight with you, surely thou and these thy brethren would sink in the mire.",
        "54:10": "And Judah said unto Joseph, Surely it becometh thee and thy people to fear me; as the Lord liveth if I once draw my sword I shall not sheathe it again until I shall this day have slain all Egypt, and I will commence with thee and finish with Pharaoh thy master.",
        "54:11": "And Joseph answered and said unto him, Surely strength belongeth not alone to thee; I am stronger and mightier than thou, surely if thou drawest thy sword I will put it to thy neck and the necks of all thy brethren.",
        "54:12": "And Judah said unto him, Surely if I this day open my mouth against thee I would swallow thee up that thou be destroyed from off the earth and perish this day from thy kingdom. And Joseph said, Surely if thou openest thy mouth I have power and might to close thy mouth with a stone until thou shalt not be able to utter a word; see how many stones are before us, truly I can take a stone, and force it into thy mouth and break thy jaws.",
        "54:13": "And Judah said, God is witness between us, that we have not hitherto desired to battle with thee, only give us our brother and we will go from thee; and Joseph answered and said, As Pharaoh liveth, if all the kings of Canaan came together with you, you should not take him from my hand.",
        "54:14": "Now therefore go your way to your father, and your brother shall be unto me for a slave, for he has robbed the king's house. And Judah said, What is it to thee or to the character of the king, surely the king sendeth forth from his house, throughout the land, silver and gold either in gifts or expenses, and thou still talkest about thy cup which thou didst place in our brother's bag and sayest that he has stolen it from thee?",
        "54:15": "God forbid that our brother Benjamin or any of the seed of Abraham should do this thing to steal from thee, or from any one else, whether king, prince, or any man.",
        "54:16": "Now therefore cease this accusation lest the whole earth hear thy words, saying, For a little silver the king of Egypt wrangled with the men, and he accused them and took their brother for a slave.",
        "54:17": "And Joseph answered and said, Take unto you this cup and go from me and leave your brother for a slave, for it is the judgment of a thief to be a slave.",
        "54:18": "And Judah said, Why art thou not ashamed of thy words, to leave our brother and to take thy cup? Surely if thou givest us thy cup, or a thousand times as much, we will not leave our brother for the silver which is found in the hand of any man, that we will not die over him.",
        "54:19": "And Joseph answered, And why did you forsake your brother and sell him for twenty pieces of silver unto this day, and why then will you not do the same to this your brother?",
        "54:20": "And Judah said, the Lord is witness between me and thee that we desire not thy battles; now therefore give us our brother and we will go from thee without quarreling.",
        "54:21": "And Joseph answered and said, If all the kings of the land should assemble they will not be able to take your brother from my hand; and Judah said, What shall we say unto our father, when he seeth that our brother cometh not with us, and will grieve over him?",
        "54:22": "And Joseph answered and said, This is the thing which you shall tell unto your father, saying, The rope has gone after the bucket.",
        "54:23": "And Judah said, Surely thou art a king, and why speakest thou these things, giving a false judgment? woe unto the king who is like unto thee.",
        "54:24": "And Joseph answered and said, There is no false judgment in the word that I spoke on account of your brother Joseph, for all of you sold him to the Midianites for twenty pieces of silver, and you all denied it to your father and said unto him, An evil beast has devoured him, Joseph has been torn to pieces.",
        "54:25": "And Judah said, Behold the fire of Shem burneth in my heart, now I will burn all your land with fire; and Joseph answered and said, Surely thy sister-in-law Tamar, who killed your sons, extinguished the fire of Shechem.",
        "54:26": "And Judah said, If I pluck out a single hair from my flesh, I will fill all Egypt with its blood.",
        "54:27": "And Joseph answered and said, Such is your custom to do as you did to your brother whom you sold, and you dipped his coat in blood and brought it to your father in order that he might say an evil beast devoured him and here is his blood.",
        "54:28": "And when Judah heard this thing he was exceedingly wroth and his anger burned within him, and there was before him in that place a stone, the weight of which was about four hundred shekels, and Judah's anger was kindled and he took the stone in one hand and cast it to the heavens and caught it with his left hand.",
        "54:29": "And he placed it afterward under his legs, and he sat upon it with all his strength and the stone was turned into dust from the force of Judah.",
        "54:30": "And Joseph saw the act of Judah and he was very much afraid, but he commanded Manassah his son and he also did with another stone like unto the act of Judah, and Judah said unto his brethren, Let not any of you say, this man is an Egyptian, but by his doing this thing he is of our father's family.",
        "54:31": "And Joseph said, Not to you only is strength given, for we are also powerful men, and why will you boast over us all? and Judah said unto Joseph, Send I pray thee our brother and ruin not thy country this day.",
        "54:32": "And Joseph answered and said unto them, Go and tell your father, an evil beast hath devoured him as you said concerning your brother Joseph.",
        "54:33": "And Judah spoke to his brother Naphtali, and he said unto him, Make haste, go now and number all the streets of Egypt and come and tell me; and Simeon said unto him, Let not this thing be a trouble to thee; now I will go to the mount and take up one large stone from the mount and level it at every one in Egypt, and kill all that are in it.",
        "54:34": "And Joseph heard all these words that his brethren spoke before him, and they did not know that Joseph understood them, for they imagined that he knew not to speak Hebrew.",
        "54:35": "And Joseph was greatly afraid at the words of his brethren lest they should destroy Egypt, and he commanded his son Manasseh, saying, Go now make haste and gather unto me all the inhabitants of Egypt, and all the valiant men together, and let them come to me now upon horseback and on foot and with all sorts of musical instruments, and Manasseh went and did so.",
        "54:36": "And Naphtali went as Judah had commanded him, for Naphtali was lightfooted as one of the swift stags, and he would go upon the ears of corn and they would not break under him.",
        "54:37": "And he went and numbered all the streets of Egypt, and found them to be twelve, and he came hastily and told Judah, and Judah said unto his brethren, Hasten you and put on every man his sword upon his loins and we will come over Egypt, and smite them all, and let not a remnant remain.",
        "54:38": "And Judah said, Behold, I will destroy three of the streets with my strength, and you shall each destroy one street; and when Judah was speaking this thing, behold the inhabitants of Egypt and all the mighty men came toward them with all sorts of musical instruments and with loud shouting.",
        "54:39": "And their number was five hundred cavalry and ten thousand infantry, and four hundred men who could fight without sword or spear, only with their hands and strength.",
        "54:40": "And all the mighty men came with great storming and shouting, and they all surrounded the sons of Jacob and terrified them, and the ground quaked at the sound of their shouting.",
        "54:41": "And when the sons of Jacob saw these troops they were greatly afraid of their lives, and Joseph did so in order to terrify the sons of Jacob to become tranquilized.",
        "54:42": "And Judah, seeing some of his brethren terrified, said unto them, Why are you afraid whilst the grace of God is with us? and when Judah saw all the people of Egypt surrounding them at the command of Joseph to terrify them, only Joseph commanded them, saying, Do not touch any of them.",
        "54:43": "Then Judah hastened and drew his sword, and uttered a loud and bitter scream, and he smote with his sword, and he sprang upon the ground and he still continued to shout against all the people.",
        "54:44": "And when he did this thing the Lord caused the terror of Judah and his brethren to fall upon the valiant men and all the people that surrounded them.",
        "54:45": "And they all fled at the sound of the shouting, and they were terrified and fell one upon the other, and many of them died as they fell, and they all fled from before Judah and his brethren and from before Joseph.",
        "54:46": "And whilst they were fleeing, Judah and his brethren pursued them unto the house of Pharaoh, and they all escaped, and Judah again sat before Joseph and roared at him like a lion, and gave a great and tremendous shriek at him.",
        "54:47": "And the shriek was heard at a distance, and all the inhabitants of Succoth heard it, and all Egypt quaked at the sound of the shriek, and also the walls of Egypt and of the land of Goshen fell in from the shaking of the earth, and Pharaoh also fell from his throne upon the ground, and also all the pregnant women of Egypt and Goshen miscarried when they heard the noise of the shaking, for they were terribly afraid.",
        "54:48": "And Pharaoh sent word, saying, What is this thing that has this day happened in the land of Egypt? and they came and told him all the things from beginning to end, and Pharaoh was alarmed and he wondered and was greatly afraid.",
        "54:49": "And his fright increased when he heard all these things, and he sent unto Joseph, saying, Thou hast brought unto me the Hebrews to destroy all Egypt; what wilt thou do with that thievish slave? send him away and let him go with his brethren, and let us not perish through their evil, even we, you and all Egypt.",
        "54:50": "And if thou desirest not to do this thing, cast off from thee all my valuable things, and go with them to their land, if thou delightest in it, for they will this day destroy my whole country and slay all my people; even all the women of Egypt have miscarried through their screams; see what they have done merely by their shouting and speaking, moreover if they fight with the sword, they will destroy the land; now therefore choose that which thou desirest, whether me or the Hebrews, whether Egypt or the land of the Hebrews.",
        "54:51": "And they came and told Joseph all the words of Pharaoh that he had said concerning him, and Joseph was greatly afraid at the words of Pharaoh and Judah and his brethren were still standing before Joseph indignant and enraged, and all the sons of Jacob roared at Joseph, like the roaring of the sea and its waves.",
        "54:52": "And Joseph was greatly afraid of his brethren and on account of Pharaoh, and Joseph sought a pretext to make himself known unto his brethren, lest they should destroy all Egypt.",
        "54:53": "And Joseph commanded his son Manasseh, and Manasseh went and approached Judah, and placed his hand upon his shoulder, and the anger of Judah was stilled.",
        "54:54": "And Judah said unto his brethren, Let no one of you say that this is the act of an Egyptian youth for this is the work of my father's house.",
        "54:55": "And Joseph seeing and knowing that Judah's anger was stilled, he approached to speak unto Judah in the language of mildness.",
        "54:56": "And Joseph said unto Judah, Surely you speak truth and have this day verified your assertions concerning your strength, and may your God who delighteth in you, increase your welfare; but tell me truly why from amongst all thy brethren dost thou wrangle with me on account of the lad, as none of them have spoken one word to me concerning him.",
        "54:57": "And Judah answered Joseph, saying, Surely thou must know that I was security for the lad to his father, saying, If I brought him not unto him I should bear his blame forever.",
        "54:58": "Therefore have I approached thee from amongst all my brethren, for I saw that thou wast unwilling to suffer him to go from thee; now therefore may I find grace in thy sight that thou shalt send him to go with us, and behold I will remain as a substitute for him, to serve thee in whatever thou desirest, for wheresoever thou shalt send me I will go to serve thee with great energy.",
        "54:59": "Send me now to a mighty king who has rebelled against thee, and thou shalt know what I will do unto him and unto his land; although he may have cavalry and infantry or an exceeding mighty people, I will slay them all and bring the king's head before thee.",
        "54:60": "Dost thou not know or hast thou not heard that our father Abraham with his servant Eliezer smote all the kings of Elam with their hosts in one night, they left not one remaining? and ever since that day our father's strength was given unto us for an inheritance, for us and our seed forever.",
        "54:61": "And Joseph answered and said, You speak truth, and falsehood is not in your mouth, for it was also told unto us that the Hebrews have power and that the Lord their God delighteth much in them, and who then can stand before them?",
        "54:62": "However, on this condition will I send your brother, if you will bring before me his brother the son of his mother, of whom you said that he had gone from you down to Egypt; and it shall come to pass when you bring unto me his brother I will take him in his stead, because not one of you was security for him to your father, and when he shall come unto me, I will then send with you his brother for whom you have been security.",
        "54:63": "And Judah's anger was kindled against Joseph when he spoke this thing, and his eyes dropped blood with anger, and he said unto his brethren, How doth this man this day seek his own destruction and that of all Egypt!",
        "54:64": "And Simeon answered Joseph, saying, Did we not tell thee at first that we knew not the particular spot to which he went, and whether he be dead or alive, and wherefore speaketh my lord like unto these things?",
        "54:65": "And Joseph observing the countenance of Judah discerned that his anger began to kindle when he spoke unto him, saying, Bring unto me your other brother instead of this brother.",
        "54:66": "And Joseph said unto his brethren, Surely you said that your brother was either dead or lost, now if I should call him this day and he should come before you, would you give him unto me instead of his brother?",
        "54:67": "And Joseph began to speak and call out, Joseph, Joseph, come this day before me, and appear to thy brethren and sit before them.",
        "54:68": "And when Joseph spoke this thing before them, they looked each a different way to see from whence Joseph would come before them.",
        "54:69": "And Joseph observed all their acts, and said unto them, Why do you look here and there? I am Joseph whom you sold to Egypt, now therefore let it not grieve you that you sold me, for as a support during the famine did God send me before you.",
        "54:70": "And his brethren were terrified at him when they heard the words of Joseph, and Judah was exceedingly terrified at him.",
        "54:71": "And when Benjamin heard the words of Joseph he was before them in the inner part of the house, and Benjamin ran unto Joseph his brother, and embraced him and fell upon his neck, and they wept.",
        "54:72": "And when Joseph's brethren saw that Benjamin had fallen upon his brother's neck and wept with him, they also fell upon Joseph and embraced him, and they wept a great weeping with Joseph.",
        "54:73": "And the voice was heard in the house of Joseph that they were Joseph's brethren, and it pleased Pharaoh exceedingly, for he was afraid of them lest they should destroy Egypt.",
        "54:74": "And Pharaoh sent his servants unto Joseph to congratulate him concerning his brethren who had come to him, and all the captains of the armies and troops that were in Egypt came to rejoice with Joseph, and all Egypt rejoiced greatly about Joseph's brethren.",
        "54:75": "And Pharaoh sent his servants to Joseph, saying, Tell thy brethren to fetch all belonging to them and let them come unto me, and I will place them in the best part of the land of Egypt, and they did so.",
        "54:76": "And Joseph commanded him that was set over his house to bring out to his brethren gifts and garments, and he brought out to them many garments being robes of royalty and many gifts, and Joseph divided them amongst his brethren.",
        "54:77": "And he gave unto each of his brethren a change of garments of gold and silver, and three hundred pieces of silver, and Joseph commanded them all to be dressed in these garments, and to be brought before Pharaoh.",
        "54:78": "And Pharaoh seeing that all Joseph's brethren were valiant men, and of beautiful appearance, he greatly rejoiced.",
        "54:79": "And they afterward went out from the presence of Pharaoh to go to the land of Canaan, to their father, and their brother Benjamin was with them.",
        "54:80": "And Joseph rose up and gave unto them eleven chariots from Pharaoh, and Joseph gave unto them his chariot, upon which he rode on the day of his being crowned in Egypt, to fetch his father to Egypt; and Joseph sent to all his brothers' children, garments according to their numbers, and a hundred pieces of silver to each of them, and he also sent garments to the wives of his brethren from the garments of the king's wives, and he sent them.",
        "54:81": "And he gave unto each of his brethren ten men to go with them to the land of Canaan to serve them, to serve their children and all belonging to them in coming to Egypt.",
        "54:82": "And Joseph sent by the hand of his brother Benjamin ten suits of garments for his ten sons, a portion above the rest of the children of the sons of Jacob.",
        "54:83": "And he sent to each fifty pieces of silver, and ten chariots on the account of Pharaoh, and he sent to his father ten asses laden with all the luxuries of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and nourishment for his father, and to all that were with him as provisions for the road.",
        "54:84": "And he sent to his sister Dinah garments of silver and gold, and frankincense and myrrh, and aloes and women's ornaments in great plenty, and he sent the same from the wives of Pharaoh to the wives of Benjamin.",
        "54:85": "And he gave unto all his brethren, also to their wives, all sorts of onyx stones and bdellium, and from all the valuable things amongst the great people of Egypt, nothing of all the costly things was left but what Joseph sent of to his father's household.",
        "54:86": "And he sent his brethren away, and they went, and he sent his brother Benjamin with them.",
        "54:87": "And Joseph went out with them to accompany them on the road unto the borders of Egypt, and he commanded them concerning his father and his household, to come to Egypt.",
        "54:88": "And he said unto them, Do not quarrel on the road, for this thing was from the Lord to keep a great people from starvation, for there will be yet five years of famine in the land.",
        "54:89": "And he commanded them, saying, When you come unto the land of Canaan, do not come suddenly before my father in this affair, but act in your wisdom.",
        "54:90": "And Joseph ceased to command them, and he turned and went back to Egypt, and the sons of Jacob went to the land of Canaan with joy and cheerfulness to their father Jacob.",
        "54:91": "And they came unto the borders of the land, and they said to each other, What shall we do in this matter before our father, for if we come suddenly to him and tell him the matter, he will be greatly alarmed at our words and will not believe us.",
        "54:92": "And they went along until they came nigh unto their houses, and they found Serach, the daughter of Asher, going forth to meet them, and the damsel was very good and subtle, and knew how to play upon the harp.",

        "56:51": "And Joseph and his brethren heard the words of Esau's sons, and they were exceedingly wroth, and Joseph approached unto Esau, saying, What is this thing which they have spoken? surely my father Jacob bought it from thee for great riches after the death of Isaac, now five and twenty years ago, and also all the land of Canaan he bought from thee and from thy sons, and thy seed after thee.",
        "56:52": "And Jacob bought it for his sons and his seed after him for an inheritance for ever, and why speakest thou these things this day?",
        "56:53": "And Esau answered, saying, Thou speakest falsely and utterest lies, for I sold not anything belonging to me in all this land, as thou sayest, neither did my brother Jacob buy aught belonging to me in this land.",
        "56:54": "And Esau spoke these things in order to deceive Joseph with his words, for Esau knew that Joseph was not present in those days when Esau sold all belonging to him in the land of Canaan to Jacob.",
        "56:55": "And Joseph said unto Esau, Surely my father inserted these things with thee in the record of purchase, and testified the record with witnesses, and behold it is with us in Egypt.",
        "56:56": "And Esau answered, saying unto him, Bring the record, all that thou wilt find in the record, so will we do.",
        "56:57": "And Joseph called unto Naphtali his brother, and he said, Hasten quickly, stay not, and run I pray thee to Egypt and bring all the records; the record of the purchase, the sealed record and the open record, and also all the first records in which all the transactions of the birth-right are written, fetch thou.",
        "56:58": "And thou shalt bring them unto us hither, that we may know from them all the words of Esau and his sons which they spoke this day.",
        "56:59": "And Naphtali hearkened to the voice of Joseph and he hastened and ran to go down to Egypt, and Naphtali was lighter on foot than any of the stags that were upon the wilderness, for he would go upon ears of corn without crushing them.",
        "56:60": "And when Esau saw that Naphtali had gone to fetch the records, he and his sons increased their resistance against the cave, and Esau and all his people rose up against Joseph and his brethren to battle.",
        "56:61": "And all the sons of Jacob and the people of Egypt fought with Esau and his men, and the sons of Esau and his people were smitten before the sons of Jacob, and the sons of Jacob slew of Esau's people forty men.",
        "56:62": "And Chushim the son of Dan, the son of Jacob, was at that time with Jacob's sons, but he was about a hundred cubits distant from the place of battle, for he remained with the children of Jacob's sons by Jacob's bier to guard it.",
        "56:63": "And Chushim was dumb and deaf, still he understood the voice of consternation amongst men.",
        "56:64": "And he asked, saying, Why do you not bury the dead, and what is this great consternation? and they answered him the words of Esau and his sons; and he ran to Esau in the midst of the battle, and he slew Esau with a sword, and he cut off his head, and it sprang to a distance, and Esau fell amongst the people of the battle.",
        "56:65": "And when Chushim did this thing the sons of Jacob prevailed over the sons of Esau, and the sons of Jacob buried their father Jacob by force in the cave, and the sons of Esau beheld it.",
        "56:66": "And Jacob was buried in Hebron, in the cave of Machpelah which Abraham had bought from the sons of Heth for the possession of a burial place, and he was buried in very costly garments.",
        "56:67": "And no king had such honor paid him as Joseph paid unto his father at his death, for he buried him with great honor like unto the burial of kings.",
        "56:68": "And Joseph and his brethren made a mourning of seven days for their father.",
        "57:1": "And it was after this that the sons of Esau waged war with the sons of Jacob, and the sons of Esau fought with the sons of Jacob in Hebron, and Esau was still lying dead, and not buried.",
        "57:2": "And the battle was heavy between them, and the sons of Esau were smitten before the sons of Jacob, and the sons of Jacob slew of the sons of Esau eighty men, and not one died of the people of the sons of Jacob; and the hand of Joseph prevailed over all the people of the sons of Esau, and he took Zepho, the son of Eliphaz, the son of Esau, and fifty of his men captive, and he bound them with chains of iron, and gave them into the hand of his servants to bring them to Egypt.",
        "57:3": "And it came to pass when the sons of Jacob had taken Zepho and his people captive, all those that remained were greatly afraid of their lives from the house of Esau, lest they should also be taken captive, and they all fled with Eliphaz the son of Esau and his people, with Esau's body, and they went on their road to Mount Seir.",
        "57:4": "And they came unto Mount Seir and they buried Esau in Seir, but they had not brought his head with them to Seir, for it was buried in that place where the battle had been in Hebron.",
        "57:5": "And it came to pass when the sons of Esau had fled from before the sons of Jacob, the sons of Jacob pursued them unto the borders of Seir, but they did not slay a single man from amongst them when they pursued them, for Esau's body which they carried with them excited their confusion, so they fled and the sons of Jacob turned back from them and came up to the place where their brethren were in Hebron, and they remained there on that day, and on the next day until they rested from the battle.",
        "57:6": "And it came to pass on the third day they assembled all the sons of Seir the Horite, and they assembled all the children of the east, a multitude of people like the sand of the sea, and they went and came down to Egypt to fight with Joseph and his brethren, in order to deliver their brethren.",

        "60:29": "And the inhabitants of Bibentu heard of his fame and they were greatly afraid of him, and they went forth to meet him with weeping and supplication, and the inhabitants of Bibentu entreated of Angeas not to slay them nor destroy their city; and he did so, for Bibentu was in those days reckoned as one of the cities of the children of Chittim; therefore he did not destroy the city.",
        "60:30": "But from that day forward the troops of the king of Africa would go to Chittim to spoil and plunder it, and whenever they went, Zepho the captain of the host of Angeas would go with them.",
        "60:31": "And it was after this that Angeas turned with his army and they came to the city of Puzimna, and Angeas took thence Jania the daughter of Uzu for a wife and brought her unto his city unto Africa.",

        "61:5": "And Zepho the son of Eliphaz the son of Esau, captain of the host to Angeas king of Dinhabah, was still daily enticing Angeas to prepare for battle to fight with the sons of Jacob in Egypt, and Angeas was unwilling to do this thing, for his servants had related to him all the might of the sons of Jacob, what they had done unto them in their battle with the children of Esau.",
        "61:6": "And Zepho was in those days daily enticing Angeas to fight with the sons of Jacob in those days.",
        "61:7": "And after some time Angeas hearkened to the words of Zepho and consented to him to fight with the sons of Jacob in Egypt, and Angeas got all his people in order, a people numerous as the sand which is upon the sea shore, and he formed his resolution to go to Egypt to battle.",
        "61:8": "And amongst the servants of Angeas was a youth fifteen years old, Balaam the son of Beor was his name and the youth was very wise and understood the art of witchcraft.",
        "61:9": "And Angeas said unto Balaam, Conjure for us, I pray thee, with the witchcraft, that we may know who will prevail in this battle to which we are now proceeding.",
        "61:10": "And Balaam ordered that they should bring him wax, and he made thereof the likeness of chariots and horsemen representing the army of Angeas and the army of Egypt, and he put them in the cunningly prepared waters that he had for that purpose, and he took in his hand the boughs of myrtle trees, and he exercised his cunning, and he joined them over the water, and there appeared unto him in the water the resembling images of the hosts of Angeas falling before the resembling images of the Egyptians and the sons of Jacob.",
        "61:11": "And Balaam told this thing to Angeas, and Angeas despaired and did not arm himself to go down to Egypt to battle, and he remained in his city.",
        "61:12": "And when Zepho the son of Eliphaz saw that Angeas despaired of going forth to battle with the Egyptians, Zepho fled from Angeas from Africa, and he went and came unto Chittim.",
        "61:13": "And all the people of Chittim received him with great honor, and they hired him to fight their battles all the days, and Zepho became exceedingly rich in those days, and the troops of the king of Africa still spread themselves in those days, and the children of Chittim assembled and went to Mount Cuptizia on account of the troops of Angeas king of Africa, who were advancing upon them.",
        "61:14": "And it was one day that Zepho lost a young heifer, and he went to seek it, and he heard it lowing round about the mountain.",
        "61:15": "And Zepho went and he saw and behold there was a large cave at the bottom of the mountain, and there was a great stone there at the entrance of the cave, and Zepho split the stone and he came into the cave and he looked and behold, a large animal was devouring the ox; from the middle upward it resembled a man, and from the middle downward it resembled an animal, and Zepho rose up against the animal and slew it with his swords.",
        "61:16": "And the inhabitants of Chittim heard of this thing, and they rejoiced exceedingly, and they said, What shall we do unto this man who has slain this animal that devoured our cattle?",
        "61:17": "And they all assembled to consecrate one day in the year to him, and they called the name thereof Zepho after his name, and they brought unto him drink offerings year after year on that day, and they brought unto him gifts.",
        "61:18": "At that time Jania the daughter of Uzu wife of king Angeas became ill, and her illness was heavily felt by Angeas and his officers, and Angeas said unto his wise men, What shall I do to Jania and how shall I heal her from her illness? And his wise men said unto him, Because the air of our country is not like the air of the land of Chittim, and our water is not like their water, therefore from this has the queen become ill.",
        "61:19": "For through the change of air and water she became ill, and also because in her country she drank only the water which came from Purmah, which her ancestors had brought up with bridges.",
        "61:20": "And Angeas commanded his servants, and they brought unto him in vessels of the waters of Purmah belonging to Chittim, and they weighed those waters with all the waters of the land of Africa, and they found those waters lighter than the waters of Africa.",
        "61:21": "And Angeas saw this thing, and he commanded all his officers to assemble the hewers of stone in thousands and tens of thousands, and they hewed stone without number, and the builders came and they built an exceedingly strong bridge, and they conveyed the spring of water from the land of Chittim unto Africa, and those waters were for Jania the queen and for all her concerns, to drink from and to bake, wash and bathe therewith, and also to water therewith all seed from which food can be obtained, and all fruit of the ground.",
        "61:22": "And the king commanded that they should bring of the soil of Chittim in large ships, and they also brought stones to build therewith, and the builders built palaces for Jania the queen, and the queen became healed of her illness.",
        "61:23": "And at the revolution of the year the troops of Africa continued coming to the land of Chittim to plunder as usual, and Zepho son of Eliphaz heard their report, and he gave orders concerning them and he fought with them, and they fled before him, and he delivered the land of Chittim from them.",
        "61:24": "And the children of Chittim saw the valor of Zepho, and the children of Chittim resolved and they made Zepho king over them, and he became king over them, and whilst he reigned they went to subdue the children of Tubal, and all the surrounding islands.",
        "61:25": "And their king Zepho went at their head and they made war with Tubal and the islands, and they subdued them, and when they returned from the battle they renewed his government for him, and they built for him a very large palace for his royal habitation and seat, and they made a large throne for him, and Zepho reigned over the whole land of Chittim and over the land of Italia fifty years.",
        "62:1": "In that year, being the seventy-ninth year of the Israelites going down to Egypt, died Reuben the son of Jacob, in the land of Egypt; Reuben was a hundred and twenty-five years old when he died, and they put him into a coffin, and he was given into the hands of his children.",

        "62:6": "And it came to pass in the eighty-fourth year, that is the fiftieth year of the reign of Hadad, son of Bedad, king of Edom, that Hadad assembled all the children of Esau, and he got his whole army in readiness, about four hundred thousand men, and he directed his way to the land of Moab, and he went to fight with Moab and to make them tributary to him.",
        "62:7": "And the children of Moab heard this thing, and they were very much afraid, and they sent to the children of Midian to assist them in fighting with Hadad, son of Bedad, king of Edom.",

        "62:13": "And when all the children of Midian had perished in battle, and the children at Moab had escaped, Hadad made all Moab at that time tributary to him, and they became under his hand, and they gave a yearly tax as it was ordered, and Hadad turned and went back to his land.",
        "62:14": "And at the revolution of the year, when the rest of the people of Midian that were in the land heard that all their brethren had fallen in battle with Hadad for the sake of Moab, because the children of Moab had turned their backs in battle and left Midian to fight, then five of the princes of Midian resolved with the rest of their brethren who remained in their land, to fight with Moab to avenge the cause of their brethren.",

        "64:23": "And the Egyptians believed not in Israel to go with them in their camps together for battle, for all the Egyptians said, Perhaps the children of Israel will deliver us into the hand of the children of Esau and Ishmael, for they are their brethren.",
        "64:24": "And all the Egyptians said unto the children of Israel, Remain you here together in your stand and we will go and fight against the children of Esau and Ishmael, and if these kings should prevail over us, then come you altogether upon them and assist us, and the children of Israel did so.",
        "64:25": "And Zepho the son of Eliphaz the son of Esau king of Chittim, and Hadad the son of Bedad king of Edom, and all their camps, and all the children of the east, and children of Ishmael, a people numerous as sand, encamped together in the valley of Pathros opposite Tachpanches.",
        "64:26": "And Balaam the son of Beor the Syrian was there in the camp of Zepho, for he came with the children of Chittim to the battle, and Balaam was a man highly honored in the eyes of Zepho and his men.",
        "64:27": "And Zepho said unto Balaam, Try by divination for us that we may know who will prevail in the battle, we or the Egyptians.",
        "64:28": "And Balaam rose up and tried the art of divination, and he was skillful in the knowledge of it, but he was confused and the work was destroyed in his hand.",
        "64:29": "And he tried it again but it did not succeed, and Balaam despaired of it and left it and did not complete it, for this was from the Lord, in order to cause Zepho and his people to fall into the hand of the children of Israel, who had trusted in the Lord, the God of their ancestors, in their war.",
        "64:30": "And Zepho and Hadad put their forces in battle array, and all the Egyptians went alone against them, about three hundred thousand men, and not one man of Israel was with them.",
        "64:31": "And all the Egyptians fought with these kings opposite Pathros and Tachpanches, and the battle was severe against the Egyptians.",
        "64:32": "And the kings were stronger than the Egyptians in that battle, and about one hundred and eighty men of Egypt fell on that day, and about thirty men of the forces of the kings, and all the men of Egypt fled from before the kings, so the children of Esau and Ishmael pursued the Egyptians, continuing to smite them unto the place where was the camp of the children of Israel.",
        "64:33": "And all the Egyptians cried unto the children of Israel, saying, Hasten to us and assist us and save us from the hand of Esau, Ishmael and the children of Chittim.",
        "64:34": "And the hundred and fifty men of the children of Israel ran from their station to the camps of these kings, and the children of Israel cried unto the Lord their God to deliver them.",
        "64:35": "And the Lord hearkened to Israel, and the Lord gave all the men of the kings into their hand, and the children of Israel fought against these kings, and the children of Israel smote about four thousand of the kings' men.",
        "64:36": "And the Lord threw a great consternation in the camp of the kings, so that the fear of the children of Israel fell upon them.",
        "64:37": "And all the hosts of the kings fled from before the children of Israel and the children of Israel pursued them continuing to smite them unto the borders of the land of Cush.",
        "64:38": "And the children of Israel slew of them in the road yet two thousand men, and of the children of Israel not one fell.",
        "64:39": "And when the Egyptians saw that the children of Israel had fought with such few men with the kings, and that the battle was so very severe against them,",
        "64:40": "All the Egyptians were greatly afraid of their lives on account of the strong battle, and all Egypt fled, every man hiding himself from the arrayed forces, and they hid themselves in the road, and they left the Israelites to fight.",
        "64:41": "And the children of Israel inflicted a terrible blow upon the kings' men, and they returned from them after they had driven them to the border of the land of Cush.",
        "64:42": "And all Israel knew the thing which the men of Egypt had done to them, that they had fled from them in battle, and had left them to fight alone.",
        "64:43": "So the children of Israel also acted with cunning, and as the children of Israel returned from battle, they found some of the Egyptians in the road and smote them there.",
        "64:44": "And whilst they slew them, they said unto them these words:",
        "64:45": "Wherefore did you go from us and leave us, being a few people, to fight against these kings who had a great people to smite us, that you might thereby deliver your own souls?",
        "64:46": "And of some which the Israelites met on the road, they the children of Israel spoke to each other, saying, Smite, smite, for he is an Ishmaelite, or an Edomite, or from the children of Chittim, and they stood over him and slew him, and they knew that he was an Egyptian.",
        "64:47": "And the children of Israel did these things cunningly against the Egyptians, because they had deserted them in battle and had fled from them.",
        "64:48": "And the children of Israel slew of the men of Egypt in the road in this manner, about two hundred men.",
        "64:49": "And all the men of Egypt saw the evil which the children of Israel had done to them, so all Egypt feared greatly the children of Israel, for they had seen their great power, and that not one man of them had fallen.",
        "64:50": "So all the children of Israel returned with joy on their road to Goshen, and the rest of Egypt returned each man to his place.",
        "65:1": "And it came to pass after these things, that all the counsellors of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and all the elders of Egypt assembled and came before the king and bowed down to the ground, and they sat before him.",
        "65:2": "And the counsellors and elders of Egypt spoke unto the king, saying,",
        "65:3": "Behold the people of the children of Israel is greater and mightier than we are, and thou knowest all the evil which they did to us in the road when we returned from battle.",
        "65:4": "And thou hast also seen their strong power, for this power is unto them from their fathers, for but a few men stood up against a people numerous as the sand, and smote them at the edge of the sword, and of themselves not one has fallen, so that if they had been numerous they would then have utterly destroyed them.",
        "65:5": "Now therefore give us counsel what to do with them, until we gradually destroy them from amongst us, lest they become too numerous for us in the land.",
        "65:6": "For if the children of Israel should increase in the land, they will become an obstacle to us, and if any war should happen to take place, they with their great strength will join our enemy against us, and fight against us, destroy us from the land and go away from it.",
        "65:7": "So the king answered the elders of Egypt and said unto them, This is the plan advised against Israel, from which we will not depart,",
        "65:8": "Behold in the land are Pithom and Rameses, cities unfortified against battle, it behooves you and us to build them, and to fortify them.",
        "65:9": "Now therefore go you also and act cunningly toward them, and proclaim a voice in Egypt and in Goshen at the command of the king, saying,",
        "65:10": "All ye men of Egypt, Goshen, Pathros and all their inhabitants! the king has commanded us to build Pithom and Rameses, and to fortify them for battle; who amongst you of all Egypt, of the children of Israel and of all the inhabitants of the cities, are willing to build with us, shall each have his wages given to him daily at the king's order; so go you first and do cunningly, and gather yourselves and come to Pithom and Rameses to build.",
        "65:11": "And whilst you are building, cause a proclamation of this kind to be made throughout Egypt every day at the command of the king.",
        "65:12": "And when some of the children of Israel shall come to build with you, you shall give them their wages daily for a few days.",
        "65:13": "And after they shall have built with you for their daily hire, drag yourselves away from them daily one by one in secret, and then you shall rise up and become their task-masters and officers, and you shall leave them afterward to build without wages, and should they refuse, then force them with all your might to build.",
        "65:14": "And if you do this it will be well with us to strengthen our land against the children of Israel, for on account of the fatigue of the building and the work, the children of Israel will decrease, because you will deprive them from their wives day by day.",
        "65:15": "And all the elders of Egypt heard the counsel of the king, and the counsel seemed good in their eyes and in the eyes of the servants of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all Egypt, and they did according to the word of the king.",
        "65:16": "And all the servants went away from the king, and they caused a proclamation to be made in all Egypt, in Tachpanches and in Goshen, and in all the cities which surrounded Egypt, saying,",
        "65:17": "You have seen what the children of Esau and Ishmael did to us, who came to war against us and wished to destroy us.",
        "65:18": "Now therefore the king commanded us to fortify the land, to build the cities Pithom and Rameses, and to fortify them for battle, if they should again come against us.",
        "65:19": "Whosoever of you from all Egypt and from the children of Israel will come to build with us, he shall have his daily wages given by the king, as his command is unto us.",
        "65:20": "And when Egypt and all the children of Israel heard all that the servants of Pharaoh had spoken, there came from the Egyptians, and the children of Israel to build with the servants of Pharaoh, Pithom and Rameses, but none of the children of Levi came with their brethren to build.",
        "65:21": "And all the servants of Pharaoh and his princes came at first with deceit to build with all Israel as daily hired laborers, and they gave to Israel their daily hire at the beginning.",
        "65:22": "And the servants of Pharaoh built with all Israel, and were employed in that work with Israel for a month.",
        "65:23": "And at the end of the month, all the servants of Pharaoh began to withdraw secretly from the people of Israel daily.",
        "65:24": "And Israel went on with the work at that time, but they then received their daily hire, because some of the men of Egypt were yet carrying on the work with Israel at that time; therefore the Egyptians gave Israel their hire in those days, in order that they, the Egyptians their fellow-workmen, might also take the pay for their labor.",
        "65:25": "And at the end of a year and four months all the Egyptians had withdrawn from the children of Israel, so that the children of Israel were left alone engaged in the work.",
        "65:26": "And after all the Egyptians had withdrawn from the children of Israel they returned and became oppressors and officers over them, and some of them stood over the children of Israel as task masters, to receive from them all that they gave them for the pay of their labor.",
        "65:27": "And the Egyptians did in this manner to the children of Israel day by day, in order to afflict in their work.",
        "65:28": "And all the children of Israel were alone engaged in the labor, and the Egyptians refrained from giving any pay to the children of Israel from that time forward.",
        "65:29": "And when some of the men of Israel refused to work on account of the wages not being given to them, then the exactors and the servants of Pharaoh oppressed them and smote them with heavy blows, and made them return by force, to labor with their brethren; thus did all the Egyptians unto the children of Israel all the days.",
        "65:30": "And all the children of Israel were greatly afraid of the Egyptians in this matter, and all the children of Israel returned and worked alone without pay.",
        "65:31": "And the children of Israel built Pithom and Rameses, and all the children of Israel did the work, some making bricks, and some building, and the children of Israel built and fortified all the land of Egypt and its walls, and the children of Israel were engaged in work for many years, until the time came when the Lord remembered them and brought them out of Egypt.",
        "65:32": "But the children of Levi were not employed in the work with their brethren of Israel, from the beginning unto the day of their going forth from Egypt.",
        "65:33": "For all the children of Levi knew that the Egyptians had spoken all these words with deceit to the Israelites, therefore the children of Levi refrained from approaching to the work with their brethren.",
        "65:34": "And the Egyptians did not direct their attention to make the children of Levi work afterward, since they had not been with their brethren at the beginning, therefore the Egyptians left them alone.",
        "65:35": "And the hands of the men of Egypt were directed with continued severity against the children of Israel in that work, and the Egyptians made the children of Israel work with rigor.",
        "65:36": "And the Egyptians embittered the lives of the children of Israel with hard work, in mortar and bricks, and also in all manner of work in the field.",
        "65:37": "And the children of Israel called Melol the king of Egypt \"Meror, king of Egypt,\" because in his days the Egyptians had embittered their lives with all manner of work.",
        "65:38": "And all the work wherein the Egyptians made the children of Israel labor, they exacted with rigor, in order to afflict the children of Israel, but the more they afflicted them, the more they increased and grew, and the Egyptians were grieved because of the children of Israel.",
        "66:1": "At that time died Hadad the son of Bedad king of Edom, and Samlah from Mesrekah, from the country of the children of the east, reigned in his place.",
        "66:2": "In the thirteenth year of the reign of Pharaoh king of Egypt, which was the hundred and twenty-fifth year of the Israelites going down into Egypt, Samlah had reigned over Edom eighteen years.",
        "66:3": "And when he reigned, he drew forth his hosts to go and fight against Zepho the son of Eliphaz and the children of Chittim, because they had made war against Angeas king of Africa, and they destroyed his whole army.",
        "66:4": "But he did not engage with him, for the children of Esau prevented him, saying, He was their brother, so Samlah listened to the voice of the children of Esau, and turned back with all his forces to the land of Edom, and did not proceed to fight against Zepho the son of Eliphaz.",
        "66:5": "And Pharaoh king of Egypt heard this thing, saying, Samlah king of Edom has resolved to fight the children of Chittim, and afterward he will come to fight against Egypt.",
        "66:6": "And when the Egyptians heard this matter, they increased the labor upon the children of Israel, lest the Israelites should do unto them as they did unto them in their war with the children of Esau in the days of Hadad.",
        "66:7": "So the Egyptians said unto the children of Israel, Hasten and do your work, and finish your task, and strengthen the land, lest the children of Esau your brethren should come to fight against us, for on your account will they come against us.",
        "66:8": "And the children of Israel did the work of the men of Egypt day by day, and the Egyptians afflicted the children of Israel in order to lessen them in the land.",
        "66:9": "But as the Egyptians increased the labor upon the children of Israel, so did the children of Israel increase and multiply, and all Egypt was filled with the children of Israel.",
        "66:10": "And in the hundred and twenty-fifth year of Israel's going down into Egypt, all the Egyptians saw that their counsel did not succeed against Israel, but that they increased and grew, and the land of Egypt and the land of Goshen were filled with the children of Israel.",
        "66:11": "So all the elders of Egypt and its wise men came before the king and bowed down to him and sat before him.",
        "66:12": "And all the elders of Egypt and the wise men thereof said unto the king, May the king live forever; thou didst counsel us the counsel against the children of Israel, and we did unto them according to the word of the king.",
        "66:13": "But in proportion to the increase of the labor so do they increase and grow in the land, and behold the whole country is filled with them.",
        "66:14": "Now therefore our lord and king, the eyes of all Egypt are upon thee to give them advice with thy wisdom, by which they may prevail over Israel to destroy them, or to diminish them from the land; and the king answered them saying, Give you counsel in this matter that we may know what to do unto them.",
        "66:15": "And an officer, one of the king's counsellors, whose name was Job, from Mesopotamia, in the land of Uz, answered the king, saying,",
        "66:16": "If it please the king, let him hear the counsel of his servant; and the king said unto him, Speak.",
        "66:17": "And Job spoke before the king, the princes, and before all the elders of Egypt, saying,",
        "66:18": "Behold the counsel of the king which he advised formerly respecting the labor of the children of Israel is very good, and you must not remove from them that labor forever.",
        "66:19": "But this is the advice counselled by which you may lessen them, if it seems good to the king to afflict them.",
        "66:20": "Behold we have feared war for a long time, and we said, When Israel becomes fruitful in the land, they will drive us from the land if a war should take place.",
        "66:21": "If it please the king, let a royal decree go forth, and let it be written in the laws of Egypt which shall not be revoked, that every male child born to the Israelites, his blood shall be spilled upon the ground.",
        "66:22": "And by your doing this, when all the male children of Israel shall have died, the evil of their wars will cease; let the king do so and send for all the Hebrew midwives and order them in this matter to execute it; so the thing pleased the king and the princes, and the king did according to the word of Job.",
        "66:23": "And the king sent for the Hebrew midwives to be called, of which the name of one was Shephrah, and the name of the other Puah.",
        "66:24": "And the midwives came before the king, and stood in his presence.",
        "66:25": "And the king said unto them, When you do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools, if it be a son, then you shall kill him, but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.",
        "66:26": "But if you will not do this thing, then will I burn you up and all your houses with fire.",
        "66:27": "But the midwives feared God and did not hearken to the king of Egypt nor to his words, and when the Hebrew women brought forth to the midwife son or daughter, then did the midwife do all that was necessary to the child and let it live; thus did the midwives all the days.",
        "66:28": "And this thing was told to the king, and he sent and called for the midwives and he said to them, Why have you done this thing and have saved the children alive?",
        "66:29": "And the midwives answered and spoke together before the king, saying,",
        "66:30": "Let not the king think that the Hebrew women are as the Egyptian women, for all the children of Israel are hale, and before the midwife comes to them they are delivered, and as for us thy handmaids, for many days no Hebrew woman has brought forth upon us, for all the Hebrew women are their own midwives, because they are hale.",
        "66:31": "And Pharaoh heard their words and believed them in this matter, and the midwives went away from the king, and God dealt well with them, and the people multiplied and waxed exceedingly.",
        "67:1": "There was a man in the land of Egypt of the seed of Levi, whose name was Amram, the son of Kehath, the son of Levi, the son of Israel.",
        "67:2": "And this man went and took a wife, namely Jochebed the daughter of Levi his father's sister, and she was one hundred and twenty-six years old, and he came unto her.",
        "67:3": "And the woman conceived and bare a daughter, and she called her name Miriam, because in those days the Egyptians had embittered the lives of the children of Israel.",
        "67:4": "And she conceived again and bare a son and she called his name Aaron, for in the days of her conception, Pharaoh began to spill the blood of the male children of Israel.",
        "67:5": "In those days died Zepho the son of Eliphaz, son of Esau, king of Chittim, and Janeas reigned in his stead.",
        "67:6": "And the time that Zepho reigned over the children of Chittim was fifty years, and he died and was buried in the city of Nabna in the land of Chittim.",
        "67:7": "And Janeas, one of the mighty men of the children of Chittim, reigned after him and he reigned fifty years.",
        "67:8": "And it was after the death of the king of Chittim that Balaam the son of Beor fled from the land of Chittim, and he went and came to Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt.",
        "67:9": "And Pharaoh received him with great honor, for he had heard of his wisdom, and he gave him presents and made him for a counsellor, and aggrandized him.",
        "67:10": "And Balaam dwelt in Egypt, in honor with all the nobles of the king, and the nobles exalted him, because they all coveted to learn his wisdom.",
        "67:11": "And in the hundred and thirtieth year of Israel's going down to Egypt, Pharaoh dreamed that he was sitting upon his kingly throne, and lifted up his eyes and saw an old man standing before him, and there were scales in the hands of the old man, such scales as are used by merchants.",
        "67:12": "And the old man took the scales and hung them before Pharaoh.",
        "67:13": "And the old man took all the elders of Egypt and all its nobles and great men, and he tied them together and put them in one scale.",
        "67:14": "And he took a milk kid and put it into the other scale, and the kid preponderated over all.",
        "67:15": "And Pharaoh was astonished at this dreadful vision, why the kid should preponderate over all, and Pharaoh awoke and behold it was a dream.",
        "67:16": "And Pharaoh rose up early in the morning and called all his servants and related to them the dream, and the men were greatly afraid.",
        "67:17": "And the king said to all his wise men, Interpret I pray you the dream which I dreamed, that I may know it.",
        "67:18": "And Balaam the son of Beor answered the king and said unto him, This means nothing else but a great evil that will spring up against Egypt in the latter days.",
        "67:19": "For a son will be born to Israel who will destroy all Egypt and its inhabitants, and bring forth the Israelites from Egypt with a mighty hand.",
        "67:20": "Now therefore, O king, take counsel upon this matter, that you may destroy the hope of the children of Israel and their expectation, before this evil arise against Egypt.",
        "67:21": "And the king said unto Balaam, And what shall we do unto Israel? surely after a certain manner did we at first counsel against them and could not prevail over them.",
        "67:22": "Now therefore give you also advice against them by which we may prevail over them.",
        "67:23": "And Balaam answered the king, saying, Send now and call thy two counsellors, and we will see what their advice is upon this matter and afterward thy servant will speak.",
        "67:24": "And the king sent and called his two counsellors Reuel the Midianite and Job the Uzite, and they came and sat before the king.",
        "67:25": "And the king said to them, Behold you have both heard the dream which I have dreamed, and the interpretation thereof; now therefore give counsel and know and see what is to be done to the children of Israel, whereby we may prevail over them, before their evil shall spring up against us.",
        "67:26": "And Reuel the Midianite answered the king and said, May the king live, may the king live forever.",
        "67:27": "If it seem good to the king, let him desist from the Hebrews and leave them, and let him not stretch forth his hand against them.",
        "67:28": "For these are they whom the Lord chose in days of old, and took as the lot of his inheritance from amongst all the nations of the earth and the kings of the earth; and who is there that stretched his hand against them with impunity, of whom their God was not avenged?",
        "67:29": "Surely thou knowest that when Abraham went down to Egypt, Pharaoh, the former king of Egypt, saw Sarah his wife, and took her for a wife, because Abraham said, She is my sister, for he was afraid, lest the men of Egypt should slay him on account of his wife.",
        "67:30": "And when the king of Egypt had taken Sarah then God smote him and his household with heavy plagues, until he restored unto Abraham his wife Sarah, then was he healed.",
        "67:31": "And Abimelech the Gerarite, king of the Philistines, God punished on account of Sarah wife of Abraham, in stopping up every womb from man to beast.",
        "67:32": "When their God came to Abimelech in the dream of night and terrified him in order that he might restore to Abraham Sarah whom he had taken, and afterward all the people of Gerar were punished on account of Sarah, and Abraham prayed to his God for them, and he was entreated of him, and he healed them.",
        "67:33": "And Abimelech feared all this evil that came upon him and his people, and he returned to Abraham his wife Sarah, and gave him with her many gifts.",
        "67:34": "He did so also to Isaac when he had driven him from Gerar, and God had done wonderful things to him, that all the water courses of Gerar were dried up, and their productive trees did not bring forth.",
        "67:35": "Until Abimelech of Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Pichol the captain of his host, went to him and they bent and bowed down before him to the ground.",
        "67:36": "And they requested of him to supplicate for them, and he prayed to the Lord for them, and the Lord was entreated of him and he healed them.",
        "67:37": "Jacob also, the plain man, was delivered through his integrity from the hand of his brother Esau, and the hand of Laban the Syrian his mother's brother, who had sought his life; likewise from the hand of all the kings of Canaan who had come together against him and his children to destroy them, and the Lord delivered them out of their hands, that they turned upon them and smote them, for who had ever stretched forth his hand against them with impunity?",
        "67:38": "Surely Pharaoh the former, thy father's father, raised Joseph the son of Jacob above all the princes of the land of Egypt, when he saw his wisdom, for through his wisdom he rescued all the inhabitants of the land from the famine.",
        "67:39": "After which he ordered Jacob and his children to come down to Egypt, in order that through their virtue, the land of Egypt and the land of Goshen might be delivered from the famine.",
        "67:40": "Now therefore if it seem good in thine eyes, cease from destroying the children of Israel, but if it be not thy will that they shall dwell in Egypt, send them forth from here, that they may go to the land of Canaan, the land where their ancestors sojourned.",
        "67:41": "And when Pharaoh heard the words of Jethro he was very angry with him, so that he rose with shame from the king's presence, and went to Midian, his land, and took Joseph's stick with him.",
        "67:42": "And the king said to Job the Uzite, What sayest thou Job, and what is thy advice respecting the Hebrews?",
        "67:43": "So Job said to the king, Behold all the inhabitants of the land are in thy power, let the king do as it seems good in his eyes.",
        "67:44": "And the king said unto Balaam, What dost thou say, Balaam, speak thy word that we may hear it.",
        "67:45": "And Balaam said to the king, Of all that the king has counselled against the Hebrews will they be delivered, and the king will not be able to prevail over them with any counsel.",
        "67:46": "For if thou thinkest to lessen them by the flaming fire, thou canst not prevail over them, for surely their God delivered Abraham their father from Ur of the Chaldeans; and if thou thinkest to destroy them with a sword, surely Isaac their father was delivered from it, and a ram was placed in his stead.",
        "67:47": "And if with hard and rigorous labor thou thinkest to lessen them, thou wilt not prevail even in this, for their father Jacob served Laban in all manner of hard work, and prospered.",
        "67:48": "Now therefore, O King, hear my words, for this is the counsel which is counselled against them, by which thou wilt prevail over them, and from which thou shouldst not depart.",
        "67:49": "If it please the king let him order all their children which shall be born from this day forward, to be thrown into the water, for by this canst thou wipe away their name, for none of them, nor of their fathers, were tried in this manner.",
        "67:50": "And the king heard the words of Balaam, and the thing pleased the king and the princes, and the king did according to the word of Balaam.",
        "67:51": "And the king ordered a proclamation to be issued and a law to be made throughout the land of Egypt, saying, Every male child born to the Hebrews from this day forward shall be thrown into the water.",
        "67:52": "And Pharaoh called unto all his servants, saying, Go now and seek throughout the land of Goshen where the children of Israel are, and see that every son born to the Hebrews shall be cast into the river, but every daughter you shall let live.",
        "67:53": "And when the children of Israel heard this thing which Pharaoh had commanded, to cast their male children into the river, some of the people separated from their wives and others adhered to them.",
        "67:54": "And from that day forward, when the time of delivery arrived to those women of Israel who had remained with their husbands, they went to the field to bring forth there, and they brought forth in the field, and left their children upon the field and returned home.",
        "67:55": "And the Lord who had sworn to their ancestors to multiply them, sent one of his ministering angels which are in heaven to wash each child in water, to anoint and swathe it and to put into its hands two smooth stones from one of which it sucked milk and from the other honey, and he caused its hair to grow to its knees, by which it might cover itself; to comfort it and to cleave to it, through his compassion for it.",
        "67:56": "And when God had compassion over them and had desired to multiply them upon the face of the land, he ordered his earth to receive them to be preserved therein till the time of their growing up, after which the earth opened its mouth and vomited them forth and they sprouted forth from the city like the herb of the earth, and the grass of the forest, and they returned each to his family and to his father's house, and they remained with them.",
        "67:57": "And the babes of the children of Israel were upon the earth like the herb of the field, through God's grace to them.",
        "67:58": "And when all the Egyptians saw this thing, they went forth, each to his field with his yoke of oxen and his ploughshare, and they ploughed it up as one ploughs the earth at seed time.",
        "67:59": "And when they ploughed they were unable to hurt the infants of the children of Israel, so the people increased and waxed exceedingly.",
        "67:60": "And Pharaoh ordered his officers daily to go to Goshen to seek for the babes of the children of Israel.",
        "67:61": "And when they had sought and found one, they took it from its mother's bosom by force, and threw it into the river, but the female child they left with its mother; thus did the Egyptians do to the Israelites all the days.",
        "68:1": "And it was at that time the spirit of God was upon Miriam the daughter of Amram the sister of Aaron, and she went forth and prophesied about the house, saying, Behold a son will be born unto us from my father and mother this time, and he will save Israel from the hands of Egypt.",
        "68:2": "And when Amram heard the words of his daughter, he went and took his wife back to the house, after he had driven her away at the time when Pharaoh ordered every male child of the house of Jacob to be thrown into the water.",
        "68:3": "So Amram took Jochebed his wife, three years after he had driven her away, and he came to her and she conceived.",
        "68:4": "And at the end of seven months from her conception she brought forth a son, and the whole house was filled with great light as of the light of the sun and moon at the time of their shining.",
        "68:5": "And when the woman saw the child that it was good and pleasing to the sight, she hid it for three months in an inner room.",
        "68:6": "In those days the Egyptians conspired to destroy all the Hebrews there.",
        "68:7": "And the Egyptian women went to Goshen where the children of Israel were, and they carried their young ones upon their shoulders, their babes who could not yet speak.",
        "68:8": "And in those days, when the women of the children of Israel brought forth, each woman had hidden her son from before the Egyptians, that the Egyptians might not know of their bringing forth, and might not destroy them from the land.",
        "68:9": "And the Egyptian women came to Goshen and their children who could not speak were upon their shoulders, and when an Egyptian woman came into the house of a Hebrew woman her babe began to cry.",
        "68:10": "And when it cried the child that was in the inner room answered it, so the Egyptian women went and told it at the house of Pharaoh.",
        "68:11": "And Pharaoh sent his officers to take the children and slay them; thus did the Egyptians to the Hebrew women all the days.",
        "68:12": "And it was at that time, about three months from Jochebed's concealment of her son, that the thing was known in Pharaoh's house.",
        "68:13": "And the woman hastened to take away her son before the officers came, and she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein, and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.",
        "68:14": "And his sister Miriam stood afar off to know what would be done to him, and what would become of her words.",
        "68:15": "And God sent forth at that time a terrible heat in the land of Egypt, which burned up the flesh of man like the sun in his circuit, and it greatly oppressed the Egyptians.",
        "68:16": "And all the Egyptians went down to bathe in the river, on account of the consuming heat which burned up their flesh.",
        "68:17": "And Bathia, the daughter of Pharaoh, went also to bathe in the river, owing to the consuming heat, and her maidens walked at the river side, and all the women of Egypt as well.",
        "68:18": "And Bathia lifted up her eyes to the river, and she saw the ark upon the water, and sent her maid to fetch it.",
        "68:19": "And she opened it and saw the child, and behold the babe wept, and she had compassion on him, and she said, This is one of the Hebrew children.",
        "68:20": "And all the women of Egypt walking on the river side desired to give him suck, but he would not suck, for this thing was from the Lord, in order to restore him to his mother's breast.",
        "68:21": "And Miriam his sister was at that time amongst the Egyptian women at the river side, and she saw this thing and she said to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and fetch a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?",
        "68:22": "And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go, and the young woman went and called the child's mother.",
        "68:23": "And Pharaoh's daughter said to Jochebed, Take this child away and suckle it for me, and I will pay thee thy wages, two bits of silver daily; and the woman took the child and nursed it.",
        "68:24": "And at the end of two years, when the child grew up, she brought him to the daughter of Pharaoh, and he was unto her as a son, and she called his name Moses, for she said, Because I drew him out of the water.",
        "68:25": "And Amram his father called his name Chabar, for he said, It was for him that he associated with his wife whom he had turned away.",
        "68:26": "And Jochebed his mother called his name Jekuthiel, Because, she said, I have hoped for him to the Almighty, and God restored him unto me.",
        "68:27": "And Miriam his sister called him Jered, for she descended after him to the river to know what his end would be.",
        "68:28": "And Aaron his brother called his name Abi Zanuch, saying, My father left my mother and returned to her on his account.",
        "68:29": "And Kehath the father of Amram called his name Abigdor, because on his account did God repair the breach of the house of Jacob, that they could no longer throw their male children into the water.",
        "68:30": "And their nurse called him Abi Socho, saying, In his tabernacle was he hidden for three months, on account of the children of Ham.",
        "68:31": "And all Israel called his name Shemaiah, son of Nethanel, for they said, In his days has God heard their cries and rescued them from their oppressors.",
        "68:32": "And Moses was in Pharaoh's house, and was unto Bathia, Pharaoh's daughter, as a son, and Moses grew up amongst the king's children.",
        "69:1": "And the king of Edom died in those days, in the eighteenth year of his reign, and was buried in his temple which he had built for himself as his royal residence in the land of Edom.",
        "69:2": "And the children of Esau sent to Pethor, which is upon the river, and they fetched from there a young man of beautiful eyes and comely aspect, whose name was Saul, and they made him king over them in the place of Samlah.",
        "69:3": "And Saul reigned over all the children of Esau in the land of Edom for forty years.",
        "69:4": "And when Pharaoh king of Egypt saw that the counsel which Balaam had advised respecting the children of Israel did not succeed, but that still they were fruitful, multiplied and increased throughout the land of Egypt,",
        "69:5": "Then Pharaoh commanded in those days that a proclamation should be issued throughout Egypt to the children of Israel, saying, No man shall diminish any thing of his daily labor.",
        "69:6": "And the man who shall be found deficient in his labor which he performs daily, whether in mortar or in bricks, then his youngest son shall be put in their place.",
        "69:7": "And the labor of Egypt strengthened upon the children of Israel in those days, and behold if one brick was deficient in any man's daily labor, the Egyptians took his youngest boy by force from his mother, and put him into the building in the place of the brick which his father had left wanting.",
        "69:8": "And the men of Egypt did so to all the children of Israel day by day, all the days for a long period.",
        "69:9": "But the tribe of Levi did not at that time work with the Israelites their brethren, from the beginning, for the children of Levi knew the cunning of the Egyptians which they exercised at first toward the Israelites.",
        "70:1": "And in the third year from the birth of Moses, Pharaoh was sitting at a banquet, when Alparanith the queen was sitting at his right and Bathia at his left, and the lad Moses was lying upon her bosom, and Balaam the son of Beor with his two sons, and all the princes of the kingdom were sitting at table in the king's presence.",
        "70:2": "And the lad stretched forth his hand upon the king's head, and took the crown from the king's head and placed it on his own head.",
        "70:3": "And when the king and princes saw the work which the boy had done, the king and princes were terrified, and one man to his neighbor expressed astonishment.",
        "70:4": "And the king said unto the princes who were before him at table, What speak you and what say you, O ye princes, in this matter, and what is to be the judgment against the boy on account of this act?",
        "70:5": "And Balaam the son of Beor the magician answered before the king and princes, and he said, Remember now, O my lord and king, the dream which thou didst dream many days since, and that which thy servant interpreted unto thee.",
        "70:6": "Now therefore this is a child from the Hebrew children, in whom is the spirit of God, and let not my lord the king imagine that this youngster did this thing without knowledge.",
        "70:7": "For he is a Hebrew boy, and wisdom and understanding are with him, although he is yet a child, and with wisdom has he done this and chosen unto himself the kingdom of Egypt.",
        "70:8": "For this is the manner of all the Hebrews to deceive kings and their nobles, to do all these things cunningly, in order to make the kings of the earth and their men tremble.",
        "70:9": "Surely thou knowest that Abraham their father acted thus, who deceived the army of Nimrod king of Babel, and Abimelech king of Gerar, and that he possessed himself of the land of the children of Heth and all the kingdoms of Canaan.",
        "70:10": "And that he descended into Egypt and said of Sarah his wife, she is my sister, in order to mislead Egypt and her king.",
        "70:11": "His son Isaac also did so when he went to Gerar and dwelt there, and his strength prevailed over the army of Abimelech king of the Philistines.",
        "70:12": "He also thought of making the kingdom of the Philistines stumble, in saying that Rebecca his wife was his sister.",
        "70:13": "Jacob also dealt treacherously with his brother, and took from his hand his birthright and his blessing.",
        "70:14": "He went then to Padan-aram to the house of Laban his mother's brother, and cunningly obtained from him his daughter, his cattle, and all belonging to him, and fled away and returned to the land of Canaan to his father.",
        "70:15": "His sons sold their brother Joseph, who went down into Egypt and became a slave, and was placed in the prison house for twelve years.",
        "70:16": "Until the former Pharaoh dreamed dreams, and withdrew him from the prison house, and magnified him above all the princes in Egypt on account of his interpreting his dreams to him.",
        "70:17": "And when God caused a famine throughout the land he sent for and brought his father and all his brothers, and the whole of his father's household, and supported them without price or reward, and bought the Egyptians for slaves.",
        "70:18": "Now therefore my lord king behold this child has risen up in their stead in Egypt, to do according to their deeds and to trifle with every king, prince and judge.",
        "70:19": "If it please the king, let us now spill his blood upon the ground, lest he grow up and take away the government from thy hand, and the hope of Egypt perish after he shall have reigned.",
        "70:20": "And Balaam said to the king, Let us moreover call for all the judges of Egypt and the wise men thereof, and let us know if the judgment of death is due to this boy as thou didst say, and then we will slay him.",
        "70:21": "And Pharaoh sent and called for all the wise men of Egypt and they came before the king, and an angel of the Lord came amongst them, and he was like one of the wise men of Egypt.",
        "70:22": "And the king said to the wise men, Surely you have heard what this Hebrew boy who is in the house has done, and thus has Balaam judged in the matter.",
        "70:23": "Now judge you also and see what is due to the boy for the act he has committed.",
        "70:24": "And the angel, who seemed like one of the wise men of Pharaoh, answered and said as follows, before all the wise men of Egypt and before the king and the princes:",
        "70:25": "If it please the king let the king send for men who shall bring before him an onyx stone and a coal of fire, and place them before the child, and if the child shall stretch forth his hand and take the onyx stone, then shall we know that with wisdom has the youth done all that he has done, and we must slay him.",
        "70:26": "But if he stretch forth his hand upon the coal, then shall we know that it was not with knowledge that he did this thing, and he shall live.",
        "70:27": "And the thing seemed good in the eyes of the king and the princes, so the king did according to the word of the angel of the Lord.",
        "70:28": "And the king ordered the onyx stone and coal to be brought and placed before Moses.",
        "70:29": "And they placed the boy before them, and the lad endeavored to stretch forth his hand to the onyx stone, but the angel of the Lord took his hand and placed it upon the coal, and the coal became extinguished in his hand, and he lifted it up and put it into his mouth, and burned part of his lips and part of his tongue, and he became heavy in mouth and tongue.",
        "70:30": "And when the king and princes saw this, they knew that Moses had not acted with wisdom in taking off the crown from the king's head.",
        "70:31": "So the king and princes refrained from slaying the child, so Moses remained in Pharaoh's house, growing up, and the Lord was with him.",
        "70:32": "And whilst the boy was in the king's house, he was robed in purple and he grew amongst the children of the king.",
        "70:33": "And when Moses grew up in the king's house, Bathia the daughter of Pharaoh considered him as a son, and all the household of Pharaoh honored him, and all the men of Egypt were afraid of him.",
        "70:34": "And he daily went forth and came into the land of Goshen, where his brethren the children of Israel were, and Moses saw them daily in shortness of breath and hard labor.",
        "70:35": "And Moses asked them, saying, Wherefore is this labor meted out unto you day by day?",
        "70:36": "And they told him all that had befallen them, and all the injunctions which Pharaoh had put upon them before his birth.",
        "70:37": "And they told him all the counsels which Balaam the son of Beor had counselled against them, and what he had also counselled against him in order to slay him when he had taken the king's crown from off his head.",
        "70:38": "And when Moses heard these things his anger was kindled against Balaam, and he sought to kill him, and he was in ambush for him day by day.",
        "70:39": "And Balaam was afraid of Moses, and he and his two sons rose up and went forth from Egypt, and they fled and delivered their souls and betook themselves to the land of Cush to Kikianus, king of Cush.",
        "70:40": "And Moses was in the king's house going out and coming in, the Lord gave him favor in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants, and in the eyes of all the people of Egypt, and they loved Moses exceedingly.",
        "70:41": "And the day arrived when Moses went to Goshen to see his brethren, that he saw the children of Israel in their burdens and hard labor, and Moses was grieved on their account.",
        "70:42": "And Moses returned to Egypt and came to the house of Pharaoh, and came before the king, and Moses bowed down before the king.",
        "70:43": "And Moses said unto Pharaoh, I pray thee my lord, I have come to seek a small request from thee, turn not away my face empty; and Pharaoh said unto him, Speak.",
        "70:44": "And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Let there be given unto thy servants the children of Israel who are in Goshen, one day to rest therein from their labor.",
        "70:45": "And the king answered Moses and said, Behold I have lifted up thy face in this thing to grant thy request.",
        "70:46": "And Pharaoh ordered a proclamation to be issued throughout Egypt and Goshen, saying,",
        "70:47": "To you, all the children of Israel, thus says the king, for six days you shall do your work and labor, but on the seventh day you shall rest, and shall not preform any work, thus shall you do all the days, as the king and Moses the son of Bathia have commanded.",
        "70:48": "And Moses rejoiced at this thing which the king had granted to him, and all the children of Israel did as Moses ordered them.",
        "70:49": "For this thing was from the Lord to the children of Israel, for the Lord had begun to remember the children of Israel to save them for the sake of their fathers.",
        "70:50": "And the Lord was with Moses and his fame went throughout Egypt.",
        "70:51": "And Moses became great in the eyes of all the Egyptians, and in the eyes of all the children of Israel, seeking good for his people Israel and speaking words of peace regarding them to the king.",
        "71:1": "And when Moses was eighteen years old, he desired to see his father and mother and he went to them to Goshen, and when Moses had come near Goshen, he came to the place where the children of Israel were engaged in work, and he observed their burdens, and he saw an Egyptian smiting one of his Hebrew brethren.",
        "71:2": "And when the man who was beaten saw Moses he ran to him for help, for the man Moses was greatly respected in the house of Pharaoh, and he said to him, My lord attend to me, this Egyptian came to my house in the night, bound me, and came to my wife in my presence, and now he seeks to take my life away.",
        "71:3": "And when Moses heard this wicked thing, his anger was kindled against the Egyptian, and he turned this way and the other, and when he saw there was no man there he smote the Egyptian and hid him in the sand, and delivered the Hebrew from the hand of him that smote him.",
        "71:4": "And the Hebrew went to his house, and Moses returned to his home, and went forth and came back to the king's house.",
        "71:5": "And when the man had returned home, he thought of repudiating his wife, for it was not right in the house of Jacob, for any man to come to his wife after she had been defiled.",
        "71:6": "And the woman went and told her brothers, and the woman's brothers sought to slay him, and he fled to his house and escaped.",
        "71:7": "And on the second day Moses went forth to his brethren, and saw, and behold two men were quarreling, and he said to the wicked one, Why dost thou smite thy neighbor?",
        "71:8": "And he answered him and said to him, Who has set thee for a prince and judge over us? dost thou think to slay me as thou didst slay the Egyptian? and Moses was afraid and he said, Surely the thing is known?",
        "71:9": "And Pharaoh heard of this affair, and he ordered Moses to be slain, so God sent his angel, and he appeared unto Pharaoh in the likeness of a captain of the guard.",
        "71:10": "And the angel of the Lord took the sword from the hand of the captain of the guard, and took his head off with it, for the likeness of the captain of the guard was turned into the likeness of Moses.",
        "71:11": "And the angel of the Lord took hold of the right hand of Moses, and brought him forth from Egypt, and placed him from without the borders of Egypt, a distance of forty days' journey.",
        "71:12": "And Aaron his brother alone remained in the land of Egypt, and he prophesied to the children of Israel, saying,",
        "71:13": "Thus says the Lord God of your ancestors, Throw away, each man, the abominations of his eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt.",
        "71:14": "And the children of Israel rebelled and would not hearken to Aaron at that time.",
        "71:15": "And the Lord thought to destroy them, were it not that the Lord remembered the covenant which he had made with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.",
        "71:16": "In those days the hand of Pharaoh continued to be severe against the children of Israel, and he crushed and oppressed them until the time when God sent forth his word and took notice of them.",
        "72:1": "And it was in those days that there was a great war between the children of Cush and the children of the east and Aram, and they rebelled against the king of Cush in whose hands they were.",
        "72:2": "So Kikianus king of Cush went forth with all the children of Cush, a people numerous as the sand, and he went to fight against Aram and the children of the east, to bring them under subjection.",
        "72:3": "And when Kikianus went out, he left Balaam the magician, with his two sons, to guard the city, and the lowest sort of the people of the land.",
        "72:4": "So Kikianus went forth to Aram and the children of the east, and he fought against them and smote them, and they all fell down wounded before Kikianus and his people.",
        "72:5": "And he took many of them captives and he brought them under subjection as at first, and he encamped upon their land to take tribute from them as usual.",
        "72:6": "And Balaam the son of Beor, when the king of Cush had left him to guard the city and the poor of the city, he rose up and advised with the people of the land to rebel against king Kikianus, not to let him enter the city when he should come home.",
        "72:7": "And the people of the land hearkened to him, and they swore to him and made him king over them, and his two sons for captains of the army.",
        "72:8": "So they rose up and raised the walls of the city at the two corners, and they built an exceeding strong building.",
        "72:9": "And at the third corner they dug ditches without number, between the city and the river which surrounded the whole land of Cush, and they made the waters of the river burst forth there.",
        "72:10": "At the fourth corner they collected numerous serpents by their incantations and enchantments, and they fortified the city and dwelt therein, and no one went out or in before them.",
        "72:11": "And Kikianus fought against Aram and the children of the east and he subdued them as before, and they gave him their usual tribute, and he went and returned to his land.",
        "72:12": "And when Kikianus the king of Cush approached his city and all the captains of the forces with him, they lifted up their eyes and saw that the walls of the city were built up and greatly elevated, so the men were astonished at this.",
        "72:13": "And they said one to the other, It is because they saw that we were delayed, in battle, and were greatly afraid of us, therefore have they done this thing and raised the city walls and fortified them so that the kings of Canaan might not come in battle against them.",
        "72:14": "So the king and the troops approached the city door and they looked up and behold, all the gates of the city were closed, and they called out to the sentinels, saying, Open unto us, that we may enter the city.",
        "72:15": "But the sentinels refused to open to them by the order of Balaam the magician, their king, they suffered them not to enter their city.",
        "72:16": "So they raised a battle with them opposite the city gate, and one hundred and thirty men of the army at Kikianus fell on that day.",
        "72:17": "And on the next day they continued to fight and they fought at the side of the river; they endeavored to pass but were not able, so some of them sank in the pits and died.",
        "72:18": "So the king ordered them to cut down trees to make rafts, upon which they might pass to them, and they did so.",
        "72:19": "And when they came to the place of the ditches, the waters revolved by mills, and two hundred men upon ten rafts were drowned.",
        "72:20": "And on the third day they came to fight at the side where the serpents were, but they could not approach there, for the serpents slew of them one hundred and seventy men, and they ceased fighting against Cush, and they besieged Cush for nine years, no person came out or in.",
        "72:21": "At that time that the war and the siege were against Cush, Moses fled from Egypt from Pharaoh who sought to kill him for having slain the Egyptian.",
        "72:22": "And Moses was eighteen years old when he fled from Egypt from the presence of Pharaoh, and he fled and escaped to the camp of Kikianus, which at that time was besieging Cush.",
        "72:23": "And Moses was nine years in the camp of Kikianus king of Cush, all the time that they were besieging Cush, and Moses went out and came in with them.",
        "72:24": "And the king and princes and all the fighting men loved Moses, for he was great and worthy, his stature was like a noble lion, his face was like the sun, and his strength was like that of a lion, and he was counsellor to the king.",
        "72:25": "And at the end of nine years, Kikianus was seized with a mortal disease, and his illness prevailed over him, and he died on the seventh day.",
        "72:26": "So his servants embalmed him and carried him and buried him opposite the city gate to the north of the land of Egypt.",
        "72:27": "And they built over him an elegant strong and high building, and they placed great stones below.",
        "72:28": "And the king's scribes engraved upon those stones all the might of their king Kikianus, and all his battles which he had fought, behold they are written there at this day.",
        "72:29": "Now after the death of Kikianus king of Cush it grieved his men and troops greatly on account of the war.",
        "72:30": "So they said one to the other, Give us counsel what we are to do at this time, as we have resided in the wilderness nine years away from our homes.",
        "72:31": "If we say we will fight against the city many of us will fall wounded or killed, and if we remain here in the siege we shall also die.",
        "72:32": "For now all the kings of Aram and of the children of the east will hear that our king is dead, and they will attack us suddenly in a hostile manner, and they will fight against us and leave no remnant of us.",
        "72:33": "Now therefore let us go and make a king over us, and let us remain in the siege until the city is delivered up to us.",
        "72:34": "And they wished to choose on that day a man for king from the army of Kikianus, and they found no object of their choice like Moses to reign over them.",
        "72:35": "And they hastened and stripped off each man his garments and cast them upon the ground, and they made a great heap and placed Moses thereon.",
        "72:36": "And they rose up and blew with trumpets and called out before him, and said, May the king live, may the king live!",
        "72:37": "And all the people and nobles swore unto him to give him for a wife Adoniah the queen, the Cushite, wife of Kikianus, and they made Moses king over them on that day.",
        "72:38": "And all the people of Cush issued a proclamation on that day, saying, Every man must give something to Moses of what is in his possession.",
        "72:39": "And they spread out a sheet upon the heap, and every man cast into it something of what he had, one a gold earring and the other a coin.",
        "72:40": "Also of onyx stones, bdellium, pearls and marble did the children of Cush cast unto Moses upon the heap, also silver and gold in great abundance.",
        "72:41": "And Moses took all the silver and gold, all the vessels, and the bdellium and onyx stones, which all the children of Cush had given to him, and he placed them amongst his treasures.",
        "72:42": "And Moses reigned over the children of Cush on that day, in the place of Kikianus king of Cush.",
        "73:1": "In the fifty-fifth year of the reign of Pharaoh king of Egypt, that is in the hundred and fifty-seventh year of the Israelites going down into Egypt, reigned Moses in Cush.",
        "73:2": "Moses was twenty-seven years old when he began to reign over Cush, and forty years did he reign.",
        "73:3": "And the Lord granted Moses favor and grace in the eyes of all the children of Cush, and the children of Cush loved him exceedingly, so Moses was favored by the Lord and by men.",
        "73:4": "And in the seventh day of his reign, all the children of Cush assembled and came before Moses and bowed down to him to the ground.",
        "73:5": "And all the children spoke together in the presence of the king, saying, Give us counsel that we may see what is to be done to this city.",
        "73:6": "For it is now nine years that we have been besieging round about the city, and have not seen our children and our wives.",
        "73:7": "So the king answered them, saying, If you will hearken to my voice in all that I shall command you, then will the Lord give the city into our hands and we shall subdue it.",
        "73:8": "For if we fight with them as in the former battle which we had with them before the death of Kikianus, many of us will fall down wounded as before.",
        "73:9": "Now therefore behold here is counsel for you in this matter; if you will hearken to my voice, then will the city be delivered into our hands.",
        "73:10": "So all the forces answered the king, saying, All that our lord shall command that will we do.",
        "73:11": "And Moses said unto them, Pass through and proclaim a voice in the whole camp unto all the people, saying,",
        "73:12": "Thus says the king, Go into the forest and bring with you of the young ones of the stork, each man a young one in his hand.",
        "73:13": "And any person transgressing the word of the king, who shall not bring his young one, he shall die, and the king will take all belonging to him.",
        "73:14": "And when you shall bring them they shall be in your keeping, you shall rear them until they grow up, and you shall teach them to dart upon, as is the way of the young ones of the hawk.",
        "73:15": "So all the children of Cush heard the words of Moses, and they rose up and caused a proclamation to be issued throughout the camp, saying,",
        "73:16": "Unto you, all the children of Cush, the king's order is, that you go all together to the forest, and catch there the young storks each man his young one in his hand, and you shall bring them home.",
        "73:17": "And any person violating the order of the king shall die, and the king will take all that belongs to him.",
        "73:18": "And all the people did so, and they went out to the wood and they climbed the fir trees and caught, each man a young one in his hand, all the young of the storks, and they brought them into the desert and reared them by order of the king, and they taught them to dart upon, similar to the young hawks.",
        "73:19": "And after the young storks were reared, the king ordered them to be hungered for three days, and all the people did so.",
        "73:20": "And on the third day, the king said unto them, strengthen yourselves and become valiant men, and put on each man his armor and gird on his sword upon him, and ride each man his horse and take each his young stork in his hand.",
        "73:21": "And we will rise up and fight against the city at the place where the serpents are; and all the people did as the king had ordered.",
        "73:22": "And they took each man his young one in his hand, and they went away, and when they came to the place of the serpents the king said to them, Send forth each man his young stork upon the serpents.",
        "73:23": "And they sent forth each man his young stork at the king's order, and the young storks ran upon the serpents and they devoured them all and destroyed them out of that place.",
        "73:24": "And when the king and people had seen that all the serpents were destroyed in that place, all the people set up a great shout.",
        "73:25": "And they approached and fought against the city and took it and subdued it, and they entered the city.",
        "73:26": "And there died on that day one thousand and one hundred men of the people of the city, all that inhabited the city, but of the people besieging not one died.",
        "73:27": "So all the children of Cush went each to his home, to his wife and children and to all belonging to him.",
        "73:28": "And Balaam the magician, when he saw that the city was taken, he opened the gate and he and his two sons and eight brothers fled and returned to Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt.",
        "73:29": "They are the sorcerers and magicians who are mentioned in the book of the law, standing against Moses when the Lord brought the plagues upon Egypt.",
        "73:30": "So Moses took the city by his wisdom, and the children of Cush placed him on the throne instead of Kikianus king of Cush.",
        "73:31": "And they placed the royal crown upon his head, and they gave him for a wife Adoniah the Cushite queen, wife of Kikianus.",
        "73:32": "And Moses feared the Lord God of his fathers, so that he came not to her, nor did he turn his eyes to her.",
        "73:33": "For Moses remembered how Abraham had made his servant Eliezer swear, saying unto him, Thou shalt not take a woman from the daughters of Canaan for my son Isaac.",
        "73:34": "Also what Isaac did when Jacob had fled from his brother, when he commanded him, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan, nor make alliance with any of the children of Ham.",
        "73:35": "For the Lord our God gave Ham the son of Noah, and his children and all his seed, as slaves to the children of Shem and to the children of Japheth, and unto their seed after them for slaves, forever.",
        "73:36": "Therefore Moses turned not his heart nor his eyes to the wife of Kikianus all the days that he reigned over Cush.",
        "73:37": "And Moses feared the Lord his God all his life, and Moses walked before the Lord in truth, with all his heart and soul, he turned not from the right way all the days of his life; he declined not from the way either to the right or to the left, in which Abraham, Isaac and Jacob had walked.",
        "73:38": "And Moses strengthened himself in the kingdom of the children of Cush, and he guided the children of Cush with his usual wisdom, and Moses prospered in his kingdom.",
        "73:39": "And at that time Aram and the children of the east heard that Kikianus king of Cush had died, so Aram and the children of the east rebelled against Cush in those days.",
        "73:40": "And Moses gathered all the children of Cush, a people very mighty, about thirty thousand men, and he went forth to fight with Aram and the children of the east.",
        "73:41": "And they went at first to the children of the east, and when the children of the east heard their report, they went to meet them, and engaged in battle with them.",
        "73:42": "And the war was severe against the children of the east, so the Lord gave all the children of the east into the hand of Moses, and about three hundred men fell down slain.",
        "73:43": "And all the children of the east turned back and retreated, so Moses and the children of Cush followed them and subdued them, and put a tax upon them, as was their custom.",
        "73:44": "So Moses and all the people with him passed from there to the land of Aram for battle.",
        "73:45": "And the people of Aram also went to meet them, and they fought against them, and the Lord delivered them into the hand of Moses, and many of the men of Aram fell down wounded.",
        "73:46": "And Aram also were subdued by Moses and the people of Cush, and also gave their usual tax.",
        "73:47": "And Moses brought Aram and the children of the east under subjection to the children of Cush, and Moses and all the people who were with him, turned to the land of Cush.",
        "73:48": "And Moses strengthened himself in the kingdom of the children of Cush, and the Lord was with him, and all the children of Cush were afraid of him.",
        "74:1": "In the end of years died Saul king of Edom, and Baal Chanan the son of Achbor reigned in his place.",
        "74:2": "In the sixteenth year of the reign of Moses over Cush, Baal Chanan the son of Achbor reigned in the land of Edom over all the children of Edom for thirty-eight years.",
        "74:3": "In his days Moab rebelled against the power of Edom, having been under Edom since the days of Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote them and Midian, and brought Moab under subjection to Edom.",
        "74:4": "And when Baal Chanan the son of Achbor reigned over Edom, all the children of Moab withdrew their allegiance from Edom.",
        "74:5": "And Angeas king of Africa died in those days, and Azdrubal his son reigned in his stead.",
        "74:6": "And in those days died Janeas king of the children of Chittim, and they buried him in his temple which he had built for himself in the plain of Canopia for a residence, and Latinus reigned in his stead.",
        "74:7": "In the twenty-second year of the reign of Moses over the children of Cush, Latinus reigned over the children of Chittim forty-five years.",
        "74:8": "And he also built for himself a great and mighty tower, and he built therein an elegant temple for his residence, to conduct his government, as was the custom.",
        "74:9": "In the third year of his reign he caused a proclamation to be made to all his skilful men, who made many ships for him.",
        "74:10": "And Latinus assembled all his forces, and they came in ships, and went therein to fight with Azdrubal son of Angeas king of Africa, and they came to Africa and engaged in battle with Azdrubal and his army.",
        "74:11": "And Latinus prevailed over Azdrubal, and Latinus took from Azdrubal the aqueduct which his father had brought from the children of Chittim, when he took Janiah the daughter of Uzi for a wife, so Latinus overthrew the bridge of the aqueduct, and smote the whole army of Azdrubal a severe blow.",
        "74:12": "And the remaining strong men of Azdrubal strengthened themselves, and their hearts were filled with envy, and they courted death, and again engaged in battle with Latinus king of Chittim.",
        "74:13": "And the battle was severe upon all the men of Africa, and they all fell wounded before Latinus and his people, and Azdrubal the king also fell in that battle.",
        "74:14": "And the king Azdrubal had a very beautiful daughter, whose name was Ushpezena, and all the men of Africa embroidered her likeness on their garments, on account of her great beauty and comely appearance.",
        "74:15": "And the men of Latinus saw Ushpezena, the daughter of Azdrubal, and praised her unto Latinus their king.",
        "74:16": "And Latinus ordered her to be brought to him, and Latinus took Ushpezena for a wife, and he turned back on his way to Chittim.",
        "74:17": "And it was after the death of Azdrubal son of Angeas, when Latinus had turned back to his land from the battle, that all the inhabitants of Africa rose up and took Anibal the son of Angeas, the younger brother of Azdrubal, and made him king instead at his brother over the whole land at Africa.",
        "74:18": "And when he reigned, he resolved to go to Chittim to fight with the children of Chittim, to avenge the cause of Azdrubal his brother, and the cause of the inhabitants of Africa, and he did so.",
        "74:19": "And he made many ships, and he came therein with his whole army, and he went to Chittim.",
        "74:20": "So Anibal fought with the children of Chittim, and the children of Chittim fell wounded before Anibal and his army, and Anibal avenged his brother's cause.",
        "74:21": "And Anibal continued the war for eighteen years with the children of Chittim, and Anibal dwelt in the land of Chittim and encamped there for a long time.",
        "74:22": "And Anibal smote the children of Chittim very severely, and he slew their great men and princes, and of the rest of the people he smote about eighty thousand men.",
        "74:23": "And at the end of days and years, Anibal returned to his land of Africa, and he reigned securely in the place of Azdrubal his brother.",
        "75:1": "At that time, in the hundred and eightieth year of the Israelites going down into Egypt, there went forth from Egypt valiant men, thirty thousand on foot, from the children of Israel, who were all of the tribe of Joseph, of the children of Ephraim the son of Joseph.",
        "75:2": "For they said the period was completed which the Lord had appointed to the children of Israel in the times of old, which he had spoken to Abraham.",
        "75:3": "And these men girded themselves, and they put each man his sword at his side, and every man his armor upon him, and they trusted to their strength, and they went out together from Egypt with a mighty hand.",
        "75:4": "But they brought no provision for the road, only silver and gold, not even bread for that day did they bring in their hands, for they thought of getting their provision for pay from the Philistines, and if not they would take it by force.",
        "75:5": "And these men were very mighty and valiant men, one man could pursue a thousand and two could rout ten thousand, so they trusted to their strength and went together as they were.",
        "75:6": "And they directed their course toward the land of Gath, and they went down and found the shepherds of Gath feeding the cattle of the children of Gath.",
        "75:7": "And they said to the shepherds, Give us some of the sheep for pay, that we may eat, for we are hungry, for we have eaten no bread this day.",
        "75:8": "And the shepherds said, Are they our sheep or cattle that we should give them to you even for pay? so the children of Ephraim approached to take them by force.",
        "75:9": "And the shepherds of Gath shouted over them that their cry was heard at a distance, so all the children of Gath went out to them.",
        "75:10": "And when the children of Gath saw the evil doings of the children of Ephraim, they returned and assembled the men of Gath, and they put on each man his armor, and came forth to the children of Ephraim for battle.",
        "75:11": "And they engaged with them in the valley of Gath, and the battle was severe, and they smote from each other a great many on that day.",
        "75:12": "And on the second day the children of Gath sent to all the cities of the Philistines that they should come to their help, saying,",
        "75:13": "Come up unto us and help us, that we may smite the children of Ephraim who have come forth from Egypt to take our cattle, and to fight against us without cause.",
        "75:14": "Now the souls of the children of Ephraim were exhausted with hunger and thirst, for they had eaten no bread for three days. And forty thousand men went forth from the cities of the Philistines to the assistance of the men of Gath.",
        "75:15": "And these men were engaged in battle with the children of Ephraim, and the Lord delivered the children of Ephraim into the hands of the Philistines.",
        "75:16": "And they smote all the children of Ephraim, all who had gone forth from Egypt, none were remaining but ten men who had run away from the engagement.",
        "75:17": "For this evil was from the Lord against the children of Ephraim, for they transgressed the word of the Lord in going forth from Egypt, before the period had arrived which the Lord in the days of old had appointed to Israel.",
        "75:18": "And of the Philistines also there fell a great many, about twenty thousand men, and their brethren carried them and buried them in their cities.",
        "75:19": "And the slain of the children of Ephraim remained forsaken in the valley of Gath for many days and years, and were not brought to burial, and the valley was filled with men's bones.",
        "75:20": "And the men who had escaped from the battle came to Egypt, and told all the children of Israel all that had befallen them.",
        "75:21": "And their father Ephraim mourned over them for many days, and his brethren came to console him.",
        "75:22": "And he came unto his wife and she bare a son, and he called his name Beriah, for she was unfortunate in his house.",
        "76:1": "And Moses the son of Amram was still king in the land of Cush in those days, and he prospered in his kingdom, and he conducted the government of the children of Cush in justice, in righteousness, and integrity.",
        "76:2": "And all the children of Cush loved Moses all the days that he reigned over them, and all the inhabitants of the land of Cush were greatly afraid of him.",
        "76:3": "And in the fortieth year of the reign of Moses over Cush, Moses was sitting on the royal throne whilst Adoniah the queen was before him, and all the nobles were sitting around him.",
        "76:4": "And Adoniah the queen said before the king and the princes, What is this thing which you, the children of Cush, have done for this long time?",
        "76:5": "Surely you know that for forty years that this man has reigned over Cush he has not approached me, nor has he served the gods of the children of Cush.",
        "76:6": "Now therefore hear, O ye children of Cush, and let this man no more reign over you as he is not of our flesh.",
        "76:7": "Behold Menacrus my son is grown up, let him reign over you, for it is better for you to serve the son of your lord, than to serve a stranger, slave of the king of Egypt.",
        "76:8": "And all the people and nobles of the children of Cush heard the words which Adoniah the queen had spoken in their ears.",
        "76:9": "And all the people were preparing until the evening, and in the morning they rose up early and made Menacrus, son of Kikianus, king over them.",
        "76:10": "And all the children of Cush were afraid to stretch forth their hand against Moses, for the Lord was with Moses, and the children of Cush remembered the oath which they swore unto Moses, therefore they did no harm to him.",
        "76:11": "But the children of Cush gave many presents to Moses, and sent him from them with great honor.",
        "76:12": "So Moses went forth from the land of Cush, and went home and ceased to reign over Cush, and Moses was sixty-six years old when he went out of the land of Cush, for the thing was from the Lord, for the period had arrived which he had appointed in the days of old, to bring forth Israel from the affliction of the children of Ham.",
        "76:13": "So Moses went to Midian, for he was afraid to return to Egypt on account of Pharaoh, and he went and sat at a well of water in Midian.",
        "76:14": "And the seven daughters of Reuel the Midianite went out to feed their father's flock.",
        "76:15": "And they came to the well and drew water to water their father's flock.",
        "76:16": "So the shepherds of Midian came and drove them away, and Moses rose up and helped them and watered the flock.",
        "76:17": "And they came home to their father Reuel, and told him what Moses did for them.",
        "76:18": "And they said, An Egyptian man has delivered us from the hands of the shepherds, he drew up water for us and watered the flock.",
        "76:19": "And Reuel said to his daughters, And where is he? wherefore have you left the man?",
        "76:20": "And Reuel sent for him and fetched him and brought him home, and he ate bread with him.",
        "76:21": "And Moses related to Reuel that he had fled from Egypt and that he reigned forty years over Cush, and that they afterward had taken the government from him, and had sent him away in peace with honor and with presents.",
        "76:22": "And when Reuel had heard the words of Moses, Reuel said within himself, I will put this man into the prison house, whereby I shall conciliate the children of Cush, for he has fled from them.",
        "76:23": "And they took and put him into the prison house, and Moses was in prison ten years, and whilst Moses was in the prison house, Zipporah the daughter of Reuel took pity over him, and supported him with bread and water all the time.",
        "76:24": "And all the children of Israel were yet in the land of Egypt serving the Egyptians in all manner of hard work, and the hand of Egypt continued in severity over the children of Israel in those days.",
        "76:25": "At that time the Lord smote Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he afflicted with the plague of leprosy from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head; owing to the cruel treatment of the children of Israel was this plague at that time from the Lord upon Pharaoh king of Egypt.",
        "76:26": "For the Lord had hearkened to the prayer of his people the children of Israel, and their cry reached him on account of their hard work.",
        "76:27": "Still his anger did not turn from them, and the hand of Pharaoh was still stretched out against the children of Israel, and Pharaoh hardened his neck before the Lord, and he increased his yoke over the children of Israel, and embittered their lives with all manner of hard work.",
        "76:28": "And when the Lord had inflicted the plague upon Pharaoh king of Egypt, he asked his wise men and sorcerers to cure him.",
        "76:29": "And his wise men and sorcerers said unto him, That if the blood of little children were put into the wounds he would be healed.",
        "76:30": "And Pharaoh hearkened to them, and sent his ministers to Goshen to the children of Israel to take their little children.",
        "76:31": "And Pharaoh's ministers went and took the infants of the children of Israel from the bosoms of their mothers by force, and they brought them to Pharaoh daily, a child each day, and the physicians killed them and applied them to the plague; thus did they all the days.",
        "76:32": "And the number of the children which Pharaoh slew was three hundred and seventy-five.",
        "76:33": "But the Lord hearkened not to the physicians of the king of Egypt, and the plague went on increasing mightily.",
        "76:34": "And Pharaoh was ten years afflicted with that plague, still the heart of Pharaoh was more hardened against the children of Israel.",
        "76:35": "And at the end of ten years the Lord continued to afflict Pharaoh with destructive plagues.",
        "76:36": "And the Lord smote him with a bad tumor and sickness at the stomach, and that plague turned to a severe boil.",
        "76:37": "At that time the two ministers of Pharaoh came from the land of Goshen where all the children of Israel were, and went to the house of Pharaoh and said to him, We have seen the children of Israel slacken in their work and negligent in their labor.",
        "76:38": "And when Pharaoh heard the words of his ministers, his anger was kindled against the children of Israel exceedingly, for he was greatly grieved at his bodily pain.",
        "76:39": "And he answered and said, Now that the children of Israel know that I am ill, they turn and scoff at us, now therefore harness my chariot for me, and I will betake myself to Goshen and will see the scoff of the children of Israel with which they are deriding me; so his servants harnessed the chariot for him.",
        "76:40": "And they took and made him ride upon a horse, for he was not able to ride of himself;",
        "76:41": "And he took with him ten horsemen and ten footmen, and went to the children of Israel to Goshen.",
        "76:42": "And when they had come to the border of Egypt, the king's horse passed into a narrow place, elevated in the hollow part of the vineyard, fenced on both sides, the low, plain country being on the other side.",
        "76:43": "And the horses ran rapidly in that place and pressed each other, and the other horses pressed the king's horse.",
        "76:44": "And the king's horse fell into the low plain whilst the king was riding upon it, and when he fell the chariot turned over the king's face and the horse lay upon the king, and the king cried out, for his flesh was very sore.",
        "76:45": "And the flesh of the king was torn from him, and his bones were broken and he could not ride, for this thing was from the Lord to him, for the Lord had heard the cries of his people the children of Israel and their affliction.",
        "76:46": "And his servants carried him upon their shoulders, a little at a time, and they brought him back to Egypt, and the horsemen who were with him came also back to Egypt.",
        "76:47": "And they placed him in his bed, and the king knew that his end was come to die, so Aparanith the queen his wife came and cried before the king, and the king wept a great weeping with her.",
        "76:48": "And all his nobles and servants came on that day and saw the king in that affliction, and wept a great weeping with him.",
        "76:49": "And the princes of the king and all his counselors advised the king to cause one to reign in his stead in the land, whomsoever he should choose from his sons.",
        "76:50": "And the king had three sons and two daughters which Aparanith the queen his wife had borne to him, besides the king's children of concubines.",
        "76:51": "And these were their names, the firstborn Othri, the second Adikam, and the third Morion, and their sisters, the name of the elder Bathia and of the other Acuzi.",
        "76:52": "And Othri the first born of the king was an idiot, precipitate and hurried in his words.",
        "76:53": "But Adikam was a cunning and wise man and knowing in all the wisdom of Egypt, but of unseemly aspect, thick in flesh, and very short in stature; his height was one cubit.",
        "76:54": "And when the king saw Adikam his son intelligent and wise in all things, the king resolved that he should be king in his stead after his death.",
        "76:55": "And he took for him a wife Gedudah daughter of Abilot, and he was ten years old, and she bare unto him four sons.",
        "76:56": "And he afterward went and took three wives and begat eight sons and three daughters.",
        "76:57": "And the disorder greatly prevailed over the king, and his flesh stank like the flesh of a carcass cast upon the field in summer time, during the heat of the sun.",
        "76:58": "And when the king saw that his sickness had greatly strengthened itself over him, he ordered his son Adikam to be brought to him, and they made him king over the land in his place.",
        "76:59": "And at the end of three years, the king died, in shame, disgrace, and disgust, and his servants carried him and buried him in the sepulcher of the kings of Egypt in Zoan Mizraim.",
        "76:60": "But they embalmed him not as was usual with kings, for his flesh was putrid, and they could not approach to embalm him on account of the stench, so they buried him in haste.",
        "76:61": "For this evil was from the Lord to him, for the Lord had requited him evil for the evil which in his days he had done to Israel.",
        "76:62": "And he died with terror and with shame, and his son Adikam reigned in his place.<",
        "77:1": "Adikam was twenty years old when he reigned over Egypt, he reigned four years.",
        "77:2": "In the two hundred and sixth year of Israel's going down to Egypt did Adikam reign over Egypt, but he continued not so long in his reign over Egypt as his fathers had continued their reigns.",
        "77:3": "For Melol his father reigned ninety-four years in Egypt, but he was ten years sick and died, for he had been wicked before the Lord.",
        "77:4": "And all the Egyptians called the name of Adikam Pharaoh like the name of his fathers, as was their custom to do in Egypt.",
        "77:5": "And all the wise men of Pharaoh called the name of Adikam Ahuz, for short is called Ahuz in the Egyptian language.",
        "77:6": "And Adikam was exceedingly ugly, and he was a cubit and a span and he had a great beard which reached to the soles of his feet.",
        "77:7": "And Pharaoh sat upon his father's throne to reign over Egypt, and he conducted the government of Egypt in his wisdom.",
        "77:8": "And whilst he reigned he exceeded his father and all the preceding kings in wickedness, and he increased his yoke over the children of Israel.",
        "77:9": "And he went with his servants to Goshen to the children of Israel, and he strengthened the labor over them and he said unto them, Complete your work, each day's task, and let not your hands slacken from our work from this day forward as you did in the days of my father.",
        "77:10": "And he placed officers over them from amongst the children of Israel, and over these officers he placed taskmasters from amongst his servants.",
        "77:11": "And he placed over them a measure of bricks for them to do according to that number, day by day, and he turned back and went to Egypt.",
        "77:12": "At that time the task-masters of Pharaoh ordered the officers of the children of Israel according to the command of Pharaoh, saying,",
        "77:13": "Thus says Pharaoh, Do your work each day, and finish your task, and observe the daily measure of bricks; diminish not anything.",
        "77:14": "And it shall come to pass that if you are deficient in your daily bricks, I will put your young children in their stead.",
        "77:15": "And the task-masters of Egypt did so in those days as Pharaoh had ordered them.",
        "77:16": "And whenever any deficiency was found in the children of Israel's measure of their daily bricks, the task-masters of Pharaoh would go to the wives of the children of Israel and take infants of the children of Israel to the number of bricks deficient, they would take them by force from their mother's laps, and put them in the building instead of the bricks;",
        "77:17": "Whilst their fathers and mothers were crying over them and weeping when they heard the weeping voices of their infants in the wall of the building.",
        "77:18": "And the task-masters prevailed over Israel, that the Israelites should place their children in the building, so that a man placed his son in the wall and put mortar over him, whilst his eyes wept over him, and his tears ran down upon his child.",
        "77:19": "And the task-masters of Egypt did so to the babes of Israel for many days, and no one pitied or had compassion over the babes of the children of Israel.",
        "77:20": "And the number of all the children killed in the building was two hundred and seventy, some whom they had built upon instead of the bricks which had been left deficient by their fathers, and some whom they had drawn out dead from the building.",
        "77:21": "And the labor imposed upon the children of Israel in the days of Adikam exceeded in hardship that which they performed in the days of his father.",
        "77:22": "And the children of Israel sighed every day on account of their heavy work, for they had said to themselves, Behold when Pharaoh shall die, his son will rise up and lighten our work!",
        "77:23": "But they increased the latter work more than the former, and the children of Israel sighed at this and their cry ascended to God on account of their labor.",
        "77:24": "And God heard the voice of the children of Israel and their cry, in those days, and God remembered to them his covenant which he had made with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.",
        "77:25": "And God saw the burden of the children of Israel, and their heavy work in those days, and he determined to deliver them.",
        "77:26": "And Moses the son of Amram was still confined in the dungeon in those days, in the house of Reuel the Midianite, and Zipporah the daughter of Reuel did support him with food secretly day by day.",
        "77:27": "And Moses was confined in the dungeon in the house of Reuel for ten years.",
        "77:28": "And at the end of ten years which was the first year of the reign of Pharaoh over Egypt, in the place of his father,",
        "77:29": "Zipporah said to her father Reuel, No person inquires or seeks after the Hebrew man, whom thou didst bind in prison now ten years.",
        "77:30": "Now therefore, if it seem good in thy sight, let us send and see whether he is living or dead, but her father knew not that she had supported him.",
        "77:31": "And Reuel her father answered and said to her, Has ever such a thing happened that a man should be shut up in a prison without food for ten years, and that he should live?",
        "77:32": "And Zipporah answered her father, saying, Surely thou hast heard that the God of the Hebrews is great and awful, and does wonders for them at all times.",
        "77:33": "He it was who delivered Abraham from Ur of the Chaldeans, and Isaac from the sword of his father, and Jacob from the angel of the Lord who wrestled with him at the ford of Jabbuk.",
        "77:34": "Also with this man has he done many things, he delivered him from the river in Egypt and from the sword of Pharaoh, and from the children of Cush, so also can he deliver him from famine and make him live.",
        "77:35": "And the thing seemed good in the sight of Reuel, and he did according to the word of his daughter, and sent to the dungeon to ascertain what became of Moses.",
        "77:36": "And he saw, and behold the man Moses was living in the dungeon, standing upon his feet, praising and praying to the God of his ancestors.",
        "77:37": "And Reuel commanded Moses to be brought out of the dungeon, so they shaved him and he changed his prison garments and ate bread.",
        "77:38": "And afterward Moses went into the garden of Reuel which was behind the house, and he there prayed to the Lord his God, who had done mighty wonders for him.",
        "77:39": "And it was that whilst he prayed he looked opposite to him, and behold a sapphire stick was placed in the ground, which was planted in the midst of the garden.",
        "77:40": "And he approached the stick and he looked, and behold the name of the Lord God of hosts was engraved thereon, written and developed upon the stick.",
        "77:41": "And he read it and stretched forth his hand and he plucked it like a forest tree from the thicket, and the stick was in his hand.",
        "77:42": "And this is the stick with which all the works of our God were performed, after he had created heaven and earth, and all the host of them, seas, rivers and all their fishes.",
        "77:43": "And when God had driven Adam from the garden of Eden, he took the stick in his hand and went and tilled the ground from which he was taken.",
        "77:44": "And the stick came down to Noah and was given to Shem and his descendants, until it came into the hand of Abraham the Hebrew.",
        "77:45": "And when Abraham had given all he had to his son Isaac, he also gave to him this stick.",
        "77:46": "And when Jacob had fled to Padan-aram, he took it into his hand, and when he returned to his father he had not left it behind him.",
        "77:47": "Also when he went down to Egypt he took it into his hand and gave it to Joseph, one portion above his brethren, for Jacob had taken it by force from his brother Esau.",
        "77:48": "And after the death of Joseph, the nobles of Egypt came into the house of Joseph, and the stick came into the hand of Reuel the Midianite, and when he went out of Egypt, he took it in his hand and planted it in his garden.",
        "77:49": "And all the mighty men of the Kinites tried to pluck it when they endeavored to get Zipporah his daughter, but they were unsuccessful.",
        "77:50": "So that stick remained planted in the garden of Reuel, until he came who had a right to it and took it.",
        "77:51": "And when Reuel saw the stick in the hand of Moses, he wondered at it, and he gave him his daughter Zipporah for a wife.",
        "78:1": "At that time died Baal Channan son of Achbor, king of Edom, and was buried in his house in the land of Edom.",
        "78:2": "And after his death the children of Esau sent to the land of Edom, and took from there a man who was in Edom, whose name was Hadad, and they made him king over them in the place of Baal Channan, their king.",
        "78:3": "And Hadad reigned over the children of Edom forty-eight years.",
        "78:4": "And when he reigned he resolved to fight against the children of Moab, to bring them under the power of the children of Esau as they were before, but he was not able, because the children of Moab heard this thing, and they rose up and hastened to elect a king over them from amongst their brethren.",
        "78:5": "And they afterward gathered together a great people, and sent to the children of Ammon their brethren for help to fight against Hadad king of Edom.",
        "78:6": "And Hadad heard the thing which the children of Moab had done, and was greatly afraid of them, and refrained from fighting against them.",
        "78:7": "In those days Moses, the son of Amram, in Midian, took Zipporah, the daughter of Reuel the Midianite, for a wife.",
        "78:8": "And Zipporah walked in the ways of the daughters of Jacob, she was nothing short of the righteousness of Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel and Leah.",
        "78:9": "And Zipporah conceived and bare a son and he called his name Gershom, for he said, I was a stranger in a foreign land; but he circumcised not his foreskin, at the command of Reuel his father-in-law.",
        "78:10": "And she conceived again and bare a son, but circumcised his foreskin, and called his name Eliezer, for Moses said, Because the God of my fathers was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.",
        "78:11": "And Pharaoh king of Egypt greatly increased the labor of the children of Israel in those days, and continued to make his yoke heavier upon the children of Israel.",
        "78:12": "And he ordered a proclamation to be made in Egypt, saying, Give no more straw to the people to make bricks with, let them go and gather themselves straw as they can find it.",
        "78:13": "Also the tale of bricks which they shall make let them give each day, and diminish nothing from them, for they are idle in their work.",
        "78:14": "And the children of Israel heard this, and they mourned and sighed, and they cried unto the Lord on account of the bitterness of their souls.",
        "78:15": "And the Lord heard the cries of the children of Israel, and saw the oppression with which the Egyptians oppressed them.",
        "78:16": "And the Lord was jealous of his people and his inheritance, and heard their voice, and he resolved to take them out of the affliction of Egypt, to give them the land of Canaan for a possession.",
        "79:1": "And in those days Moses was feeding the flock of Reuel the Midianite his father-in-law, beyond the wilderness of Sin, and the stick which he took from his father-in-law was in his hand.",
        "79:2": "And it came to pass one day that a kid of goats strayed from the flock, and Moses pursued it and it came to the mountain of God to Horeb.",
        "79:3": "And when he came to Horeb, the Lord appeared there unto him in the bush, and he found the bush burning with fire, but the fire had no power over the bush to consume it.",
        "79:4": "And Moses was greatly astonished at this sight, wherefore the bush was not consumed, and he approached to see this mighty thing, and the Lord called unto Moses out of the fire and commanded him to go down to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to send the children of Israel from his service.",
        "79:5": "And the Lord said unto Moses, Go, return to Egypt, for all those men who sought thy life are dead, and thou shalt speak unto Pharaoh to send forth the children of Israel from his land.",
        "79:6": "And the Lord showed him to do signs and wonders in Egypt before the eyes of Pharaoh and the eyes of his subjects, in order that they might believe that the Lord had sent him.",
        "79:7": "And Moses hearkened to all that the Lord had commanded him, and he returned to his father-in-law and told him the thing, and Reuel said to him, Go in peace.",
        "79:8": "And Moses rose up to go to Egypt, and he took his wife and sons with him, and he was at an inn in the road, and an angel of God came down, and sought an occasion against him.",
        "79:9": "And he wished to kill him on account of his first born son, because he had not circumcised him, and had transgressed the covenant which the Lord had made with Abraham.",
        "79:10": "For Moses had hearkened to the words of his father-in-law which he had spoken to him, not to circumcise his first born son, therefore he circumcised him not.",
        "79:11": "And Zipporah saw the angel of the Lord seeking an occasion against Moses, and she knew that this thing was owing to his not having circumcised her son Gershom.",
        "79:12": "And Zipporah hastened and took of the sharp rock stones that were there, and she circumcised her son, and delivered her husband and her son from the hand of the angel of the Lord.",
        "79:13": "And Aaron the son of Amram, the brother of Moses, was in Egypt walking at the river side on that day.",
        "79:14": "And the Lord appeared to him in that place, and he said to him, Go now toward Moses in the wilderness, and he went and met him in the mountain of God, and he kissed him.",
        "79:15": "And Aaron lifted up his eyes, and saw Zipporah the wife of Moses and her children, and he said unto Moses, Who are these unto thee?",
        "79:16": "And Moses said unto him, They are my wife and sons, which God gave to me in Midian; and the thing grieved Aaron on account of the woman and her children.",
        "79:17": "And Aaron said to Moses, Send away the woman and her children that they may go to her father's house, and Moses hearkened to the words of Aaron, and did so.",
        "79:18": "And Zipporah returned with her children, and they went to the house of Reuel, and remained there until the time arrived when the Lord had visited his people, and brought them forth from Egypt from the hand at Pharaoh.",
        "79:19": "And Moses and Aaron came to Egypt to the community of the children of Israel, and they spoke to them all the words of the Lord, and the people rejoiced an exceeding great rejoicing.",
        "79:20": "And Moses and Aaron rose up early on the next day, and they went to the house of Pharaoh, and they took in their hands the stick of God.",
        "79:21": "And when they came to the king's gate, two young lions were confined there with iron instruments, and no person went out or came in from before them, unless those whom the king ordered to come, when the conjurors came and withdrew the lions by their incantations, and this brought them to the king.",
        "79:22": "And Moses hastened and lifted up the stick upon the lions, and he loosed them, and Moses and Aaron came into the king's house.",
        "79:23": "The lions also came with them in joy, and they followed them and rejoiced as a dog rejoices over his master when he comes from the field.",
        "79:24": "And when Pharaoh saw this thing he was astonished at it, and he was greatly terrified at the report, for their appearance was like the appearance of the children of God.",
        "79:25": "And Pharaoh said to Moses, What do you require? and they answered him, saying, The Lord God of the Hebrews has sent us to thee, to say, Send forth my people that they may serve me.",
        "79:26": "And when Pharaoh heard their words he was greatly terrified before them, and he said to them, Go today and come back to me tomorrow, and they did according to the word of the king.",
        "79:27": "And when they had gone Pharaoh sent for Balaam the magician and to Jannes and Jambres his sons, and to all the magicians and conjurors and counsellors which belonged to the king, and they all came and sat before the king.",
        "79:28": "And the king told them all the words which Moses and his brother Aaron had spoken to him, and the magicians said to the king, But how came the men to thee, on account of the lions which were confined at the gate?",
        "79:29": "And the king said, Because they lifted up their rod against the lions and loosed them, and came to me, and the lions also rejoiced at them as a dog rejoices to meet his master.",
        "79:30": "And Balaam the son of Beor the magician answered the king, saying, These are none else than magicians like ourselves.",
        "79:31": "Now therefore send for them, and let them come and we will try them, and the king did so.",
        "79:32": "And in the morning Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron to come before the king, and they took the rod of God, and came to the king and spoke to him, saying,",
        "79:33": "Thus said the Lord God of the Hebrews, Send my people that they may serve me.",
        "79:34": "And the king said to them, But who will believe you that you are the messengers of God and that you come to me by his order?",
        "79:35": "Now therefore give a wonder or sign in this matter, and then the words which you speak will be believed.",
        "79:36": "And Aaron hastened and threw the rod out of his hand before Pharaoh and before his servants, and the rod turned into a serpent.",
        "79:37": "And the sorcerers saw this and they cast each man his rod upon the ground and they became serpents.",
        "79:38": "And the serpent of Aaron's rod lifted up its head and opened its mouth to swallow the rods of the magicians.",
        "79:39": "And Balaam the magician answered and said, This thing has been from the days of old, that a serpent should swallow its fellow, and that living things devour each other.",
        "79:40": "Now therefore restore it to a rod as it was at first, and we will also restore our rods as they were at first, and if thy rod shall swallow our rods, then shall we know that the spirit of God is in thee, and if not, thou art only an artificer like unto ourselves.",
        "79:41": "And Aaron hastened and stretched forth his hand and caught hold of the serpent's tail and it became a rod in his hand, and the sorcerers did the like with their rods, and they got hold, each man of the tail of his serpent, and they became rods as at first.",
        "79:42": "And when they were restored to rods, the rod of Aaron swallowed up their rods.",
        "79:43": "And when the king saw this thing, he ordered the book of records that related to the kings of Egypt, to be brought, and they brought the book of records, the chronicles of the kings of Egypt, in which all the idols of Egypt were inscribed, for they thought of finding therein the name of Jehovah, but they found it not.",
        "79:44": "And Pharaoh said to Moses and Aaron, Behold I have not found the name of your God written in this book, and his name I know not.",
        "79:45": "And the counsellors and wise men answered the king, We have heard that the God of the Hebrews is a son of the wise, the son of ancient kings.",
        "79:46": "And Pharaoh turned to Moses and Aaron and said to them, I know not the Lord whom you have declared, neither will I send his people.",
        "79:47": "And they answered and said to the king, The Lord God of Gods is his name, and he proclaimed his name over us from the days of our ancestors, and sent us, saying, Go to Pharaoh and say unto him, Send my people that they may serve me.",
        "79:48": "Now therefore send us, that we may take a journey for three days in the wilderness, and there may sacrifice to him, for from the days of our going down to Egypt, he has not taken from our hands either burnt offering, oblation or sacrifice, and if thou wilt not send us, his anger will be kindled against thee, and he will smite Egypt either with the plague or with the sword.",
        "79:49": "And Pharaoh said to them, Tell me now his power and his might; and they said to him, He created the heaven and the earth, the seas and all their fishes, he formed the light, created the darkness, caused rain upon the earth and watered it, and made the herbage and grass to sprout, he created man and beast and the animals of the forest, the birds of the air and the fish of the sea, and by his mouth they live and die.",
        "79:50": "Surely he created thee in thy mother's womb, and put into thee the breath of life, and reared thee and placed thee upon the royal throne of Egypt, and he will take thy breath and soul from thee, and return thee to the ground whence thou wast taken.",
        "79:51": "And the anger of the king was kindled at their words, and he said to them, But who amongst all the Gods of nations can do this? my river is mine own, and I have made it for myself.",
        "79:52": "And he drove them from him, and he ordered the labor upon Israel to be more severe than it was yesterday and before.",
        "79:53": "And Moses and Aaron went out from the king's presence, and they saw the children of Israel in an evil condition for the task-masters had made their labor exceedingly heavy.",
        "79:54": "And Moses returned to the Lord and said, Why hast thou ill treated thy people? for since I came to speak to Pharaoh what thou didst send me for, he has exceedingly ill used the children of Israel.",
        "79:55": "And the Lord said to Moses, Behold thou wilt see that with an outstretched hand and heavy plagues, Pharaoh will send the children of Israel from his land.",
        "79:56": "And Moses and Aaron dwelt amongst their brethren the children of Israel in Egypt.",
        "79:57": "And as for the children of Israel the Egyptians embittered their lives, with the heavy work which they imposed upon them.",
        "80:1": "And at the end of two years, the Lord again sent Moses to Pharaoh to bring forth the children of Israel, and to send them out of the land of Egypt.",
        "80:2": "And Moses went and came to the house of Pharaoh, and he spoke to him the words of the Lord who had sent him, but Pharaoh would not hearken to the voice of the Lord, and God roused his might in Egypt upon Pharaoh and his subjects, and God smote Pharaoh and his people with very great and sore plagues.",
        "80:3": "And the Lord sent by the hand of Aaron and turned all the waters of Egypt into blood, with all their streams and rivers.",
        "80:4": "And when an Egyptian came to drink and draw water, he looked into his pitcher, and behold all the water was turned into blood; and when he came to drink from his cup the water in the cup became blood.",
        "80:5": "And when a woman kneaded her dough and cooked her victuals, their appearance was turned to that of blood.",
        "80:6": "And the Lord sent again and caused all their waters to bring forth frogs, and all the frogs came into the houses of the Egyptians.",
        "80:7": "And when the Egyptians drank, their bellies were filled with frogs and they danced in their bellies as they dance when in the river.",
        "80:8": "And all their drinking water and cooking water turned to frogs, also when they lay in their beds their perspiration bred frogs.",
        "80:9": "Notwithstanding all this the anger of the Lord did not turn from them, and his hand was stretched out against all the Egyptians to smite them with every heavy plague.",
        "80:10": "And he sent and smote their dust to lice, and the lice became in Egypt to the height of two cubits upon the earth.",
        "80:11": "The lice were also very numerous, in the flesh of man and beast, in all the inhabitants of Egypt, also upon the king and queen the Lord sent the lice, and it grieved Egypt exceedingly on account of the lice.",
        "80:12": "Notwithstanding this, the anger of the Lord did not turn away, and his hand was still stretched out over Egypt.",
        "80:13": "And the Lord sent all kinds of beasts of the field into Egypt, and they came and destroyed all Egypt, man and beast, and trees, and all things that were in Egypt.",

        "80:54": "And Moses said to her, Surely thy brother and his household, and subjects, the families of Egypt, would not hearken to the words of the Lord, therefore did this evil come upon them.",

        "81:58": "Remember what Amalek has done to thee in the road when thou wentest forth from Egypt.",
        "81:59": "Who met thee in the road and smote thy rear, even those that were feeble behind thee when thou wast faint and weary.",
        "81:60": "Therefore it shall be when the Lord thy God shall have given thee rest from all thine enemies round about in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, to possess it, that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven, thou shalt not forget it.",
        "81:61": "And the king who shall have pity on Amalek, or upon his memory or upon his seed, behold I will require it of him, and I will cut him off from amongst his people.",

        "83:6": "On that day the two sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, took strange fire and brought it before the Lord who had not commanded them, and a fire went forth from before the Lord, and consumed them, and they died before the Lord on that day.",
        "83:7": "Then on the day when Moses had completed to erect the sanctuary, the princes of the children of Israel began to bring their offerings before the Lord for the dedication of the altar.",
        "83:8": "And they brought up their offerings each prince for one day, a prince each day for twelve days.",
        "83:9": "And all the offerings which they brought, each man in his day, one silver charger weighing one hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy shekels after the shekel of the sanctuary, both of them full of fine flour, mingled with oil for a meat offering.",

        "83:17": "And in the second month, on the first day thereof, the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,",
        "83:18": "Number the heads of all the males of the children of Israel from twenty years old and upward, thou and thy brother Aaron and the twelve princes of Israel.",
        "83:19": "And Moses did so, and Aaron came with the twelve princes of Israel, and they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.",
        "83:20": "And the numbers of the children of Israel by the houses of their fathers, from twenty years old and upward, were six hundred and three thousand, five hundred and fifty.",
        "83:21": "But the children of Levi were not numbered amongst their brethren the children of Israel.",
        "83:22": "And the number of all the males of the children of Israel from one month old and upward, was twenty-two thousand, two hundred and seventy-three.",

        "83:25": "And on the twentieth day of the month, the cloud was taken away from the tabernacle of testimony.",
        "83:26": "At that time the children of Israel continued their journey from the wilderness of Sinai, and they took a journey of three days, and the cloud rested upon the wilderness of Paran; there the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, for they had provoked the Lord in asking him for meat, that they might eat.",
        "83:27": "And the Lord hearkened to their voice, and gave them meat which they ate for one month.",
        "83:28": "But after this the anger of the Lord was kindled against them, and he smote them with a great slaughter, and they were buried there in that place.",
        "83:29": "And the children of Israel called that place Kebroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people that lusted flesh.",
        "83:30": "And they departed from Kebroth Hattaavah and pitched in Hazeroth, which is in the wilderness of Paran.",
        "83:31": "And whilst the children of Israel were in Hazeroth, the anger of the Lord was kindled against Miriam on account of Moses, and she became leprous, white as snow.",
        "83:32": "And she was confined without the camp for seven days, until she had been received again after her leprosy.",
        "83:33": "The children of Israel afterward departed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the end of the wilderness of Paran.",
        "83:34": "At that time, the Lord spoke to Moses to send twelve men from the children of Israel, one man to a tribe, to go and explore the land of Canaan.",
        "83:35": "And Moses sent the twelve men, and they came to the land of Canaan to search and examine it, and they explored the whole land from the wilderness of Sin to Rechob as thou comest to Chamoth.",
        "83:36": "And at the end of forty days they came to Moses and Aaron, and they brought him word as it was in their hearts, and ten of the men brought up an evil report to the children of Israel, of the land which they had explored, saying, It is better for us to return to Egypt than to go to this land, a land that consumes its inhabitants.",
        "83:37": "But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephuneh, who were of those that explored the land, said, The land is exceedingly good.",
        "83:38": "If the Lord delight in us, then he will bring us to this land and give it to us, for it is a land flowing with milk and honey.",
        "83:39": "But the children of Israel would not hearken to them, and they hearkened to the words of the ten men who had brought up an evil report of the land.",
        "83:40": "And the Lord heard the murmurings of the children of Israel and he was angry and swore, saying,",
        "83:41": "Surely not one man of this wicked generation shall see the land from twenty years old and upward excepting Caleb the son of Jephuneh and Joshua the son of Nun.",
        "83:42": "But surely this wicked generation shall perish in this wilderness, and their children shall come to the land and they shall possess it; so the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness for forty years until the end of that wicked generation, because they did not follow the Lord.",
        "83:43": "And the people dwelt in the wilderness of Paran a long time, and they afterward proceeded to the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.",
        "84:1": "At that time Korah the son of Jetzer the son of Kehath the son of Levi, took many men of the children of Israel, and they rose up and quarreled with Moses and Aaron and the whole congregation.",
        "84:2": "And the Lord was angry with them, and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, with their houses and all belonging to them, and all the men belonging to Korah.",
        "84:3": "And after this God made the people go round by the way of Mount Seir for a long time.",
        "84:4": "At that time the Lord said unto Moses, Provoke not a war against the children of Esau, for I will not give to you of any thing belonging to them, as much as the sole of the foot could tread upon, for I have given Mount Seir for an inheritance to Esau.",
        "84:5": "Therefore did the children of Esau fight against the children of Seir in former times, and the Lord had delivered the children of Seir into the hands of the children of Esau, and destroyed them from before them, and the children of Esau dwelt in their stead unto this day.",
        "84:6": "Therefore the Lord said to the children of Israel, Fight not against the children of Esau your brethren, for nothing in their land belongs to you, but you may buy food of them for money and eat it, and you may buy water of them for money and drink it.",
        "84:7": "And the children of Israel did according to the word of the Lord.",
        "84:8": "And the children of Israel went about the wilderness, going round by the way of Mount Sinai for a long time, and touched not the children of Esau, and they continued in that district for nineteen years.",

        "84:10": "And they buried him in his place which he had built for himself in the land of Chittim, and Abimnas reigned in his place for thirty-eight years.",
        "84:11": "And the children of Israel passed the boundary of the children of Esau in those days, at the end of nineteen years, and they came and passed the road of the wilderness of Moab.",
        "84:12": "And the Lord said to Moses, besiege not Moab, and do not fight against them, for I will give you nothing of their land.",
        "84:13": "And the children of Israel passed the road of the wilderness of Moab for nineteen years, and they did not fight against them.",
        "84:14": "And in the thirty-sixth year of the children of Israel's departing from Egypt the Lord smote the heart of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and he waged war, and went forth to fight against the children of Moab.",
        "84:15": "And Sihon sent messengers to Beor the son of Janeas, the son of Balaam, counsellor to the king of Egypt, and to Balaam his son, to curse Moab, in order that it might be delivered into the hand of Sihon.",
        "84:16": "And the messengers went and brought Beor the son of Janeas, and Balaam his son, from Pethor in Mesopotamia, so Beor and Balaam his son came to the city of Sihon and they cursed Moab and their king in the presence of Sihon king of the Amorites.",
        "84:17": "So Sihon went out with his whole army, and he went to Moab and fought against them, and he subdued them, and the Lord delivered them into his hands, and Sihon slew the king of Moab.",
        "84:18": "And Sihon took all the cities of Moab in the battle; he also took Heshbon from them, for Heshbon was one of the cities of Moab, and Sihon placed his princes and his nobles in Heshbon, and Heshbon belonged to Sihon in those days.",
        "84:19": "Therefore the parable speakers Beor and Balaam his son uttered these words, saying, Come unto Heshbon, the city of Sihon will be built and established.",
        "84:20": "Woe unto thee Moab! thou art lost, O people of Kemosh! behold it is written upon the book of the law of God.",
        "84:21": "And when Sihon had conquered Moab, he placed guards in the cities which he had taken from Moab, and a considerable number of the children of Moab fell in battle into the hand of Sihon, and he made a great capture of them, sons and daughters, and he slew their king; so Sihon turned back to his own land.",
        "84:22": "And Sihon gave numerous presents of silver and gold to Beor and Balaam his son, and he dismissed them, and they went to Mesopotamia to their home and country.",
        "84:23": "At that time all the children of Israel passed from the road of the wilderness of Moab, and returned and surrounded the wilderness of Edom.",
        "84:24": "So the whole congregation came to the wilderness of Sin in the first month of the fortieth year from their departure from Egypt, and the children of Israel dwelt there in Kadesh, of the wilderness of Sin, and Miriam died there and she was buried there.",
        "84:25": "At that time Moses sent messengers to Hadad king of Edom, saying, Thus says thy brother Israel, Let me pass I pray thee through thy land, we will not pass through field or vineyard, we will not drink the water of the well; we will walk in the king's road.",
        "84:26": "And Edom said to him, Thou shalt not pass through my country, and Edom went forth to meet the children of Israel with a mighty people.",
        "84:27": "And the children of Esau refused to let the children of Israel pass through their land, so the Israelites removed from them and fought not against them.",
        "84:28": "For before this the Lord had commanded the children of Israel, saying, You shall not fight against the children of Esau, therefore the Israelites removed from them and did not fight against them.",
        "84:29": "So the children of Israel departed from Kadesh, and all the people came to Mount Hor.",
        "84:30": "At that time the Lord said to Moses, Tell thy brother Aaron that he shall die there, for he shall not come to the land which I have given to the children of Israel.",
        "84:31": "And Aaron went up, at the command of the Lord, to Mount Hor, in the fortieth year, in the fifth month, in the first day of the month.",
        "84:32": "And Aaron was one hundred and twenty-three years old when he died in Mount Hor",
        "85:1": "And king Arad the Canaanite, who dwelt in the south, heard that the Israelites had come by the way of the spies, and he arranged his forces to fight against the Israelites.",
        "85:2": "And the children of Israel were greatly afraid of him, for he had a great and heavy army, so the children of Israel resolved to return to Egypt.",
        "85:3": "And the children of Israel turned back about the distance of three days' journey unto Maserath Beni Jaakon, for they were greatly afraid on account of the king Arad.",
        "85:4": "And the children of Israel would not get back to their places, so they remained in Beni Jaakon for thirty days.",
        "85:5": "And when the children of Levi saw that the children of Israel would not turn back, they were jealous for the sake of the Lord, and they rose up and fought against the Israelites their brethren, and slew of them a great body, and forced them to turn back to their place, Mount Hor.",
        "85:6": "And when they returned, king Arad was still arranging his host for battle against the Israelites.",
        "85:7": "And Israel vowed a vow, saying, If thou wilt deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.",
        "85:8": "And the Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel, and he delivered the Canaanites into their hand, and he utterly destroyed them and their cities, and he called the name of the place Hormah.",
        "85:9": "And the children of Israel journeyed from Mount Hor and pitched in Oboth, and they journeyed from Oboth and they pitched at Ije-abarim, in the border of Moab.",
        "85:10": "And the children of Israel sent to Moab, saying, Let us pass now through thy land into our place, but the children of Moab would not suffer the children of Israel to pass through their land, for the children of Moab were greatly afraid lest the children of Israel should do unto them as Sihon king of the Amorites had done to them, who had taken their land and had slain many of them.",
        "85:11": "Therefore Moab would not suffer the Israelites to pass through his land, and the Lord commanded the children of Israel, saying, That they should not fight against Moab, so the Israelites removed from Moab.",
        "85:12": "And the children of Israel journeyed from the border of Moab, and they came to the other side of Arnon, the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites, and they pitched in the border of Sihon, king of the Amorites, in the wilderness of Kedemoth.",
        "85:13": "And the children of Israel sent messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, saying,",
        "85:14": "Let us pass through thy land, we will not turn into the fields or into the vineyards, we will go along by the king's highway until we shall have passed thy border, but Sihon would not suffer the Israelites to pass.",
        "85:15": "So Sihon collected all the people of the Amorites and went forth into the wilderness to meet the children of Israel, and he fought against Israel in Jahaz.",
        "85:16": "And the Lord delivered Sihon king of the Amorites into the hand of the children of Israel, and Israel smote all the people of Sihon with the edge of the sword and avenged the cause of Moab.",
        "85:17": "And the children of Israel took possession of the land of Sihon from Aram unto Jabuk, unto the children of Ammon, and they took all the spoil of the cities.",
        "85:18": "And Israel took all these cities, and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites.",
        "85:19": "And all the children of Israel resolved to fight against the children of Ammon, to take their land also.",
        "85:20": "So the Lord said to the children of Israel, Do not besiege the children of Ammon, neither stir up battle against them, for I will give nothing to you of their land, and the children of Israel hearkened to the word of the Lord, and did not fight against the children of Ammon.",
        "85:21": "And the children of Israel turned and went up by the way of Bashan to the land of Og, king of Bashan, and Og the king of Bashan went out to meet the Israelites in battle, and he had with him many valiant men, and a very strong force from the people of the Amorites.",
        "85:22": "And Og king of Bashan was a very powerful man, but Naaron his son was exceedingly powerful, even stronger than he was.",
        "85:23": "And Og said in his heart, Behold now the whole camp of Israel takes up a space of three parsa, now will I smite them at once without sword or spear.",
        "85:24": "And Og went up Mount Jahaz, and took therefrom one large stone, the length of which was three parsa, and he placed it on his head, and resolved to throw it upon the camp of the children of Israel, to smite all the Israelites with that stone.",
        "85:25": "And the angel of the Lord came and pierced the stone upon the head of Og, and the stone fell upon the neck of Og that Og fell to the earth on account of the weight of the stone upon his neck.",
        "85:26": "At that time the Lord said to the children of Israel, Be not afraid of him, for I have given him and all his people and all his land into your hand, and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon.",
        "85:27": "And Moses went down to him with a small number of the children of Israel, and Moses smote Og with a stick at the ankles of his feet and slew him.",
        "85:28": "The children of Israel afterward pursued the children of Og and all his people, and they beat and destroyed them till there was no remnant left of them.",
        "85:29": "Moses afterward sent some of the children of Israel to spy out Jaazer, for Jaazer was a very famous city.",
        "85:30": "And the spies went to Jaazer and explored it, and the spies trusted in the Lord, and they fought against the men of Jaazer.",
        "85:31": "And these men took Jaazer and its villages, and the Lord delivered them into their hand, and they drove out the Amorites who had been there.",
        "85:32": "And the children of Israel took the land of the two kings of the Amorites, sixty cities which were on the other side of Jordan, from the brook of Arnon unto Mount Herman.",
        "85:33": "And the children of Israel journeyed and came into the plain of Moab which is on this side of Jordan, by Jericho.",
        "85:34": "And the children of Moab heard all the evil which the children of Israel had done to the two kings of the Amorites, to Sihon and Og, so all the men of Moab were greatly afraid of the Israelites.",
        "85:35": "And the elders of Moab said, Behold the two kings of the Amorites, Sihon and Og, who were more powerful than all the kings of the earth, could not stand against the children of Israel, how then can we stand before them?",
        "85:36": "Surely they sent us a message before now to pass through our land on their way, and we would not suffer them, now they will turn upon us with their heavy swords and destroy us; and Moab was distressed on account of the children of Israel, and they were greatly afraid of them, and they counselled together what was to be done to the children of Israel.",
        "85:37": "And the elders of Moab resolved and took one of their men, Balak the son of Zippor the Moabite, and made him king over them at that time, and Balak was a very wise man.",
        "85:38": "And the elders of Moab rose up and sent to the children of Midian to make peace with them, for a great battle and enmity had been in those days between Moab and Midian, from the days of Hadad the son of Bedad king of Edom, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, unto these days.",
        "85:39": "And the children of Moab sent to the children of Midian, and they made peace with them, and the elders of Midian came to the land of Moab to make peace in behalf of the children of Midian.",
        "85:40": "And the elders of Moab counselled with the elders of Midian what to do in order to save their lives from Israel.",
        "85:41": "And all the children of Moab said to the elders of Midian, Now therefore the children of Israel lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field, for thus did they do to the two kings of the Amorites who are stronger than we are.",
        "85:42": "And the elders of Midian said to Moab, We have heard that at the time when Sihon king of the Amorites fought against you, when he prevailed over you and took your land, he had sent to Beor the son of Janeas and to Balaam his son from Mesopotamia, and they came and cursed you; therefore did the hand of Sihon prevail over you, that he took your land.",
        "85:43": "Now therefore send you also to Balaam his son, for he still remains in his land, and give him his hire, that he may come and curse all the people of whom you are afraid; so the elders of Moab heard this thing, and it pleased them to send to Balaam the son of Beor.",
        "85:44": "So Balak the son of Zippor king of Moab sent messengers to Balaam, saying,",
        "85:45": "Behold there is a people come out from Egypt, behold they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me.",
        "85:46": "Now therefore come and curse this people for me, for they are too mighty for me, peradventure I shall prevail to fight against them, and drive them out, for I heard that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and whom thou cursest is cursed.",
        "85:47": "So the messengers of Balak went to Balaam and brought Balaam to curse the people to fight against Moab.",
        "85:48": "And Balaam came to Balak to curse Israel, and the Lord said to Balaam, Curse not this people for it is blessed.",
        "85:49": "And Balak urged Balaam day by day to curse Israel, but Balaam hearkened not to Balak on account of the word of the Lord which he had spoken to Balaam.",
        "85:50": "And when Balak saw that Balaam would not accede to his wish, he rose up and went home, and Balaam also returned to his land and he went from there to Midian.",
        "85:51": "And the children of Israel journeyed from the plain of Moab, and pitched by Jordan from Beth-jesimoth even unto Abel-shittim, at the end of the plains of Moab.",
        "85:52": "And when the children of Israel abode in the plain of Shittim, they began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab.",
        "85:53": "And the children of Israel approached Moab, and the children of Moab pitched their tents opposite to the camp of the children of Israel.",
        "85:54": "And the children of Moab were afraid of the children of Israel, and the children of Moab took all their daughters and their wives of beautiful aspect and comely appearance, and dressed them in gold and silver and costly garments.",
        "85:55": "And the children of Moab seated those women at the door of their tents, in order that the children of Israel might see them and turn to them, and not fight against Moab.",
        "85:56": "And all the children of Moab did this thing to the children of Israel, and every man placed his wife and daughter at the door of his tent, and all the children of Israel saw the act of the children of Moab, and the children of Israel turned to the daughters of Moab and coveted them, and they went to them.",
        "85:57": "And it came to pass that when a Hebrew came to the door of the tent of Moab, and saw a daughter of Moab and desired her in his heart, and spoke with her at the door of the tent that which he desired, whilst they were speaking together the men of the tent would come out and speak to the Hebrew like unto these words:",
        "85:58": "Surely you know that we are brethren, we are all the descendants of Lot and the descendants of Abraham his brother, wherefore then will you not remain with us, and wherefore will you not eat our bread and our sacrifice?",
        "85:59": "And when the children of Moab had thus overwhelmed him with their speeches, and enticed him by their flattering words, they seated him in the tent and cooked and sacrificed for him, and he ate of their sacrifice and of their bread.",
        "85:60": "They then gave him wine and he drank and became intoxicated, and they placed before him a beautiful damsel, and he did with her as he liked, for he knew not what he was doing, as he had drunk plentifully of wine.",
        "85:61": "Thus did the children of Moab to Israel in that place, in the plain of Shittim, and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel on account of this matter, and he sent a pestilence amongst them, and there died of the Israelites twenty-four thousand men.",
        "85:62": "Now there was a man of the children of Simeon whose name was Zimri, the son of Salu, who connected himself with the Midianite Cosbi, the daughter of Zur, king of Midian, in the sight of all the children of Israel.",
        "85:63": "And Phineas the son of Elazer, the son of Aaron the priest, saw this wicked thing which Zimri had done, and he took a spear and rose up and went after them, and pierced them both and slew them, and the pestilence ceased from the children of Israel.",
        "86:1": "At that time after the pestilence, the Lord said to Moses, and to Elazer the son of Aaron the priest, saying,",
        "86:2": "Number the heads of the whole community of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, all that went forth in the army.",
        "86:3": "And Moses and Elazer numbered the children of Israel after their families, and the number of all Israel was seven hundred thousand, seven hundred and thirty.",
        "86:4": "And the number of the children of Levi, from one month old and upward, was twenty-three thousand, and amongst these there was not a man of those numbered by Moses and Aaron in the wilderness of Sinai.",
        "86:5": "For the Lord had told them that they would die in the wilderness, so they all died, and not one had been left of them excepting Caleb the son of Jephuneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.",
        "86:6": "And it was after this that the Lord said to Moses, Say unto the children of Israel to avenge upon Midian the cause of their brethren the children of Israel.",
        "86:7": "And Moses did so, and the children of Israel chose from amongst them twelve thousand men, being one thousand to a tribe, and they went to Midian.",
        "86:8": "And the children of Israel warred against Midian, and they slew every male, also the five princes of Midian, and Balaam the son of Beor did they slay with the sword.",
        "86:9": "And the children of Israel took the wives of Midian captive, with their little ones and their cattle, and all belonging to them.",
        "86:10": "And they took all the spoil and all the prey, and they brought it to Moses and to Elazer to the plains of Moab.",
        "86:11": "And Moses and Elazer and all the princes of the congregation went forth to meet them with joy.",
        "86:12": "And they divided all the spoil of Midian, and the children of Israel had been revenged upon Midian for the cause of their brethren the children of Israel.",
        "87:1": "At that time the Lord said to Moses, Behold thy days are approaching to an end, take now Joshua the son of Nun thy servant and place him in the tabernacle, and I will command him, and Moses did so.",
        "87:2": "And the Lord appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood at the entrance of the tabernacle.",
        "87:3": "And the Lord commanded Joshua the son of Nun and said unto him, Be strong and courageous, for thou shalt bring the children of Israel to the land which I swore to give them, and I will be with thee.",
        "87:4": "And Moses said to Joshua, Be strong and courageous, for thou wilt make the children of Israel inherit the land, and the Lord will be with thee, he will not leave thee nor forsake thee, be not afraid nor disheartened.",
        "87:5": "And Moses called to all the children of Israel and said to them, You have seen all the good which the Lord your God has done for you in the wilderness.",
        "87:6": "Now therefore observe all the words of this law, and walk in the way of the Lord your God, turn not from the way which the Lord has commanded you, either to the right or to the left.",
        "87:7": "And Moses taught the children of Israel statutes and judgments and laws to do in the land as the Lord had commanded him.",
        "87:8": "And he taught them the way of the Lord and his laws; behold they are written upon the book of the law of God which he gave to the children of Israel by the hand of Moses.",
        "87:9": "And Moses finished commanding the children of Israel, and the Lord said to him, saying, Go up to the Mount Abarim and die there, and be gathered unto thy people as Aaron thy brother was gathered.",
        "87:10": "And Moses went up as the Lord had commanded him, and he died there in the land of Moab by the order of the Lord, in the fortieth year from the Israelites going forth from the land of Egypt.",
        "87:11": "And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab for thirty days, and the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were completed.",
        "88:1": "And it was after the death of Moses that the Lord said to Joshua the son of Nun, saying,",
        "88:2": "Rise up and pass the Jordan to the land which I have given to the children of Israel, and thou shalt make the children of Israel inherit the land.",
        "88:3": "Every place upon which the sole of your feet shall tread shall belong to you, from the wilderness of Lebanon unto the great river the river of Perath shall be your boundary.",
        "88:4": "No man shall stand up against thee all the days of thy life; as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee, only be strong and of good courage to observe all the law which Moses commanded thee, turn not from the way either to the right or to the left, in order that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest.",
        "88:5": "And Joshua commanded the officers of Israel, saying, Pass through the camp and command the people, saying, Prepare for yourselves provisions, for in three days more you will pass the Jordan to possess the land.",
        "88:6": "And the officers of the children of Israel did so, and they commanded the people and they did all that Joshua had commanded.",
        "88:7": "And Joshua sent two men to spy out the land of Jericho, and the men went and spied out Jericho.",
        "88:8": "And at the end of seven days they came to Joshua in the camp and said to him, The Lord has delivered the whole land into our hand, and the inhabitants thereof are melted with fear because of us.",
        "88:9": "And it came to pass after that, that Joshua rose up in the morning and all Israel with him, and they journeyed from Shittim, and Joshua and all Israel with him passed the Jordan; and Joshua was eighty-two years old when he passed the Jordan with Israel.",
        "88:10": "And the people went up from Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and they encamped in Gilgal at the eastern corner of Jericho.",
        "88:11": "And the children of Israel kept the Passover in Gilgal, in the plains of Jericho, on the fourteenth day at the month, as it is written in the law of Moses.",
        "88:12": "And the manna ceased at that time on the morrow of the Passover, and there was no more manna for the children of Israel, and they ate of the produce of the land of Canaan.",
        "88:13": "And Jericho was entirely closed against the children of Israel, no one came out or went in.",
        "88:14": "And it was in the second month, on the first day of the month, that the Lord said to Joshua, Rise up, behold I have given Jericho into thy hand with all the people thereof; and all your fighting men shall go round the city, once each day, thus shall you do for six days.",
        "88:15": "And the priests shall blow upon trumpets, and when you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall give a great shouting, that the walls of the city shall fall down; all the people shall go up every man against his opponent.",
        "88:16": "And Joshua did so according to all that the Lord had commanded him.",
        "88:17": "And on the seventh day they went round the city seven times, and the priests blew upon trumpets.",
        "88:18": "And at the seventh round, Joshua said to the people, Shout, for the Lord has delivered the whole city into our hands.",
        "88:19": "Only the city and all that it contains shall be accursed to the Lord, and keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest you make the camp of Israel accursed and trouble it.",
        "88:20": "But all the silver and gold and brass and iron shall be consecrated to the Lord, they shall come into the treasury of the Lord.",
        "88:21": "And the people blew upon trumpets and made a great shouting, and the walls of Jericho fell down, and all the people went up, every man straight before him, and they took the city and utterly destroyed all that was in it, both man and woman, young and old, ox and sheep and ass, with the edge of the sword.",
        "88:22": "And they burned the whole city with fire; only the vessels of silver and gold, and brass and iron, they put into the treasury of the Lord.",
        "88:23": "And Joshua swore at that time, saying, Cursed be the man who builds Jericho; he shall lay the foundation thereof in his first-born, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates thereof.",
        "88:24": "And Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, son of Judah, dealt treacherously in the accursed thing, and he took of the accursed thing and hid it in the tent, and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel.",
        "88:25": "And it was after this when the children of Israel had returned from burning Jericho, Joshua sent men to spy out also Ai, and to fight against it.",
        "88:26": "And the men went up and spied out Ai, and they returned and said, Let not all the people go up with thee to Ai, only let about three thousand men go up and smite the city, for the men thereof are but few.",
        "88:27": "And Joshua did so, and there went up with him of the children of Israel about three thousand men, and they fought against the men of Ai.",
        "88:28": "And the battle was severe against Israel, and the men of Ai smote thirty-six men of Israel, and the children of Israel fled from before the men of Ai.",
        "88:29": "And when Joshua saw this thing, he tore his garments and fell upon his face to the ground before the Lord, he, with the elders of Israel, and they put dust upon their heads.",
        "88:30": "And Joshua said, Why O Lord didst thou bring this people over the Jordan? what shall I say after the Israelites have turned their backs against their enemies?",
        "88:31": "Now therefore all the Canaanites, inhabitants of the land, will hear this thing, and surround us and cut off our name.",
        "88:32": "And the Lord said to Joshua, Why dost thou fall upon thy face? rise, get thee off, for the Israelites have sinned, and taken of the accursed thing; I will no more be with them unless they destroy the accursed thing from amongst them.",
        "88:33": "And Joshua rose up and assembled the people, and brought the Urim by the order of the Lord, and the tribe of Judah was taken, and Achan the son of Carmi was taken.",
        "88:34": "And Joshua said to Achan, Tell me my son, what hast thou done, and Achan said, I saw amongst the spoil a goodly garment of Shinar and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight; I coveted them and took them, and behold they are all hid in the earth in the midst of the tent.",
        "88:35": "And Joshua sent men who went and took them from the tent of Achan, and they brought them to Joshua.",
        "88:36": "And Joshua took Achan and these utensils, and his sons and daughters and all belonging to him, and they brought them into the valley of Achor.",
        "88:37": "And Joshua burned them there with fire, and all the Israelites stoned Achan with stones, and they raised over him a heap of stones, therefore did he call that place the valley of Achor, so the Lord's anger was appeased, and Joshua afterward came to the city and fought against it.",
        "88:38": "And the Lord said to Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed, behold I have given into thy hand Ai, her king and her people, and thou shalt do unto them as thou didst to Jericho and her king, only the spoil thereof and the cattle thereof shall you take for a prey for yourselves; lay an ambush for the city behind it.",
        "88:39": "So Joshua did according to the word of the Lord, and he chose from amongst the sons of war thirty thousand valiant men, and he sent them, and they lay in ambush for the city.",
        "88:40": "And he commanded them, saying, When you shall see us we will flee before them with cunning, and they will pursue us, you shall then rise out of the ambush and take the city, and they did so.",
        "88:41": "And Joshua fought, and the men of the city went out toward Israel, not knowing that they were lying in ambush for them behind the city.",
        "88:42": "And Joshua and all the Israelites feigned themselves wearied out before them, and they fled by the way of the wilderness with cunning.",
        "88:43": "And the men of Ai gathered all the people who were in the city to pursue the Israelites, and they went out and were drawn away from the city, not one remained, and they left the city open and pursued the Israelites.",
        "88:44": "And those who were lying in ambush rose up out of their places, and hastened to come to the city and took it and set it on fire, and the men of Ai turned back, and behold the smoke of the city ascended to the skies, and they had no means of retreating either one way or the other.",
        "88:45": "And all the men of Ai were in the midst of Israel, some on this side and some on that side, and they smote them so that not one of them remained.",
        "88:46": "And the children of Israel took Melosh king of Ai alive, and they brought him to Joshua, and Joshua hanged him on a tree and he died.",
        "88:47": "And the children of Israel returned to the city after having burned it, and they smote all those that were in it with the edge of the sword.",
        "88:48": "And the number of those that had fallen of the men of Ai, both man and woman, was twelve thousand; only the cattle and the spoil of the city they took to themselves, according to the word of the Lord to Joshua.",
        "88:49": "And all the kings on this side Jordan, all the kings of Canaan, heard of the evil which the children of Israel had done to Jericho and to Ai, and they gathered themselves together to fight against Israel.",
        "88:50": "Only the inhabitants of Gibeon were greatly afraid of fighting against the Israelites lest they should perish, so they acted cunningly, and they came to Joshua and to all Israel, and said unto them, We have come from a distant land, now therefore make a covenant with us.",
        "88:51": "And the inhabitants of Gibeon over-reached the children of Israel, and the children of Israel made a covenant with them, and they made peace with them, and the princes of the congregation swore unto them, but afterward the children of Israel knew that they were neighbors to them and were dwelling amongst them.",
        "88:52": "But the children of Israel slew them not; for they had sworn to them by the Lord, and they became hewers of wood and drawers of water.",
        "88:53": "And Joshua said to them, Why did you deceive me, to do this thing to us? and they answered him, saying, Because it was told to thy servants all that you had done to all the kings of the Amorites, and we were greatly afraid of our lives, and we did this thing.",
        "88:54": "And Joshua appointed them on that day to hew wood and to draw water, and he divided them for slaves to all the tribes of Israel.",
        "88:55": "And when Adonizedek king of Jerusalem heard all that the children of Israel had done to Jericho and to Ai, he sent to Hoham king of Hebron and to Piram king at Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish and to Deber king of Eglon, saying,",
        "88:56": "Come up to me and help me, that we may smite the children of Israel and the inhabitants of Gibeon who have made peace with the children of Israel.",
        "88:57": "And they gathered themselves together and the five kings of the Amorites went up with all their camps, a mighty people numerous as the sand of the sea shore.",
        "88:58": "And all these kings came and encamped before Gibeon, and they began to fight against the inhabitants of Gibeon, and all the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua, saying, Come up quickly to us and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites have gathered together to fight against us.",
        "88:59": "And Joshua and all the fighting people went up from Gilgal, and Joshua came suddenly to them, and smote these five kings with a great slaughter.",
        "88:60": "And the Lord confounded them before the children at Israel, who smote them with a terrible slaughter in Gibeon, and pursued them along the way that goes up to Beth Horon unto Makkedah, and they fled from before the children of Israel.",
        "88:61": "And whilst they were fleeing, the Lord sent upon them hailstones from heaven, and more of them died by the hailstones, than by the slaughter of the children of Israel.",
        "88:62": "And the children of Israel pursued them, and they still smote them in the road, going on and smiting them.",
        "88:63": "And when they were smiting, the day was declining toward evening, and Joshua said in the sight of all the people, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon, and thou moon in the valley of Ajalon, until the nation shall have revenged itself upon its enemies.",
        "88:64": "And the Lord hearkened to the voice of Joshua, and the sun stood still in the midst of the heavens, and it stood still six and thirty moments, and the moon also stood still and hastened not to go down a whole day.",
        "88:65": "And there was no day like that, before it or after it, that the Lord hearkened to the voice of a man, for the Lord fought for Israel.",
        "89:1": "Then spoke Joshua this song, on the day that the Lord had given the Amorites into the hand of Joshua and the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of all Israel,",
        "89:2": "Thou hast done mighty things, O Lord, thou hast performed great deeds; who is like unto thee? my lips shall sing to thy name.",
        "89:3": "My goodness and my fortress, my high tower, I will sing a new song unto thee, with thanksgiving will I sing to thee, thou art the strength of my salvation.",
        "89:4": "All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, the princes of the world shall sing to thee, the children of Israel shall rejoice in thy salvation, they shall sing and praise thy power.",
        "89:5": "To thee, O Lord, did we confide; we said thou art our God, for thou wast our shelter and strong tower against our enemies.",
        "89:6": "To thee we cried and were not ashamed, in thee we trusted and were delivered; when we cried unto thee, thou didst hear our voice, thou didst deliver our souls from the sword, thou didst show unto us thy grace, thou didst give unto us thy salvation, thou didst rejoice our hearts with thy strength.",
        "89:7": "Thou didst go forth for our salvation, with thine arm thou didst redeem thy people; thou didst answer us from the heavens of thy holiness, thou didst save us from ten thousands of people.",
        "89:8": "The sun and moon stood still in heaven, and thou didst stand in thy wrath against our oppressors and didst command thy judgments over them.",
        "89:9": "All the princes of the earth stood up, the kings of the nations had gathered themselves together, they were not moved at thy presence, they desired thy battles.",
        "89:10": "Thou didst rise against them in thine anger, and didst bring down thy wrath upon them; thou didst destroy them in thine anger, and cut them off in thine heart.",
        "89:11": "Nations have been consumed with thy fury, kingdoms have declined because of thy wrath, thou didst wound kings in the day of thine anger.",
        "89:12": "Thou didst pour out thy fury upon them, thy wrathful anger took hold of them; thou didst turn their iniquity upon them, and didst cut them off in their wickedness.",
        "89:13": "They did spread a trap, they fell therein, in the net they hid, their foot was caught.",
        "89:14": "Thine hand was ready for all thine enemies who said, Through their sword they possessed the land, through their arm they dwelt in the city; thou didst fill their faces with shame, thou didst bring their horns down to the ground, thou didst terrify them in thy wrath, and didst destroy them in thine anger.",
        "89:15": "The earth trembled and shook at the sound of thy storm over them, thou didst not withhold their souls from death, and didst bring down their lives to the grave.",
        "89:16": "Thou didst pursue them in thy storm, thou didst consume them in thy whirlwind, thou didst turn their rain into hail, they fell in deep pits so that they could not rise.",
        "89:17": "Their carcasses were like rubbish cast out in the middle of the streets.",
        "89:18": "They were consumed and destroyed in thine anger, thou didst save thy people with thy might.",
        "89:19": "Therefore our hearts rejoice in thee, our souls exalt in thy salvation.",
        "89:20": "Our tongues shall relate thy might, we will sing and praise thy wondrous works.",
        "89:21": "For thou didst save us from our enemies, thou didst deliver us from those who rose up against us, thou didst destroy them from before us and depress them beneath our feet.",
        "89:22": "Thus shall all thine enemies perish O Lord, and the wicked shall be like chaff driven by the wind, and thy beloved shall be like trees planted by the waters.",
        "89:23": "So Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp in Gilgal, after having smitten all the kings, so that not a remnant was left of them.",
        "89:24": "And the five kings fled alone on foot from battle, and hid themselves in a cave, and Joshua sought for them in the field of battle, and did not find them.",
        "89:25": "And it was afterward told to Joshua, saying, The kings are found and behold they are hidden in a cave.",
        "89:26": "And Joshua said, Appoint men to be at the mouth of the cave, to guard them, lest they take themselves away; and the children of Israel did so.",
        "89:27": "And Joshua called to all Israel and said to the officers of battle, Place your feet upon the necks of these kings, and Joshua said, So shall the Lord do to all your enemies.",
        "89:28": "And Joshua commanded afterward that they should slay the kings and cast them into the cave, and to put great stones at the mouth of the cave.",
        "89:29": "And Joshua went afterward with all the people that were with him on that day to Makkedah, and he smote it with the edge of the sword.",
        "89:30": "And he utterly destroyed the souls and all belonging to the city, and he did to the king and people thereof as he had done to Jericho.",
        "89:31": "And he passed from there to Libnah and he fought against it, and the Lord delivered it into his hand, and Joshua smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls thereof, and he did to it and to the king thereof as he had done to Jericho.",
        "89:32": "And from there he passed on to Lachish to fight against it, and Horam king of Gaza went up to assist the men of Lachish, and Joshua smote him and his people until there was none left to him.",
        "89:33": "And Joshua took Lachish and all the people thereof, and he did to it as he had done to Libnah.",
        "89:34": "And Joshua passed from there to Eglon, and he took that also, and he smote it and all the people thereof with the edge of the sword.",
        "89:35": "And from there he passed to Hebron and fought against it and took it and utterly destroyed it, and he returned from there with all Israel to Debir and fought against it and smote it with the edge of the sword.",
        "89:36": "And he destroyed every soul in it, he left none remaining, and he did to it and the king thereof as he had done to Jericho.",
        "89:37": "And Joshua smote all the kings of the Amorites from Kadesh-barnea to Azah, and he took their country at once, for the Lord had fought for Israel.",
        "89:38": "And Joshua with all Israel came to the camp to Gilgal.",
        "89:39": "When at that time Jabin king of Chazor heard all that Joshua had done to the kings of the Amorites, Jabin sent to Jobat king of Midian, and to Laban king of Shimron, to Jephal king of Achshaph, and to all the kings of the Amorites, saying,",
        "89:40": "Come quickly to us and help us, that we may smite the children of Israel, before they come upon us and do unto us as they have done to the other kings of the Amorites.",
        "89:41": "And all these kings hearkened to the words of Jabin, king of Chazor, and they went forth with all their camps, seventeen kings, and their people were as numerous as the sand on the sea shore, together with horses and chariots innumerable, and they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, and they were met together to fight against Israel.",
        "89:42": "And the Lord said to Joshua, Fear them not, for tomorrow about this time I will deliver them up all slain before you, thou shalt hough their horses and burn their chariots with fire.",
        "89:43": "And Joshua with all the men of war came suddenly upon them and smote them, and they fell into their hands, for the Lord had delivered them into the hands of the children of Israel.",
        "89:44": "So the children of Israel pursued all these kings with their camps, and smote them until there was none left of them, and Joshua did to them as the Lord had spoken to him.",
        "89:45": "And Joshua returned at that time to Chazor and smote it with the sword and destroyed every soul in it and burned it with fire, and from Chazor, Joshua passed to Shimron and smote it and utterly destroyed it.",
        "89:46": "From there he passed to Achshaph and he did to it as he had done to Shimron.",
        "89:47": "From there he passed to Adulam and he smote all the people in it, and he did to Adulam as he had done to Achshaph and to Shimron.",
        "89:48": "And he passed from them to all the cities of the kings which he had smitten, and he smote all the people that were left of them and he utterly destroyed them.",
        "89:49": "Only their booty and cattle the Israelites took to themselves as a prey, but every human being they smote, they suffered not a soul to live.",
        "89:50": "As the Lord had commanded Moses so did Joshua and all Israel, they failed not in anything.",
        "89:51": "So Joshua and all the children of Israel smote the whole land of Canaan as the Lord had commanded them, and smote all their kings, being thirty and one kings, and the children of Israel took their whole country.",
        "89:52": "Besides the kingdoms of Sihon and Og which are on the other side Jordan, of which Moses had smitten many cities, and Moses gave them to the Reubenites and the Gadites and to half the tribe of Manasseh.",
        "89:53": "And Joshua smote all the kings that were on this side Jordan to the west, and gave them for an inheritance to the nine tribes and to the half tribe of Israel.",
        "89:54": "For five years did Joshua carry on the war with these kings, and he gave their cities to the Israelites, and the land became tranquil from battle throughout the cities of the Amorites and the Canaanites.",
        "90:1": "At that time in the fifth year after the children of Israel had passed over Jordan, after the children of Israel had rested from their war with the Canaanites, at that time great and severe battles arose between Edom and the children of Chittim, and the children of Chittim fought against Edom.",
        "90:2": "And Abianus king of Chittim went forth in that year, that is in the thirty-first year of his reign, and a great force with him of the mighty men of the children of Chittim, and he went to Seir to fight against the children of Esau.",
        "90:3": "And Hadad the king of Edom heard of his report, and he went forth to meet him with a heavy people and strong force, and engaged in battle with him in the field of Edom.",
        "90:4": "And the hand of Chittim prevailed over the children of Esau, and the children of Chittim slew of the children of Esau, two and twenty thousand men, and all the children of Esau fled from before them.",
        "90:5": "And the children of Chittim pursued them and they reached Hadad king of Edom, who was running before them and they caught him alive, and brought him to Abianus king of Chittim.",
        "90:6": "And Abianus ordered him to be slain, and Hadad king of Edom died in the forty-eighth year of his reign.",
        "90:7": "And the children of Chittim continued their pursuit of Edom, and they smote them with a great slaughter and Edom became subject to the children of Chittim.",
        "90:8": "And the children of Chittim ruled over Edom, and Edom became under the hand of the children of Chittim and became one kingdom from that day.",
        "90:9": "And from that time they could no more lift up their heads, and their kingdom became one with the children of Chittim.",
        "90:10": "And Abianus placed officers in Edom and all the children of Edom became subject and tributary to Abianus, and Abianus turned back to his own land, Chittim.",
        "90:11": "And when he returned he renewed his government and built for himself a spacious and fortified palace for a royal residence, and reigned securely over the children of Chittim and over Edom.",
        "90:12": "In those days, after the children of Israel had driven away all the Canaanites and the Amorites, Joshua was old and advanced in years.",
        "90:13": "And the Lord said to Joshua, Thou art old, advanced in life, and a great part of the land remains to be possessed.",
        "90:14": "Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes and to the half tribe of Manasseh, and Joshua rose up and did as the Lord had spoken to him.",
        "90:15": "And he divided the whole land to the tribes of Israel as an inheritance according to their divisions.",
        "90:16": "But to the tribe at Levi he gave no inheritance, the offerings of the Lord are their inheritance as the Lord had spoken of them by the hand of Moses.",
        "90:17": "And Joshua gave Mount Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephuneh, one portion above his brethren, as the Lord had spoken through Moses.",
        "90:18": "Therefore Hebron became an inheritance to Caleb and his children unto this day.",

        "1:1": "On the third day, God planted the garden in the east of the earth, on\nthe border of the world eastward, beyond which, towards the sun-rising,\none finds nothing but water, that encompasses the whole world, and\nreaches to the borders of heaven.",
        "1:2": "And to the north of the garden there is a sea of water, clear and\npure to the taste, unlike anything else; so that, through the clearness\nthereof, one may look into the depths of the earth.",
        "1:3": "And when a man washes himself in it, he becomes clean of the\ncleanness thereof, and white of its whiteness--even if he were dark.",
        "1:4": "And God created that sea of his own good pleasure, for He knew what\nwould come of the man He would make; so that after he had left the\ngarden, on account of his transgression, men should be born in the\nearth.  Among them are righteous ones who will die, whose souls God\nwould raise at the last day; when all of them will return to their\nflesh, bathe in the water of that sea, and repent of their sins.",
        "1:5": "But when God made Adam go out of the garden, He did not place him on\nthe border of it northward.  This was so that he and Eve would not be\nable to go near to the sea of water where they could wash themselves in\nit, be cleansed from their sins, erase the transgression they had\ncommitted, and be no longer reminded of it in the thought of their\npunishment.",
        "1:6": "As to the southern side of the garden, God did not want Adam to live\nthere either; because, when the wind blew from the north, it would\nbring him, on that southern side, the delicious smell of the trees of\nthe garden.",
        "1:7": "Wherefore God did not put Adam there.  This was so that he would not\nbe able to smell the sweet smell of those trees, forget his\ntransgression, and find consolation for what he had done by taking\ndelight in the smell of the trees and yet not be cleansed from his\ntransgression.",
        "1:8": "Again, also, because God is merciful and of great pity, and governs\nall things in a way that He alone knows--He made our father Adam live\nin the western border of the garden, because on that side the earth is\nvery broad.",
        "1:9": "And God commanded him to live there in a cave in a rock--the Cave of\nTreasures below the garden.",
        "2:1": "But when our father Adam, and Eve, went out of the garden, they\nwalked the ground on their feet, not knowing they were walking.",
        "2:2": "And when they came to the opening of the gate of the garden, and saw\nthe broad earth spread before them, covered with stones large and\nsmall, and with sand, they feared and trembled, and fell on their\nfaces, from the fear that came over them; and they were as dead.",
        "2:3": "Because--whereas until this time they had been in the garden land,\nbeautifully planted with all manner of trees--they now saw themselves,\nin a strange land, which they knew not, and had never seen.",
        "2:4": "And because, when they were in the garden they were filled with the\ngrace of a bright nature, and they had not hearts turned toward earthly\nthings.",
        "2:5": "Therefore God had pity on them; and when He saw them fallen before\nthe gate of the garden, He sent His Word to our father, Adam and Eve,\nand raised them from their fallen state.",
        "3:1": "God said to Adam, \"I have ordained on this earth days and years, and\nyou and your descendants shall live and walk in them, until the days\nand years are fulfilled; when I shall send the Word that created you,\nand against which you have transgressed, the Word that made you come\nout of the garden, and that raised you when you were fallen.",
        "3:2": "Yes, the Word that will again save you when the five and a half days\nare fulfilled.\"",
        "3:3": "But when Adam heard these words from God, and of the great five and a\nhalf days, he did not understand the meaning of them.",
        "3:4": "For Adam was thinking there would be only five and a half days for\nhim until the end of the world.",
        "3:5": "And Adam cried, and prayed to God to explain it to him.",
        "3:6": "Then God in his mercy for Adam who was made after His own image and\nlikeness, explained to him, that these were 5,000 and 500 years; and\nhow One would then come and save him and his descendants.",
        "3:7": "But before that, God had made this covenant with our father, Adam, in\nthe same terms, before he came out of the garden, when he was by the\ntree where Eve took of the fruit and gave it to him to eat.",
        "3:8": "Because, when our father Adam came out of the garden, he passed by\nthat tree, and saw how God had changed the appearance of it into\nanother form, and how it shriveled.",
        "3:9": "And as Adam went to it he feared, trembled and fell down; but God in\nHis mercy lifted him up, and then made this covenant with him.",
        "3:10": "And again, when Adam was by the gate of the garden, and saw the\ncherub with a sword of flashing fire in his hand, and the cherub grew\nangry and frowned at him, both Adam and Eve became afraid of him, and\nthought he meant to put them to death.  So they fell on their faces,\ntrembled with fear.",
        "3:11": "But he had pity on them, and showed them mercy; and turning from\nthem went up to heaven, and prayed to the Lord, and said;--",
        "3:12": "\"Lord, You sent me to watch at the gate of the garden, with a sword\nof fire.",
        "3:13": "But when Your servants, Adam and Eve, saw me, they fell on their\nfaces, and were as dead.  O my Lord, what shall we do to Your servants?\"",
        "3:14": "Then God had pity on them, and showed them mercy, and sent His Angel\nto keep the garden.",
        "3:15": "And the Word of the Lord came to Adam and Eve, and raised them up.",
        "3:16": "And the Lord said to Adam, \"I told you that at the end of the five\nand a half days, I will send my Word and save you.",
        "3:17": "Strengthen your heart, therefore, and stay in the Cave of Treasures,\nof which I have before spoken to you.\"",
        "3:18": "And when Adam heard this Word from God, he was comforted with that\nwhich God had told him.  For He had told him how He would save him.",
        "4:1": "But Adam and Eve cried for having come out of the garden, their first\nhome.",
        "4:2": "And indeed, when Adam looked at his flesh, that was altered, he cried\nbitterly, he and Eve, over what they had done.  And they walked and\nwent gently down into the Cave of Treasures.",
        "4:3": "And as they came to it, Adam cried over himself and said to Eve,\n\"Look at this cave  that is to  be our prison in this world, and a\nplace of punishment!",
        "4:4": "What is it compared with the garden?  What is its narrowness compared\nwith the space of the other?",
        "4:5": "What is this rock, by the side of those groves?  What is the gloom of\nthis cavern, compared with the light of the garden?",
        "4:6": "What is this overhanging ledge of rock to shelter us, compared with\nthe mercy of the Lord that overshadowed us?",
        "4:7": "What is the soil of this cave compared with the garden land?  This\nearth, strewed with stones; and that, planted with delicious fruit\ntrees?\"",
        "4:8": "And Adam said to Eve, \"Look at your eyes, and at mine, which before\nbeheld angels praising in heaven; and they too, without ceasing.",
        "4:9": "But now we do not see as we did; our eyes have become of flesh; they\ncannot see like they used to see before.\"",
        "4:10": "Adam said again to Eve, \"What is our body today, compared to what it\nwas in former days, when we lived in the garden?\"",
        "4:11": "After this, Adam did not want to enter the cave, under the\noverhanging rock; nor would he ever want to enter it.",
        "4:12": "But he bowed to God's orders; and said to himself, \"Unless I enter\nthe cave, I shall again be a transgressor.\"",
        "5:1": "Then Adam and Eve entered the cave, and stood praying, in their own\ntongue, unknown to us, but which they knew well.",
        "5:2": "And as they prayed, Adam raised his eyes and saw the rock and the\nroof of the cave that covered him overhead.  This prevented him from\nseeing either heaven or God's creatures.  So he cried and beat his\nchest hard, until he dropped, and was as dead.",
        "5:3": "And Eve sat crying; for she believed he was dead.",
        "5:4": "Then she got up, spread her hands toward God, appealing to Him for\nmercy and pity, and said, \"O God, forgive me my sin, the sin which I\ncommitted, and don't remember it against me.",
        "5:5": "For I alone caused Your servant to fall from the garden into this\ncondemned land; from light into this darkness; and from the house of\njoy into this prison.",
        "5:6": "O God, look at this Your servant fallen in this manner, and bring him\nback to life, that he may cry and repent of his transgression which he\ncommitted through me.",
        "5:7": "Don't take away his soul right now; but let him live that he may\nstand after the measure of his repentance, and do Your will, as before\nhis death.",
        "5:8": "But if You do not bring him back to life, then, O God, take away my\nown soul, that I be like him, and leave me not in this dungeon, one and\nalone; for I could not stand alone in this world, but with him only.",
        "5:9": "For You, O God, caused him to fall asleep, and took a bone from his\nside, and restored the flesh  in the place of it, by Your divine power.",
        "5:10": "And You took me, the bone, and make me a woman, bright like him,\nwith heart, reason, and speech; and in flesh, like to his own; and You\nmade me after the likeness of his looks, by Your mercy and power.",
        "5:11": "O Lord, I and he are one, and You, O God, are our Creator, You are\nHe who made us both in one day.",
        "5:12": "Therefore, O God, give him life, that he may be with me in this\nstrange land, while we live in it on account of our transgression.",
        "5:13": "But if You will not give him life, then take me, even me, like him;\nthat we both may die the same day.\"",
        "5:14": "And Eve cried bitterly, and fell on our father Adam; from her great\nsorrow.",
        "6:1": "But God looked at them; for they had killed themselves through great\ngrief.",
        "6:2": "But He decided to raise them and comfort them.",
        "6:3": "He, therefore, sent His Word to them; that they should stand and be\nraised immediately.",
        "6:4": "And the Lord said to Adam and Eve, \"You transgressed of your own free\nwill, until you came out of the garden in which I had placed you.",
        "6:5": "Of your own free will have you transgressed through your desire for\ndivinity, greatness, and an exalted state, such as I have; so that I\ndeprived you of the bright nature in which you then were, and I made\nyou come out of the garden to this land, rough and full of trouble.",
        "6:6": "If only you had not transgressed My commandment and had kept My law,\nand had not eaten of the fruit of the tree which I told you not to come\nnear!  And there were fruit trees in the garden better than that one.",
        "6:7": "But the wicked Satan did not keep his faith and had no good intent\ntowards Me, that although I had created him, he considered Me to be\nuseless, and sought the Godhead for himself; for this I hurled him down\nfrom heaven so that he could not remain in his first estate--it was he\nwho made the tree appear pleasant in your eyes, until you ate of it, by\nbelieving his words.",
        "6:8": "Thus have you transgressed My commandment, and therefore I have\nbrought on you all these sorrows.",
        "6:9": "For I am God the Creator, who, when I created My creatures, did not\nintend to destroy them.  But after they had sorely roused My anger, I\npunished them with grievous plagues, until they repent.",
        "6:10": "But, if on the contrary, they still continue hardened in their\ntransgression, they shall be under a curse forever.\"",
        "7:1": "When Adam and Eve heard these words from God, they cried and sobbed\nyet more; but they strengthened their hearts in God, because they now\nfelt that the Lord was to them like a father and a mother; and for this\nvery reason, they cried before Him, and sought mercy from Him.",
        "7:2": "Then God had pity on them, and said: \"O Adam, I have made My covenant\nwith you, and I will not turn from it; neither will I let you return to\nthe garden, until My covenant of the great five and a half days is\nfulfilled.\"",
        "7:3": "Then Adam said to God, \"O Lord, You created us, and made us fit to be\nin the garden; and before I transgressed, You made all beasts come to\nme, that I should name them.",
        "7:4": "Your grace was then on me; and I named every one according to Your\nmind; and you made them all subject to me.",
        "7:5": "But now, O Lord God, that I have transgressed Your commandment, all\nbeasts will rise against me and will devour me, and Eve Your handmaid;\nand will cut off our life from the face of the earth.",

        "7:7": "When the Lord heard these words from Adam, He had pity on him, and\nfelt that he had truly said that the beasts of the field would rise and\ndevour him and Eve, because He, the Lord, was angry with the two of\nthem on account of their transgressions.",
        "7:8": "Then God commanded the beasts, and the birds, and all that moves on\nthe earth, to come to Adam and to be familiar with him, and not to\ntrouble him and Eve; nor yet any of the good and righteous among their\noffspring.",
        "7:9": "Then all the beasts paid homage to Adam, according to the commandment\nof God; except the serpent, against which God was angry.  It did not\ncome to Adam, with the beasts.",
        "8:1": "Then Adam cried and said, \"O God, when we lived in the garden, and\nour hearts were lifted up, we saw the angels that sang praises in\nheaven, but now we can't see like we used to; no, when we entered the\ncave, all creation became hidden from us.\"",
        "8:2": "Then God the Lord said to Adam, \"When you were under subjection to\nMe, you had a bright nature within you, and for that reason could you\nsee things far away.  But after your transgression your bright nature\nwas withdrawn from you; and it was not left to you to see things far\naway, but only near at hand; after the ability of the flesh; for it is\nbrutish.\"",
        "8:3": "When Adam and Eve had heard these words from God, they went their\nway; praising and worshipping Him with a sorrowful heart.",
        "8:4": "And God ceased to commune with them.",
        "9:1": "Then Adam and Eve came out of the Cave of Treasures, and went near to\nthe garden gate, and there they stood to look at it, and cried for\nhaving come away from it.",

        "9:6": "And Eve said to him, \"What is it you have seen that has caused you to\ncry and to speak to me in this manner?\"",
        "9:7": "And he said to Eve, \"Do you not see this water that was with us in\nthe garden, that watered the trees of the garden, and flowed out from\nthere?",
        "9:8": "And we, when we were in the garden, did not care about it; but since\nwe came to this strange land, we love it, and turn it to use for our\nbody.\"",
        "9:9": "But when Eve heard these words from him, she cried; and from the\nsoreness of their crying, they fell into that water; and would have put\nan end to themselves in it, so as never again to return and behold the\ncreation; for when they looked at the work of creation, they felt they\nmust put an end to themselves.",

        "10:7": "When Adam and Eve heard these words from God, they cried a bitter\ncry; and Adam entreated God to let him return into the garden, and look\nat it a second time.",
        "10:8": "But God said to Adam, \"I have made you a promise; when that promise\nis fulfilled, I will bring you back into the garden, you and your\nrighteous descendants.\"",
        "10:9": "And God ceased to commune with Adam.",
        "11:1": "Then Adam and Eve felt themselves burning with thirst, and heat, and\nsorrow.",

        "11:3": "Both Adam and Eve then went away from the water, and drank none of it\nat all; but came and entered the Cave of Treasures.",
        "11:4": "But when in it Adam could not see Eve; he only heard the noise she\nmade.  Neither could she see Adam, but heard the noise he made.",
        "11:5": "Then Adam cried, in deep affliction, and beat his chest; and he got\nup and said to Eve, \"Where are you?\"",

        "11:9": "O Eve!  Remember that while we were in the garden, we knew neither\nnight nor day.  Think of the Tree of Life, from below which flowed the\nwater, and that shed lustre over us!  Remember, O Eve, the garden land,\nand the brightness thereof!",
        "11:10": "Think, oh think of that garden in which was no darkness, while we\nlived in it.",
        "11:11": "Whereas no sooner did we come into this Cave of Treasures than\ndarkness surrounded us all around; until we can no longer see each\nother; and all the pleasure of this life has come to an end.\"",

        "12:6": "And the Word of God came to Adam and raised him from his death, and\nopened Eve's mouth that she might speak.",
        "12:7": "Then Adam stood up in the cave and said, \"O God, why has light\ndeparted from us, and darkness covered us?  Why did you leave us in\nthis long darkness?  Why do you plague us like this?",
        "12:8": "And this darkness, O Lord, where was it before it covered us?  It is\nbecause of this that we cannot see each other.",
        "12:9": "For so long as we were in the garden, we neither saw nor even knew\nwhat darkness is.  I was not hidden from Eve, neither was she hidden\nfrom me, until now that she cannot see me; and no darkness came over us\nto separate us from each other.",
        "12:10": "But she and I were both in one bright light.  I saw her and she saw\nme.  Yet now since we came into this cave, darkness has covered us, and\nseparated us from each other, so that I do not see her, and she does\nnot see me.",

        "13:3": "But when he transgressed My commandment, I deprived him of that\nbright nature, and he became dark.",
        "13:4": "And when he was in the heavens, in the realms of light, he knew\nnothing of darkness.",
        "13:5": "But he transgressed, and I made him fall from the heaven onto the\nearth; and it was this darkness that came over him.",
        "13:6": "And on you, O Adam, while in My garden and obedient to Me, did that\nbright light rest also.",
        "13:7": "But when I heard of your transgression, I deprived you of that bright\nlight.  Yet, of My mercy, I did not turn you into darkness, but I made\nyou your body of flesh, over which I spread this skin, in order that it\nmay bear cold and heat.",
        "13:8": "If I had let My wrath fall heavily on you, I should have destroyed\nyou; and had I turned you into darkness, it would have been as if I had\nkilled you.",
        "13:9": "But in My mercy, I have made you as you are; when you transgressed My\ncommandment, O Adam, I drove you from the garden, and made you come\nforth into this land; and commanded you to live in this cave; and\ndarkness covered you, as it did over him who transgressed My\ncommandment.",
        "13:10": "Thus, O Adam, has this night deceived you.  It is not to last\nforever; but is only of twelve hours; when it is over, daylight will\nreturn.",
        "13:11": "Sigh not, therefore, neither be moved; and say not in your heart\nthat this darkness is long and drags on wearily; and say not in your\nheart that I plague you with it.",
        "13:12": "Strengthen your heart, and be not afraid.  This darkness is not a\npunishment.  But, O Adam, I have made the day, and have placed the sun\nin it to give light; in order that you and your children should do your\nwork.",
        "13:13": "For I knew you would sin and transgress, and come out into this\nland.  Yet I wouldn't force you, nor be heard over you, nor shut up;\nnor doom you through your fall; nor through your coming out from light\ninto darkness; nor yet through your coming from the garden into this\nland.",
        "13:14": "For I made you of the light; and I willed to bring out children of\nlight from you and like to you.",
        "13:15": "But you did not keep My commandment one day; until I had finished\nthe creation and blessed everything in it.",
        "13:16": "Then, concerning the tree, I commanded you not to eat of it.  Yet I\nknew that Satan, who deceived himself, would also deceive you.",
        "13:17": "So I made known to you by means of the tree, not to come near him.\nAnd I told you not to eat of the fruit thereof, nor to taste of it, nor\nyet to sit under it, nor to yield to it.",
        "13:18": "Had I not been and spoken to you, O Adam, concerning the tree, and\nhad I left you without a commandment, and you had sinned--it would have\nbeen an offence on My part, for not having given you any order; you\nwould turn around and blame Me for it.",
        "13:19": "But I commanded you, and warned you, and you fell.  So that My\ncreatures cannot blame Me; but the blame rests on them alone.",
        "13:20": "And, O Adam, I have made the day so that you and your descendants\ncan work and toil in it.  And I have made the night for them to rest in\nit from their work; and for the beasts of the field to go forth by\nnight and look for their food.",
        "13:21": "But little of darkness now remains, O Adam, and daylight will soon\nappear.\"",
        "14:1": "Then Adam said to God: \"O Lord, take You my soul, and let me not see\nthis gloom any more; or remove me to some place where there is no\ndarkness.\"",
        "14:2": "But God the Lord said to Adam, \"Indeed I say to you, this darkness\nwill pass from you, every day I have determined for you, until the\nfulfillment of My covenant; when I will save you and bring you back\nagain into the garden, into the house of light you long for, in which\nthere is no darkness.  I will bring you to it--in the kingdom of\nheaven.\"",
        "14:3": "Again said God to Adam, \"All this misery that you have been made to\ntake on yourself because of your transgression, will not free you from\nthe hand of Satan, and will not save you.",
        "14:4": "But I will.  When I shall come down from heaven, and shall become\nflesh of your descendants, and take on Myself the infirmity from which\nyou suffer, then the darkness that covered you in this cave shall cover\nMe in the grave, when I am in the flesh of your descendants.",
        "14:5": "And I, who am without years, shall be subject to the reckoning of\nyears, of times, of months, and of days, and I shall be reckoned as one\nof the sons of men, in order to save you.\"",
        "14:6": "And God ceased to commune with Adam.",
        "15:1": "Then Adam and Eve cried and sorrowed by reason of God's word to them,\nthat they should not return to the garden until the fulfillment of the\ndays decreed on them; but mostly because God had told them that He\nshould suffer for their salvation.",
        "16:1": "After this, Adam and Eve continued to stand in the cave, praying and\ncrying, until the morning dawned on them.",
        "16:2": "And when they saw the light returned to them, they retrained from\nfear, and strengthened their hearts.",
        "16:3": "Then Adam began to come out of the cave.  And when he came to the\nmouth of it, and stood and turned his face towards the east, and saw\nthe sunrise in glowing rays, and felt the heat thereof on his body, he\nwas afraid of it, and thought in his heart that this flame came forth\nto plague him.",
        "16:4": "He then cried and beat his chest, then he fell on the ground on his\nface and made his request, saying:--",
        "16:5": "\"O Lord, plague me not, neither consume me, nor yet take away my life\nfrom the earth.\"",
        "16:6": "For he thought the sun was God.",
        "16:7": "Because while he was in the garden and heard the voice of God and the\nsound He made in the garden, and feared Him, Adam never saw the\nbrilliant light of the sun, neither did its flaming heat touch his body.",
        "16:8": "Therefore he was afraid of the sun when flaming rays of it reached\nhim.  He thought God meant to plague him therewith all the days He had\ndecreed for him.",
        "16:9": "For Adam also said in his thoughts, as God did not plague us with\ndarkness, behold, He has caused this sun to rise and to plague us with\nburning heat.",
        "16:10": "But while he was thinking like this in his heart, the Word of God\ncame to him and said:--",
        "16:11": "\"O Adam, get up on your feet.  This sun is not God; but it has been\ncreated to give light by day, of which I spoke to you in the cave\nsaying, 'that the dawn would come, and there would be light by day.'",
        "16:12": "But I am God who comforted you in the night.\"",
        "16:13": "And God ceased to commune with Adam.",
        "17:1": "The Adam and Eve came out at the mouth of the cave, and went towards\nthe garden.",
        "17:2": "But as they went near it, before the western gate, from which Satan\ncame when he deceived Adam and Eve, they found the serpent that became\nSatan coming at the gate, and sorrowfully licking the dust, and\nwiggling on its breast on the ground, by reason of the curse that fell\non it from God.",
        "17:3": "And whereas before the serpent was the most exalted of all beasts,\nnow it was changed and become slippery, and the meanest of them all,\nand it crept on its breast and went on its belly.",
        "17:4": "And whereas it was the fairest of all beasts, it had been changed,\nand was become the ugliest of them all.  Instead of feeding on the best\nfood, now it turned to eat the dust.  Instead of living, as before, in\nthe best places, now it lived in the dust.",
        "17:5": "And, whereas it had been the most beautiful of all beasts, all of\nwhich stood dumb at its beauty, it was now abhorred of them.",
        "17:6": "And, again, whereas it lived in one beautiful home, to which all\nother animals came from elsewhere; and where it drank, they drank also\nof the same; now, after it had become venomous, by reason of God's\ncurse, all beasts fled from its home, and would not drink of the water\nit drank; but fled from it.",
        "18:1": "When the accursed serpent saw Adam and Eve, it swelled its head,\nstood on its tail, and with eyes blood-red, acted like it would kill\nthem.",
        "18:2": "It made straight for Eve, and ran after her; while Adam standing by,\ncried because he had no stick in his hand with which to hit the\nserpent, and did not know how to put it to death.",
        "18:3": "But with a heart burning for Eve, Adam approached the serpent, and\nheld it by the tail; when it turned towards him and said to him:--",
        "18:4": "\"O Adam, because of you and of Eve, I am slippery, and go on my\nbelly.\"  Then with its great strength, it threw down Adam and Eve and\nsqueezed them, and tried to kill them.",
        "18:5": "But God sent an angel who threw the serpent away from them, and\nraised them up.",
        "18:6": "Then the Word of God came to the serpent, and said to it, \"The first\ntime I made you slick, and made you to go on your belly; but I did not\ndeprive you of speech.",

        "18:8": "Then the serpent was struck mute, and was no longer able to speak.",
        "18:9": "And a wind blew down from heaven by the command of God and carried\naway the serpent from Adam and Eve, and threw it on the seashore where\nit landed in India.",
        "19:1": "But Adam and Eve cried before God.  And Adam said to Him:--",
        "19:2": "\"O Lord, when I was in the cave, I said this to you, my Lord, the\nbeasts of the field would rise and devour me, and cut off my life from\nthe earth.\"",
        "19:3": "Then Adam, because of what had happened to him, beat his chest and\nfell on the ground like a corpse.  Then the Word of God came to him,\nwho raised him, and said to him,",
        "19:4": "\"O Adam, not one of these beasts will be able to hurt you; because I\nhave made the beasts and other moving things come to you in the cave.\nI did not let the serpent come with them because it might have risen\nagainst you and made you tremble; and the fear of it should fall into\nyour hearts.",
        "19:5": "For I knew that the accursed one is wicked; therefore I would not let\nit come near you with the other beasts.",

        "20:2": "But God said to Adam and Eve, \"From now on, don't be afraid, I will\nnot let it come near you; I have driven it away from you, from this\nmountain; neither will I leave in it the ability to hurt you.\"",
        "20:3": "Then Adam and Eve worshipped before God and gave Him thanks, and\npraised Him for having delivered them from death.",

        "22:5": "And Adam cried and said, \"O Lord, do not cut me off for this, neither\npunish me with heavy plagues, nor yet repay me according to my sin; for\nwe, of our own will, transgressed Your commandment, and ignored Your\nlaw, and tried to become gods like you, when Satan the enemy deceived\nus.\"",
        "22:6": "Then God said again to Adam, \"Because you have endured fear and\ntrembling in this land, languor and suffering, treading and walking\nabout, going on this mountain, and dying from it, I will take all this\non Myself in order to save you.\"",
        "23:1": "Then Adam cried more and said, \"O God, have mercy on me, so far as to\ntake on yourself, that which I will do.\"",
        "23:2": "But God withdrew His Word from Adam and Eve.",

        "23:4": "Then Adam and Eve took stones and placed them in the shape of an\naltar; and they took leaves from the trees outside the garden, with\nwhich they wiped, from the face of the rock, the blood they had spilled.",
        "23:5": "But that which had dropped on the sand, they took together with the\ndust with which it was mingled and offered it on the altar as an\noffering to God.",
        "23:6": "Then Adam and Eve stood under the Altar and cried, thus praying to\nGod, \"Forgive us our trespass and our sin, and look at us with Thine\neye of mercy.  For when we were in the garden our praises and our hymns\nwent up before you without ceasing.",
        "23:7": "But when we came into this strange land, pure praise was not longer\nours, nor righteous prayer, nor understanding hearts, nor sweet\nthoughts, nor just counsels, nor long discernment, nor upright\nfeelings, neither is our bright nature left us.  But our body is\nchanged from the likeness in which it was at first, when we were\ncreated.",

        "23:9": "And Adam began to make more requests of God.",
        "24:1": "Then the merciful God, good and lover of men, looked at Adam and Eve,\nand at their blood, which they had held up as an offering to Him;\nwithout an order from Him for so doing.  But He wondered at them; and\naccepted their offerings.",
        "24:2": "And God sent from His presence a bright fire, that consumed their\noffering.",
        "24:3": "He smelled the sweet savor of their offering, and showed them mercy.",
        "24:4": "Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said to him, \"O Adam, as you\nhave shed your blood, so will I shed My own blood when I become flesh\nof your descendants; and as you died, O Adam, so also will I die.

        "26:7": "Then God looked at Adam and Eve and at their great sorrow, and at all\nthey had done with a fervent heart, on account of all the trouble they\nwere in, instead of their former well-being, and on account of all the\nmisery that came over them in a strange land.",
        "26:8": "Therefore God was not angry with them; nor impatient with them; but\nhe was patient and forbearing towards them, as towards the children He\nhad created.",
        "26:9": "Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said to him, \"Adam, as for the\nsun, if I were to take it and bring it to you, days, hours, years and\nmonths would all stop, and the covenant I have made with you, would\nnever be fulfilled.",

        "26:16": "And God said again to Adam, \"Be patient and enter the cave, for the\ndarkness, of which you were afraid, shall only be twelve hours long;\nand when ended, light shall come up.\"",
        "26:17": "Then when Adam heard these words from God, he and Eve worshipped\nbefore Him, and their hearts were comforted.  They returned into the\ncave after their custom, while tears flowed from their eyes, sorrow and\nwailing came from their hearts, and they wished their soul would leave\ntheir body.",

        "27:4": "And Satan did this, in order that when Adam saw the light, he should\nthink within himself that it was a heavenly light, and that Satan's\nhosts were angels; and that God had sent them to watch at the cave, and\nto give him light in the darkness.",
        "27:5": "So that when Adam came out of the cave and saw them, and Adam and Eve\nbowed to Satan, then he would overcome Adam thereby, and a second time\nhumble him before God.",

        "27:7": "\"Look at that great light, and at those many songs of praise, and at\nthat host standing outside who won't come into our cave.  Why don't\nthey tell us what they want, where they are from, what the meaning of\nthis light is, what those praises are, why they have been sent to this\nplace, and why they won't come in?",
        "27:8": "If they were from God, they would come into the cave with us, and\nwould tell us why they were sent.\"",

        "27:11": "But, look, we see these hosts that stand at the mouth of the cave;\nthey are in a great light; they sing loud praises.  If they are of some\nother god than You, tell me; and if they are sent by you, inform me of\nthe reason for which You have sent them.\"",
        "27:12": "No sooner had Adam said this, than an angel from God appeared to him\nin the cave, who said to him, \"O Adam, fear not.  This is Satan and his\nhosts; he wishes to deceive you as he deceived you at first.  For the\nfirst time, he was hidden in the serpent; but this time he is come to\nyou in the likeness of an angel of light; in order that, when you\nworshipped him, he might enslave you, in the very presence of God.\"",
        "27:13": "Then the angel went from Adam and seized Satan at the opening of the\ncave, and stripped him of the pretense he had assumed, and brought him\nin his own hideous form to Adam and Eve; who were afraid of him when\nthey saw him.",
        "27:14": "And the angel said to Adam, \"This hideous form has been his ever\nsince God made him fall from heaven.  He could not have come near you\nin it; he therefore transformed himself into an angel of light.\"",
        "27:15": "Then the angel drove away Satan and his hosts from Adam and Eve, and\nsaid to them, \"Fear not; God who created you, will strengthen you.\"",
        "27:16": "And the angel left them.",

        "27:18": "And when it was morning they prayed; and then went out to seek the\ngarden.  For their hearts were towards it, and they could get no\nconsolation for having left it.",
        "28:1": "But when the crafty Satan saw them, that they were going to the\ngarden, he gathered together his host, and came in appearance on a\ncloud, intent on deceiving them.",
        "28:2": "But when Adam and Eve saw him thus in a vision, they thought they\nwere angels of God come to comfort them about having left the garden,\nor to bring them back again into it.",
        "28:3": "And Adam spread his hands before God, beseeching Him to make him\nunderstand what they were.",
        "28:4": "Then Satan, the hater of all good, said to Adam, \"O Adam, I am an\nangel of the great God; and, behold the hosts that surround me.",
        "28:5": "God has sent us to take you and bring you to the border of the garden\nnorthwards; to the shore of the clear sea, and bathe you and Eve in it,\nand raise you to your former gladness, that you return again to the\ngarden.\"",
        "28:6": "These words sank into the heart of Adam and Eve.",

        "28:8": "Then Satan called to Adam and Eve, and said, \"Behold, we go to the\nsea of water,\" and they began to go.",
        "28:9": "And Adam and Eve followed them at some little distance.",
        "28:10": "But when they came to the mountain to the north of the garden, a\nvery high mountain, without any steps to the top of it, the Devil drew\nnear to Adam and Eve, and made them go up to the top in reality, and\nnot in a vision; wishing, as he did, to throw them down and kill them,\nand to wipe off their name from the earth; so that this earth should\nremain to him and his hosts alone.",
        "29:1": "But when the merciful God saw that Satan wished to kill Adam with his\nmany tricks, and saw that Adam was meek and without guile, God spoke to\nSatan in a loud voice, and cursed him.",
        "29:2": "Then he and his hosts fled, and Adam and Eve remained standing on the\ntop of the mountain, from there they saw below them the wide world,\nhigh above which they were.  But they saw none of the host which time\nafter time were by them.",
        "29:3": "They cried, both Adam and Eve, before God, and begged for forgiveness\nof Him.",
        "29:4": "Then came the Word from God to Adam, and said to him, \"Know you and\nunderstand concerning this Satan, that he seeks to deceive you and your\ndescendants after you.\"",
        "29:5": "And Adam cried before the Lord God, and begged and prayed to Him to\ngive him something from the garden, as a token to him, wherein to be\ncomforted.",

        "30:10": "And when Adam saw the golden rods, the incense and the myrrh, he was\nrejoiced and cried because he thought that the gold was a token of the\nkingdom from where he had come, that the incense was a token of the\nbright light which had been taken from him, and that the myrrh was a\ntoken of the sorrow in which he was.",

        "34:9": "O God, You made them obedient to me, and ordered that not one of them\nbreak from my sway, according to Your commandment, and to the dominion\nwhich You had given me over them.  But now they are all estranged from\nme.",
        "34:10": "Then it was in that third hour of Friday, in which You created me,\nand commanded me concerning the tree, to which I was neither to go\nnear, nor to eat thereof; for You said to me in the garden, 'When you\neat of it, of death you shall die.'",
        "34:11": "And if You had punished me as You said, with death, I should have\ndied that very moment.",
        "34:12": "Moreover, when You commanded me regarding the tree, I was neither to\napproach nor to eat thereof, Eve was not with me; You had not yet\ncreated her, neither had You yet taken her out of my side; nor had she\nyet heard this order from you.",

        "34:15": "It was of Your good will, O God, that You brought a slumber in a\nsleep over me, and that You immediately brought Eve out of my side,\nuntil she was out, so that I did not see how she was made; neither\ncould I witness, O my Lord, how awful and great are Your goodness and\nglory.",
        "34:16": "And of Your goodwill, O Lord, You made us both with bodies of a\nbright nature, and You made us two, one; and You gave us Your grace,\nand filled us with praises of the Holy Spirit; that we should be\nneither hungry nor thirsty, nor know what sorrow is, nor yet faintness\nof heart; neither suffering, fasting nor weariness.",

        "39:2": "Then Adam and Eve took each a fig and went towards the cave; the time\nwas about the setting of the sun; and their thoughts made them long to\neat of the fruit.",
        "39:3": "But Adam said to Eve, \"I am afraid to eat of this fig.  I know not\nwhat may come over me from it.\"",
        "39:4": "So Adam cried, and stood praying before God, saying, \"Satisfy my\nhunger, without my having to eat this fig; for after I have eaten it,\nwhat will it profit me?  And what shall I desire and ask of you, O God,\nwhen it is gone?\"",
        "39:5": "And he said again, \"I am afraid to eat of it; for I know not what\nwill befall me through it.\"",

        "40:3": "And God withdrew His Word for Adam.",

        "41:2": "And the weight of each fig was that of a water-melon; for the fruit\nof the garden was much larger than the fruit of this land.",
        "41:3": "But Adam and Eve remained standing and fasting the whole of that\nnight, until the morning dawned.",
        "41:4": "When the sun rose they were still praying, but after they had\nfinished praying, Adam said to Eve:--",

        "41:6": "For God has not fed us with the Tree of Life, in order that we may\nnot live.  Therefore, we will ask him to give us some of the Water of\nLife, and to quench our thirst with it, rather than with a drink of\nwater of this land.\"",
        "41:7": "When Eve heard these words from Adam, she agreed; and they both got\nup and came to the southern border of the garden, at the edge of the\nriver of water a short distance from the garden.",
        "41:8": "And they stood and prayed before the Lord, and asked Him to look at\nthem this once, to forgive them, and to grant them their request.",
        "41:9": "After this prayer from both of them, Adam began to pray with his\nvoice before God, and said;--",
        "41:10": "\"O Lord, when I was in the garden and saw the water that flowed from\nunder the Tree of Life, my heart did not desire, neither did my body\nrequire to drink of it; neither did I know thirst, for I was living;\nand above that which I am now.",
        "41:11": "So that in order to live I did not require any Food of Life, neither\ndid I drink of the Water of Life.",
        "41:12": "But now, O God, I am dead; my flesh is parched with thirst.  Give me\nof the Water of Life that I may drink of it and live.",
        "41:13": "Of Your mercy, O God, save me from these plagues and trials, and\nbring me into another land different from this, if You will not let me\nlive in Your garden.\"",
        "42:1": "Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said to him:--",
        "42:2": "\"O Adam, as to what you said, 'Bring me into a land where there is\nrest,' it is not another land than this, but it is the kingdom of\nheaven where alone there is rest.",
        "42:3": "But you can not make your entrance into it at present; but only after\nyour judgment is past and fulfilled.",
        "42:4": "Then will I make you go up into the kingdom of heaven, you and your\nrighteous descendants; and I will give you and them the rest you ask\nfor at present.",

        "42:8": "For My blood shall be the Water of Life to you at that time, and not\nto just you alone, but to all your descendants who shall believe in\nMe; that it be to them for rest forever.\"",
        "42:9": "The Lord said again to Adam, \"O Adam, when you were in the garden,\nthese trials did not come to you.",
        "42:10": "But since you transgressed My commandment, all these sufferings have\ncome over you.",
        "42:11": "Now, also, does your flesh require food and drink; drink then of\nthat water that flows by you on the face of the earth.",

        "42:13": "And Adam and Eve worshipped the Lord, and returned from the river of\nwater to the cave.  It was noon-day; and when they drew near to the\ncave, they saw a large fire by it.",
        "43:1": "Then Adam and Eve were afraid, and stood still.  And Adam said to\nEve, \"What is that fire by our cave?  We have done nothing in it to\ncause this fire.",

        "43:3": "But ever since God sent the cherub with a sword of fire that flashed\nand lightened in his hand, from fear of which we fell down and were\nlike corpses, have we not seen the like.",
        "43:4": "But now, O Eve, behold, this is the same fire that was in the\ncherub's hand, which God has sent to keep the cave in which we live.",
        "43:5": "O Eve, it is because God is angry with us, and will drive us from it.",
        "43:6": "O Eve, we have again transgressed His commandment in that cave, so\nthat He had sent this fire to burn around it, and to prevent us from\ngoing into it.",
        "43:7": "If this be really so, O Eve, where shall we live?  And where shall we\nflee from before the face of the Lord?  Since, in regards to the\ngarden, He will not let us live in it, and He has deprived us of the\ngood things thereof; but He has placed us in this cave, in which we\nhave borne darkness, trials and hardships, until at last we have found\ncomfort therein.",
        "43:8": "But now that He has brought us out into another land, who knows what\nmay happen in it?  And who knows but that the darkness of that land may\nbe far greater than the darkness of this land?",
        "43:9": "Who knows what may happen in that land by day or by night? And who\nknows whether it will be far or near, O Eve?  Where it will please God\nto put us, may be far from the garden, O Eve?  Or where God will\nprevent us from beholding Him, because we have transgressed His\ncommandment, and because we have made requests of Him at all times?",
        "43:10": "O Eve, if God will bring us into a strange land other than this, in\nwhich we find consolation, it must be to put our souls to death, and\nblot out our name from the face of the earth.",
        "43:11": "O Eve, if we are further alienated from the garden and from God,\nwhere shall we find Him again, and ask Him to give us gold, incense,\nmyrrh, and some fruit of the fig-tree?",
        "43:12": "Where shall we find Him, to comfort us a second time?  Where shall\nwe find Him, that He may think of us, as regards the covenant He has\nmade on our behalf?\"",
        "43:13": "Then Adam said no more. And they kept looking, He and Eve, towards\nthe cave, and at the fire that flared up around it.",
        "43:14": "But that fire was from Satan.  For he had gathered trees and dry\ngrasses, and had carried and brought them to the cave, and had set fire\nto them, in order to consume the cave and what was in it.",
        "43:15": "So that Adam and Eve should be left in sorrow, and he should cut off\ntheir trust in God, and make them deny Him.",
        "43:16": "But by the mercy of God he could not burn the cave, for God sent His\nangel around the cave to guard it from such a fire, until it went out.",
        "43:17": "And this fire lasted from noon-day until the break of day.  That was\nthe forty-fifth day.",
        "44:1": "Yet Adam and Eve were standing and looking at the fire, and unable to\ncome near the cave from their dread of the fire.",
        "44:2": "And Satan kept on bringing trees and throwing them into the fire,\nuntil the flames of the fire rose up on high, and covered the whole\ncave, thinking, as he did in his own mind, to consume the cave with\nmuch fire.  But the angel of the Lord was guarding it.",
        "44:3": "And yet he could not curse Satan, nor injure him by word, because he\nhad no authority over him, neither did he take to doing so with words\nfrom his mouth.",
        "44:4": "Therefore the angel tolerated him, without saying one bad word, until\nthe Word of God came who said to Satan, \"Go away from here; once before\nyou deceived My servants, and this time you seek to destroy them.",

        "44:6": "Then Satan fled from before the Lord.  But the fire went on burning\naround the cave like a coal-fire the whole day; which was the\nforty-sixth day Adam and Eve had spent since they came out of the\ngarden.",
        "44:7": "And when Adam and Eve saw that the heat of the fire had somewhat\ncooled down, they began to walk towards the cave to get into it as they\nusually did; but they could not, by reason of the heat of the fire.",
        "44:8": "Then they both began crying because of the fire that separated them\nfrom the cave, and that came towards them, burning.  And they were\nafraid.",
        "44:9": "Then Adam said to Eve, \"See this fire of which we have a portion in\nus:  which formerly yielded to us, but no longer does so, now that we\nhave transgressed the limit of creation, and changed our condition, and\nour nature is altered.  But the fire is not changed in its nature, nor\naltered from its creation.  Therefore it now has power over us; and\nwhen we come near it, it scorches our flesh.\"",
        "45:1": "Then Adam rose and prayed to God, saying, \"See, this fire has\nseparated us from the cave in which You have commanded us to live; but\nnow, behold, we cannot go into it.\"",
        "45:2": "Then God heard Adam, and sent him His Word, that said:--",
        "45:3": "\"O Adam, see this fire!  How different the flame and heat thereof are\nfrom the garden of delights and the good things in it!",
        "45:4": "When you were under My control, all creatures yielded to you; but\nafter you have transgressed My commandment, they all rise over you.\"",
        "45:5": "God said again to him, \"See, O Adam, how Satan has exalted you!  He\nhas deprived you of the Godhead, and of an exalted state like Me, and\nhas not kept his word to you; but has, after all, become your enemy.\nHe is the one who made this fire in which he meant to burn you and Eve.",
        "45:6": "Why, O Adam, has he not kept his agreement with you, not even one\nday; but has deprived you of the glory that was on you--when you\nyielded to his command?",
        "45:7": "Do you think, Adam, that he loved you when he made this agreement\nwith you?  Or that he loved you and wished to raise you on high?",
        "45:8": "But no, Adam, he did not do all that out of love to you; but he\nwished to make you come out of light into darkness; and from an exalted\nstate to degradation; from glory to abasement; from joy to sorrow; and\nfrom rest to fasting and fainting.\"",
        "45:9": "God also said to Adam, \"See this fire kindled by Satan around your\ncave; see this wonder that surrounds you; and know that it will\nencompass about both you and your descendants, when you obey his\ncommand; that he will plague you with fire; and that you will go down\ninto hell after you are dead.",
        "45:10": "Then you will see the burning of his fire, that will be burning\naround you and likewise your descendants.  You will not be delivered\nfrom it until My coming; just like you cannot go into your cave right\nnow because of the great fire around it; not until My Word comes and\nmakes a way for you on the day My covenant is fulfilled.",
        "45:11": "There is no way for you at present to come from this life to rest,\nnot until My Word comes, who is My Word.  Then He will make a way for\nyou, and you shall have rest.\" Then God called with His Word to the\nfire that burned around the cave, that it split itself in half, until\nAdam had gone through it.  Then the fire parted itself by God's order,\nand a way was made for Adam.",
        "45:12": "And God withdrew His Word from Adam.",
        "46:1": "Then Adam and Eve began again to come into the cave.  And when they\ncame to the way between the fire, Satan blew into the fire like a\nwhirlwind, and caused the burning coal-fire to cover Adam and Eve; so\nthat their bodies were singed; and the coal-fire scorched them.",
        "46:2": "And from the burning of the fire Adam and Eve screamed, and said, \"O\nLord, save us!  Leave us not to be consumed and plagued by this burning\nfire; neither require us for having transgressed Your commandment.\"",
        "46:3": "Then God looked at their bodies, on which Satan had caused fire to\nburn, and God sent His angel that stayed the burning fire.  But the\nwounds remained on their bodies.",
        "46:4": "And God said to Adam, \"See Satan's love for you, who pretended to\ngive you the Godhead and greatness; and, behold, he burns you with\nfire, and seeks to destroy you from off the earth.",
        "46:5": "Then look at Me, O Adam; I created you, and how many times have I\ndelivered you out of his hand?  If not, wouldn't  he have destroyed\nyou?\"",
        "46:6": "God said again to Eve, \"What is that he promised you in the garden,\nsaying, 'As soon as you eat from the tree, your eyes will be opened,\nand you shall become like gods, knowing good and evil.'  But look!  He\nhas burnt your bodies with fire, and has made you taste the taste of\nfire, for the taste of the garden; and has made you see the burning of\nfire, and the evil of it, and the power it has over you.",
        "46:7": "Your eyes have seen the good he has taken from you, and in truth he\nhas opened your eyes; and you have seen the garden in which you were\nwith Me, and you have also seen the evil that has come over you from\nSatan.  But as to the Godhead he cannot give it to you, neither fulfil\nhis speech to you.  No, he was bitter against you and your descendants,\nthat will come after you.\"",
        "46:8": "And God withdrew His Word form them.",
        "47:1": "Then Adam and Eve came into the cave, yet trembling at the fire that\nhad scorched their bodies.  So Adam said to Eve:--",
        "47:2": "\"Look, the fire has burnt our flesh in this world; but how will it be\nwhen we are dead, and Satan shall punish our souls?  Is not our\ndeliverance long and far off, unless God come, and in mercy to us\nfulfil His promise?\"",

        "47:4": "But as the sun was setting the fire was still burning and nearing\nAdam and Eve in the cave, so that they could not sleep in it.  After\nthe sun had set, they went out of it.  This was the forty-seventh day\nafter they came out of the garden.",
        "47:5": "Adam and Eve then came under the top of hill by the garden to sleep,\nas they were accustomed.",
        "47:6": "And they stood and prayed God to forgive them their sins, and then\nfell asleep under the summit of the mountain.",
        "47:7": "But Satan, the hater of all good, thought within himself: \"Whereas\nGod has promised salvation to Adam by covenant, and that He would\ndeliver him out of all the hardships that have befallen him--but has\nnot promised me by covenant, and will not deliver me out of my\nhardships; no, since He has promised him that He should make him and\nhis descendants live in the kingdom in which I once was--I will kill\nAdam.",
        "47:8": "The earth shall be rid of him; and shall be left to me alone; so that\nwhen he is dead he may not have any descendants left to inherit the\nkingdom that shall remain my own realm; God will then be wanting me,\nand He will restore it to me and my hosts.\"",
        "48:1": "After this Satan called to his hosts, all of which came to him, and\nsaid to him:--",
        "48:2": "\"O, our lord, what will you do?\"",
        "48:3": "He then said to them, \"You know that this Adam, whom God created out\nof the dust, is the one who has taken our kingdom, come, let us gather\ntogether and kill him; or hurl a rock at him and at Eve, and crush them\nunder it.\"",
        "48:4": "When Satan's hosts heard these words, they came to the part of the\nmountain where Adam and Eve were asleep.",
        "48:5": "Then Satan and his host took a huge rock, broad and even, and without\nblemish, thinking within himself, \"If there should be a hole in the\nrock, when it fell on them, the hole in the rock might come over them,\nand so they would escape and not die.\"",
        "48:6": "He then said to his hosts, \"Take up this stone, and throw it flat on\nthem, so that it doesn't roll off them to somewhere else.  And when you\nhave hurled it, get away from there quickly.\"",
        "48:7": "And they did as he told them.  But as the rock fell down from the\nmountain toward Adam and Eve, God commanded the rock to become a dome\nover them, that did them no harm.  And so it was by God's order.",
        "48:8": "But when the rock fell, the whole earth quaked with it, and was\nshaken from the size of the rock.",

        "48:12": "He is angry with us for our having come out of the cave, without His\norder; and for our having done so of our own accord, without consulting\nHim, when we left the cave and came to this place.\"",
        "48:13": "Then Eve said, \"If, indeed, the earth quaked for our sake, and this\nrock forms a tent over us because of our transgression, then we will be\nsorry, O Adam, because our punishment will be long.",

        "49:13": "But, after three days and three nights, God created an opening in\nthe dome of rock and allowed them to get out from under it.  Their\nflesh was dried up, and their eyes and hearts were troubled from crying\nand sorrow.",

        "52:4": "And they thought how they could make garments of those skins; for\nthey had no skill for it.",
        "52:5": "Then God sent to them His angel to show them how to work it out.  And\nthe angel said to Adam, \"Go forth, and bring some palm-thorns.\"  Then\nAdam went out, and brought some, as the angel had commanded him.",
        "52:6": "Then the angel began before them to work out the skins, after the\nmanner of one who prepares a shirt.  And he took the thorns and stuck\nthem into the skins, before their eyes.",
        "52:7": "Then the angel again stood up and prayed God that the thorns in those\nskins should be hidden, so as to be, as it were, sewn with one thread.",
        "52:8": "And so it was, by God's order; they became garments for Adam and Eve,\nand He clothed them therewith.",
        "52:9": "From that time the nakedness of their bodies was covered from the\nsight of each other's eyes.",
        "52:10": "And this happened at the end of the fifty-first day.",
        "52:11": "Then when Adam's and Eve's bodies were covered, they stood and\nprayed, and sought mercy of the Lord, and forgiveness, and gave Him\nthanks for that He had had mercy on them, and had covered their\nnakedness.  And they ceased not from prayer the whole of that night.",
        "52:12": "Then when the morning dawned at the rising of the sun, they said\ntheir prayers after their custom; and then went out of the cave.",
        "52:13": "And Adam said to Eve, \"Since we don't know what there is to the west\nof this cave, let us go out and see it today.\" Then they came forth and\nwent toward the western border.",
        "53:1": "They were not very far from the cave, when Satan came towards them,\nand hid himself between them and the cave, under the form of two\nravenous lions three days without food, that came towards Adam and Eve,\nas if to break them in pieces and devour them.",
        "53:2": "Then Adam and Eve cried, and prayed God to deliver them from their\npaws.",
        "53:3": "Then the Word of God came to them, and drove away the lions from them.",
        "53:4": "And God said to Adam, \"O Adam, what do you seek on the western\nborder?  And why have you left of thine own accord the eastern border,\nin which was your living place?",
        "53:5": "Now then, turn back to your cave, and remain in it, so that Satan\nwon't deceive you or work his purpose over you.",
        "53:6": "For in this western border, O Adam, there will go from you a\ndescendant, that shall replenish it; and that will defile themselves\nwith their sins, and with their yielding to the commands of Satan, and\nby following his works.",
        "53:7": "Therefore will I bring over them the waters of a flood, and overwhelm\nthem all.  But I will deliver what is left of the righteous among them;\nand I will bring them to a distant land, and the land in which you live\nnow shall remain desolate and without one inhabitant in it.",
        "53:8": "After God had thus spoken to them, they went back to the Cave of\nTreasures.  But their flesh was dried up, and they were weak from\nfasting and praying, and from the sorrow they felt at having trespassed\nagainst God.",
        "54:1": "Then Adam and Eve stood up in the cave and prayed the whole of that\nnight until the morning dawned.  And when the sun was risen they both\nwent out of the cave; their heads were wandering from heaviness of\nsorrow and they didn't know where they were going.",
        "54:2": "And they walked in that condition to the southern border of the\ngarden.  And they began to go up that border until they came to the\neastern border beyond which there was no more land.",
        "54:3": "And the cherub who guarded the garden was standing at the western\ngate, and guarding it against Adam and Eve, lest they should suddenly\ncome into the garden.  And the cherub turned around, as if to put them\nto death; according to the commandment God had given him.",
        "54:4": "When Adam and Eve came to the eastern border of the garden--thinking\nin their hearts that the cherub was not watching--as they were standing\nby the gate as if wishing to go in, suddenly came the cherub with a\nflashing sword of fire in his hand; and when he saw them, he went forth\nto kill them.  For he was afraid that God would destroy him if they\nwent into the garden without His order.",
        "54:5": "And the sword of the cherub seemed to shoot flames a distance away\nfrom it.  But when he raised it over Adam and Eve, the flame of the\nsword did not flash forth.",
        "54:6": "Therefore the cherub thought that God was favorable to them, and was\nbringing them back into the garden.  And the cherub stood wondering.",
        "54:7": "He could not go up to Heaven to determine God's order regarding their\ngetting into the garden; he therefore continued to stand by them,\nunable as he was to part from them; for he was afraid that if  they\nshould enter the garden without permission, God would destroy him.",
        "54:8": "When Adam and Eve saw the cherub coming towards them with a flaming\nsword of fire in his hand, they fell on their faces from fear, and were\nas dead.",
        "54:9": "At that time the heavens and the earth shook; and another cherubim\ncame down from heaven to the cherub who guarded the garden, and saw him\namazed and silent.",
        "54:10": "Then, again, other angels came down close to the place where Adam\nand Eve were.  They were divided between joy and sorrow.",
        "54:11": "They were glad, because they thought that God was favorable to Adam,\nand wished him to return to the garden; and wished to restore him to\nthe gladness he once enjoyed.",
        "54:12": "But they sorrowed over Adam, because he was fallen like a dead man,\nhe and Eve; and they said in their thoughts, \"Adam has not died in this\nplace; but God has put him to death, for his having come to this place,\nand wishing to get into the garden without His permission.\"",
        "55:1": "Then came the Word of God to Adam and Eve, and raised them from their\ndead state, saying to them, \"Why did you come up here?  Do you intend\nto go into the garden, from which I brought you out?  It cannot be\ntoday; but only when the covenant I have made with you is fulfilled.\"",
        "55:2": "Then Adam, when he heard the Word of God, and the fluttering of the\nangels whom he did not see, but only heard the sound of them with his\nears, he and Eve cried, and said to the angels:--",
        "55:3": "\"O Spirits, who wait on God, look at me, and at my being unable to\nsee you!  For when I was in my former bright nature, then I could see\nyou.  I sang praises as you do; and my heart was far above you.",
        "55:4": "But now, that I have transgressed, that bright nature is gone from\nme, and I am come to this miserable state.  And now I have come to\nthis, that I cannot see you, and you do not serve me like you used to\ndo.  For I have become animal flesh.",
        "55:5": "Yet now, O angels of God, ask God with me, to restore me to that\nwherein I was formerly; to rescue me from this misery, and to remove\nfrom me the sentence of death He passed on me, for having trespassed\nagainst Him.\"",
        "55:6": "Then, when the angels heard these words, they all grieved over him;\nand cursed Satan who had misled Adam, until he came from the garden to\nmisery; from life to death; from peace to trouble; and from gladness to\na strange land.",
        "55:7": "Then the angels said to Adam, \"You obeyed Satan, and ignored the Word\nof God who created you; and you believed that Satan would fulfil all he\nhad promised you.",
        "55:8": "But now, O Adam, we will make known to you, what came over us though\nhim, before his fall from heaven.",
        "55:9": "He gathered together his hosts, and deceived them, promising to give\nthem a great kingdom, a divine nature; and other promises he made them.",
        "55:10": "His hosts believed that his word was true, so they yielded to him,\nand renounced the glory of God.",
        "55:11": "He then sent for us--according to the orders in which we were--to\ncome under his command, and to accept his vein promise.  But we would\nnot, and we did not take his advice.",
        "55:12": "Then after he had fought with God, and had dealt forwardly with Him,\nhe gathered together his hosts, and made war with us.  And if it had\nnot been for God's strength that was with us, we could not have\nprevailed against him to hurl him from heaven.",
        "55:13": "But when he fell from among us, there was great joy in heaven,\nbecause of his going down from us.  For if he had remained in heaven,\nnothing, not even one angel would have remained in it.",
        "55:14": "But God in His mercy, drove him from among us to this dark earth;\nfor he had become darkness itself and a worker of unrighteousness.",
        "55:15": "And he has continued, O Adam, to make war against you, until he\ntricked you and made you come out of the garden, to this strange land,\nwhere all these trials have come to you.  And death, which God brought\nto him, he has also brought to you, O Adam, because you obeyed him, and\ntrespassed against God.\"",
        "55:16": "Then all the angels rejoiced and praised God, and asked Him not to\ndestroy Adam this time, for his having sought to enter the garden; but\nto bear with him until the fulfillment of the promise; and to help him\nin this world until he was free from Satan's hand.",
        "56:1": "Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said to him:--",
        "56:2": "\"O Adam, look at that garden of joy and at this earth of toil, and\nbehold the garden is full of angels, but look at yourself alone on this\nearth with Satan whom you obeyed.",
        "56:3": "Yet, if you had submitted, and been obedient to Me, and had kept My\nWord, you would be with My angels in My garden.",
        "56:4": "But when you transgressed and obeyed Satan, you became his guests\namong his angels, that are full of wickedness; and you came to this\nearth, that brings forth to you thorns and thistles.",
        "56:5": "O Adam, ask him who deceived you, to give you the divine nature he\npromised you, or to make you a garden as I had made for you; or to fill\nyou with that same bright nature with which I had filled you.",
        "56:6": "Ask him to make you a body like the one I made you, or to give you a\nday of rest as I gave you; or to create within you a reasonable soul,\nas I created for you; or to take you from here to some other earth than\nthis one which I gave you.  But, O Adam, he will not fulfil even one of\nthe things he told you.",
        "56:7": "Acknowledge, then, My favor towards you, and My mercy on you, My\ncreature; that I have not avenged you for your transgression against\nMe, but in My pity for you I have promised you that at the end of the\ngreat five and a half days I will come and save you.\"",
        "56:8": "Then God said again to Adam and Eve, \"Get up, go down from here,\nbefore the cherub with a sword of fire in his hand destroys you.\"",
        "56:9": "But Adam's heart was comforted by God's words to him, and he\nworshipped before Him.",
        "56:10": "And God commanded His angels to escort Adam and Eve to the cave with\njoy, instead of the fear that had come over them.",
        "56:11": "Then the angels took up Adam and Eve, and brought them down from the\nmountain by the garden, with songs and psalms, until they arrived at\nthe cave.  There the angels began to comfort and to strengthen them,\nand then departed from them towards heaven, to their Creator, who had\nsent them.",
        "56:12": "But after the angels had departed from Adam and Eve, Satan came with\nshamefacedness, and stood at the entrance of the cave in which were\nAdam and Eve.  He then called to Adam, and said, \"O Adam, come, let me\nspeak to you.\"",
        "56:13": "Then Adam came out of the cave, thinking he was one of God's angels\nthat was come to give him some good counsel.",
        "57:1": "But when Adam came out and saw his hideous figure, he was afraid of\nhim, and said to him, \"Who are you?\"",
        "57:2": "Then Satan answered and said to him, \"It is I, who hid myself within\nthe serpent, and who spoke to Eve, and who enticed her until she obeyed\nmy command.  I am he who sent her, using my deceitful speech, to\ndeceive you,  until you both ate of the fruit of the tree and abandoned\nthe command of God.\"",
        "57:3": "But when Adam heard these words from him, he said to him, \"Can you\nmake me a garden as God made for me?  Or can you clothe me in the same\nbright nature in which God had clothed me?",
        "57:4": "Where is the divine nature you promised to give me?  Where is that\nslick speech of yours that you had with us at first, when we were in\nthe garden?\"",
        "57:5": "Then Satan said to Adam, \"Do you think that when I have promised one\nsomething that I would actually deliver it to him or fulfil my word?\nOf course not.  For I myself have never even thought of obtaining what\nI promised.",
        "57:6": "Therefore I fell, and I made you fall by that for which I myself\nfell; and with you also, whosoever accepts my counsel, falls thereby.",
        "57:7": "But now, O Adam, because you fell you are under my rule, and I am\nking over you; because you have obeyed me and have transgressed against\nyour God.  Neither will there be any deliverance from my hands until\nthe day promised you by your God.\"",
        "57:8": "Again he said, \"Because we do not know the day agreed on with you by\nyour God, nor the hour in which you shall be delivered, for that reason\nwe will multiply war and murder on you and your descendants after you.",
        "57:9": "This is our will and our good pleasure, that we may not leave one of\nthe sons of men to inherit our orders in heaven.",
        "57:10": "For as to our home, O Adam, it is in burning fire; and we will not\nstop our evil doing, no, not one day nor one hour.  And I, O Adam,\nshall set you on fire when you come into the cave to live there.\"",
        "57:11": "When Adam heard these words he cried and mourned, and said to Eve,\n\"Hear what he said; that he won't fulfil any of what he told you in the\ngarden.  Did he really then become king over us?",
        "57:12": "But we will ask God, who created us, to deliver us out of his hands.\"",
        "58:1": "Then Adam and Eve spread their hands before God, praying and begging\nHim to drive Satan away from them so that he can't harm them or force\nthem to deny God.",
        "58:2": "Then God sent to them at once, His angel, who drove away Satan from\nthem.  This happened about sunset, on the fifty-third day after they\nhad come out of the garden.",
        "58:3": "Then Adam and Eve went into the cave, and stood up and turned their\nfaces to the ground, to pray to God.",
        "58:4": "But before they prayed Adam said to Eve, \"Look, you have seen what\ntemptations have befallen us in this land.  Come, let us get up, and\nask God to forgive us the sins we have committed; and we will not come\nout until the end of the day next to the fortieth.  And if we die in\nhere, He will save us.\"",
        "58:5": "Then Adam and Eve got up, and joined together in entreating God.",
        "58:6": "They continued praying like this in the cave; neither did they come\nout of it, by night or by day, until their prayers went up out of their\nmouths, like a flame of fire.",
        "59:1": "But Satan, the hater of all good, did not allow them to finish their\nprayers.  For he called to his hosts, and they came, all of them.  Then\nhe said to them, \"Since Adam and Eve, whom we deceived, have agreed\ntogether to pray to God night and day, and to beg Him to deliver them,\nand since they will not come out of the cave until the end of the\nfortieth day.",
        "59:2": "And since they will continue their prayers as they have both agreed\nto do, that He will deliver them out of our hands, and restore them to\ntheir former state, see what we shall do to them.\"  And his hosts said\nto him, \"Power is thine, O our lord, to do what you list.\"",
        "59:3": "Then Satan, great in wickedness, took his hosts and came into the\ncave, in the thirtieth night of the forty days and one; and he beat\nAdam and Eve, until he left them dead.",
        "59:4": "Then came the Word of God to Adam and Eve, who raised them from their\nsuffering, and God said to Adam, \"Be strong, and be not afraid of him\nwho has just come to you.\"",
        "59:5": "But Adam cried and said, \"Where were you, O my God, that they should\npunish me with such blows, and that this suffering should come over us;\nover me and over Eve, Your handmaiden?\"",
        "59:6": "Then God said to him, \"O Adam, see, he is lord and master of all you\nhave, he who said, he would give you divinity.  Where is this love for\nyou?  And where is the gift he promised?",
        "59:7": "Did it please him just once, O Adam, to come to you, comfort you,\nstrengthen you, rejoice with you, or send his hosts to protect you;\nbecause you have obeyed him, and have yielded to his counsel; and have\nfollowed his commandment and transgressed Mine?\"",
        "59:8": "Then Adam cried before the Lord, and said, \"O Lord because I\ntransgressed a little, You have severely punished me in return for it,\nI ask You to deliver me out of his hands; or else have pity on me, and\ntake my soul out of my body now in this strange land.\"",
        "59:9": "Then God said to Adam, \"If only there had been this sighing and\npraying before, before you transgressed!  Then would you have rest from\nthe trouble in which you are now.\"",
        "59:10": "But God had patience with Adam, and let him and Eve remain in the\ncave until they had fulfilled the forty days.",
        "59:11": "But as to Adam and Eve, their strength and flesh withered from\nfasting and praying, from hunger and thirst; for they had not tasted\neither food or drink since they left the garden; nor were the functions\nof their bodies yet settled; and they had no strength left to continue\nin prayer from hunger, until the end of the next day to the fortieth.\nThey were fallen down in the cave; yet what speech escaped from their\nmouths, was only in praises.",
        "60:1": "Then on the eighty-ninth day, Satan came to the cave, clad in a\ngarment of light, and girt about with a bright girdle.",
        "60:2": "In his hands was a staff of light, and he looked most awful; but his\nface was pleasant and his speech was sweet.",
        "60:3": "He thus transformed himself in order to deceive Adam and Eve, and to\nmake them come out of the cave, before they had fulfilled the forty\ndays.",
        "60:4": "For he said within himself, \"Now that when they had fulfilled the\nforty days' fasting and praying, God would restore them to their former\nstate; but if He did not do so, He would still be favorable to them;\nand even if He had not mercy on them, would He yet give them something\nfrom the garden to comfort them; as already twice before.\"",
        "60:5": "Then Satan drew near the cave in this fair appearance, and said:--",
        "60:6": "\"O Adam, get up, stand up, you and Eve, and come along with me, to a\ngood land; and don't be afraid.  I am flesh and bones like you; and at\nfirst I was a creature that God created.",
        "60:7": "And it was so, that when He had created me, He placed me in a garden\nin the north, on the border of the world.",
        "60:8": "And He said to me, 'Stay here!'  And I remained there according to\nHis Word, neither did I transgress His commandment.",
        "60:9": "Then He made a slumber to come over me, and He brought you, O Adam,\nout of my side, but did not make you stay with me.",
        "60:10": "But God took you in His divine hand, and placed you in a garden to\nthe eastward.",
        "60:11": "Then I worried about you, for that while God had taken you out of my\nside, He had not let you stay with me.",
        "60:12": "But God said to me: 'Do not worry about Adam, whom I brought out of\nyour side; no harm will come to him.",
        "60:13": "For now I have brought out of his side a help-meet for him; and I\nhave given him joy by so doing.'\"",
        "60:14": "Then Satan said again, \"I did not know how it is you are in this\ncave, nor anything about this trial that has come over you--until God\nsaid to me, 'Behold, Adam has transgressed, he whom I had taken out of\nyour side, and Eve also, whom I took out of his side; and I have driven\nthem out of the garden; I have made them live in a land of sorrow and\nmisery, because they transgressed against Me, and have obeyed Satan.\nAnd look, they are in suffering until this day, the eightieth.'",
        "60:15": "Then God said to me, 'Get up, go to them, and make them come to your\nplace, and suffer not that Satan come near them, and afflict them.  For\nthey are now in great misery; and lie helpless from hunger.'",
        "60:16": "He further said to me, 'When you have taken them to yourself, give\nthem to eat of the fruit of the Tree of Life, and give them to drink of\nthe water of peace; and clothe them in a garment of light, and restore\nthem to their former state of grace, and leave them not in misery, for\nthey came from you.  But grieve not over them, nor repent of that which\nhas come over them.",
        "60:17": "But when I heard this, I was sorry; and my heart could not patiently\nbear it for your sake, O my child.",
        "60:18": "But, O Adam, when I heard the name of Satan, I was afraid, and I\nsaid within myself, I will not come out because he might trap me as he\ndid my children, Adam and Eve.",
        "60:19": "And I said, 'O God, when I go to my children, Satan will meet me in\nthe way, and war against me, as he did against them.'",
        "60:20": "Then God said to me, 'Fear not; when you find him, hit him with the\nstaff that is in thine hand, and don't be afraid of him, for you are of\nold standing, and he shall not prevail against you.'",
        "60:21": "Then I said, 'O my Lord, I am old, and cannot go.  Send Your angels\nto bring them.'",
        "60:22": "But God said to me, 'Angels, verily, are not like them; and they\nwill not consent to come with them.  But I have chosen you, because\nthey are your offspring and are like you, and they will listen to what\nyou say.'",
        "60:23": "God said further to me, 'If you don't have enough strength to walk,\nI will send a cloud to carry you and set you down at the entrance of\ntheir cave; then the cloud will return and leave you there.",
        "60:24": "And if they will come with you, I will send a cloud to carry you and\nthem.'",
        "60:25": "Then He commanded a cloud, and it bear me up and brought me to you;\nand then went back.",
        "60:26": "And now, O my children, Adam and Eve, look at my old gray hair and\nat my feeble state, and at my coming from that distant place.  Come,\ncome with me, to a place of rest.\"",
        "60:27": "Then he began to cry and to sob before Adam and Eve, and his tears\npoured on the ground like water.",

        "61:13": "Then Adam and Eve stood up and with a fiery passion, prayed to God,\nto give them strength; for they had become weak because of  hunger and\nthirst and prayer.  But they watched the whole of that night praying,\nuntil morning.",
        "61:14": "Then Adam said to Eve, \"Get up, let us go towards the eastern gate\nof the garden as God told us.\"",
        "61:15": "And they said their prayers as they were accustomed to do every day;\nand they left the cave to go near to the eastern gate of the garden.",
        "61:16": "Then Adam and Eve stood up and prayed, and appealed to God to\nstrengthen them, and to send them something to satisfy their hunger.",
        "61:17": "But after they finished their prayers, they were too weak to move.",
        "61:18": "Then came the Word of God again, and said to them, \"O Adam, get up,\ngo and bring the two figs here.\"",
        "61:19": "Then Adam and Eve got up, and went until they came near to the cave.",
        "62:1": "But Satan the wicked was envious, because of the consolation God had\ngiven them.",
        "62:2": "So he prevented them, and went into the cave and took the two figs,\nand buried them outside the cave, so that Adam and Eve should not find\nthem.  He also had in his thoughts to destroy them.",
        "62:3": "But by God's mercy, as soon as those two figs were in the ground, God\ndefeated Satan's counsel regarding them; and made them into two fruit\ntrees, that overshadowed the cave.  For Satan had buried them on the\neastern side of it.",
        "62:4": "Then when the two trees were grown, and were covered with fruit,\nSatan grieved and mourned, and said, \"It would have been better to have\nleft those figs where they were; for now, behold, they have become two\nfruit trees, whereof Adam will eat all the days of his life.  Whereas I\nhad in mind, when I buried them, to destroy them entirely, and to hide\nthem forever.",
        "62:5": "But God has overturned my counsel; and would not that this sacred\nfruit should perish; and He has made plain my intention, and has\ndefeated the counsel I had formed against His servants.\"",
        "62:6": "Then Satan went away ashamed because he hadn't thought his plans all\nthe way through.",
        "63:1": "But Adam and Eve, as they got closer to the cave, saw two fig trees,\ncovered with fruit, and overshadowing the cave.",
        "63:2": "Then Adam said to Eve, \"It seems to me that we have gone the wrong\nway.  When did these two trees grow here?  It seems to me that the\nenemy wishes to lead us the wrong way.  Do you suppose that there is\nanother cave besides this one in the earth?",
        "63:3": "Yet, O Eve, let us go into the cave, and find in it the two figs; for\nthis is our cave, in which we were.  But if we should not find the two\nfigs in it, then it cannot be our cave.\"",
        "63:4": "They went then into the cave, and looked into the four corners of it,\nbut found not the two figs.",
        "63:5": "And Adam cried and said to Eve, \"Did we go to the wrong cave, then, O\nEve?  It seems to me these two fig trees are the two figs that were in\nthe cave.\"  And Eve said, \"I, for my part, do not know.\"",
        "63:6": "Then Adam stood up and prayed and said, \"O God, You commanded us to\ncome back to the cave, to take the two figs, and then to return to you.",
        "63:7": "But now, we have not found them.  O God, have you taken them, and\nsown these two trees, or have we gone astray in the earth; or has the\nenemy deceived us?  If it be real, then, O God, reveal to us the secret\nof these two trees and of the two figs.\"",
        "63:8": "Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said to him, \"O Adam, when I\nsent you to fetch the figs, Satan went before you to the cave, took the\nfigs, and buried them outside, eastward of the cave, thinking to\ndestroy them; and not sowing them with good intent.",
        "63:9": "Not for his mere sake, then, have these trees grown up at once; but I\nhad mercy on you and I commanded them to grow.  And they grew to be two\nlarge trees, that you be overshadowed by their branches, and find rest;\nand that I made you see My power and My marvelous works.",
        "63:10": "And, also, to show you Satan's meanness, and his evil works, for\never since you came out of the garden, he has not ceased, no, not one\nday, from doing you some harm.  But I have not given him power over\nyou.\"",
        "63:11": "And God said, \"From now on, O Adam, rejoice on account of the trees,\nyou and Eve; and rest under them when you feel weary.  But do not eat\nany of their fruit or come near them.\"",
        "63:12": "Then Adam cried, and said, \"O God, will You again kill us, or will\nYou drive us away from before Your face, and cut our life from off the\nface of the earth?",
        "63:13": "O God, I beg you, if You know that there be in these trees either\ndeath or some other evil, as at the first time, root them up from near\nour cave, and with them; and leave us to die of the heat, of hunger and\nof thirst.",
        "63:14": "For we know Your marvelous works, O God, that they are great, and\nthat by Your power You can bring one thing out of another, without\none's wish.  For Your power can make rocks to become trees, and trees\nto become rocks.\"",
        "64:1": "Then God looked at Adam and at his strength of mind, at his endurance\nof hunger and thirst, and of the heat.  And He changed the two fig\ntrees into two figs, as they were at first, and then said to Adam and\nto Eve, \"Each of you may take one fig.\"  And they took them, as the\nLord commanded them.",
        "64:2": "And He said to them, \"You must now go into the cave and eat the figs,\nand satisfy your hunger, or else you will die.\"",
        "64:3": "So, as God commanded them, they went into the cave about sunset.  And\nAdam and Eve stood up and prayed during the setting sun.",
        "64:4": "Then they sat down to eat the figs; but they knew not how to eat\nthem; for they were not accustomed to eat earthly food.  They were\nafraid that if they ate, their stomach would be burdened and their\nflesh thickened, and their hearts would take to liking earthly food.",
        "64:5": "But while they were thus seated, God, out of pity for them, sent them\nHis angel, so they wouldn't perish of hunger and thirst.",
        "64:6": "And the angel said to Adam and Eve, \"God says to you that you do not\nhave the strength that would be required to fast until death; eat,\ntherefore, and strengthen your bodies; for you are now animal flesh and\ncannot subsist without food and drink.\"",
        "64:7": "Then Adam and Eve took the figs and began to eat of them.  But God\nhad put into them a mixture as of savory bread and blood.",
        "64:8": "Then the angel went from Adam and Eve, who ate of the figs until they\nhad satisfied their hunger.  Then they put aside what was left; but by\nthe power of God, the figs became whole again, because God blessed them.",
        "64:9": "After this Adam and Eve got up, and prayed with a joyful heart and\nrenewed strength, and praised and rejoiced abundantly the whole of that\nnight.  And this was the end of the eighty-third day.",
        "65:1": "And when it was day, they got up and prayed, after their custom, and\nthen went out of the cave.",
        "65:2": "But they became sick from the food they had eaten because they were\nnot used to it, so they went about in the cave saying to each other:--",
        "65:3": "\"What has our eating caused to happen to us, that we should be in\nsuch pain?  We are in misery, we shall die!  It would have been better\nfor us to have died keeping our bodies pure than to have eaten and\ndefiled them with food.\"",
        "65:4": "Then Adam said to Eve, \"This pain did not come to us in the garden,\nneither did we eat such bad food there.  Do you think, O Eve, that God\nwill plague us through the food that is in us, or that our innards will\ncome out; or that God means to kill us with this pain before He has\nfulfilled His promise to us?\"",
        "65:5": "Then Adam besought the Lord and said, \"O Lord, let us not perish\nthrough the food we have eaten.  O Lord, don't punish us; but deal with\nus according to Your great mercy, and forsake us not until the day of\nthe promise You have made us.\"",
        "65:6": "Then God looked at them, and then fitted them for eating food at\nonce; as to this day; so that they should not perish.",
        "65:7": "Then Adam and Eve came back into the cave sorrowful and crying\nbecause of the alteration of their bodies.  And they both knew from\nthat hour that they were altered beings, that all hope of returning to\nthe garden was now lost; and that they could not enter it.",
        "65:8": "For that now their bodies had strange functions; and all flesh that\nrequires food and drink for its existence, cannot be in the garden.",
        "65:9": "Then Adam said to Eve, \"Behold, our hope is now lost; and so is our\ntrust to enter the garden.  We no longer belong to the inhabitants of\nthe garden; but from now on we are earthy and of the dust, and of the\ninhabitants of the earth.  We shall not return to the garden, until the\nday in which God has promised to save us, and to bring us again into\nthe garden, as He promised us.\"",
        "65:10": "Then they prayed to God that He would have mercy on them; after\nwhich, their mind was quieted, their hearts were broken, and their\nlonging was cooled down; and they were like strangers on earth.  That\nnight Adam and Eve spent in the cave, where they slept heavily by\nreason of the food they had eaten.",
        "66:1": "When it was morning, the day after they had eaten food, Adam and Eve\nprayed in the cave, and Adam said to Eve, \"Look, we asked for food of\nGod, and He gave it.  But now let us also ask Him to give us a drink of\nwater.\"",
        "66:2": "Then they got up, and went to the bank of the stream of water, that\nwas on the south border of the garden, in which they had before thrown\nthemselves.  And they stood on the bank, and prayed to God that He\nwould command them to drink of the water.",
        "66:3": "Then the Word of God came to Adam, and said to him, \"O Adam, your\nbody has become brutish, and requires water to drink.  Take some and\ndrink it, you and Eve, then give thanks and praise.\"",
        "66:4": "Adam and Eve then went down to the stream and drank from it, until\ntheir bodies felt refreshed.  After having drunk, they praised God, and\nthen returned to their cave, after their former custom.  This happened\nat the end of eighty-three days.",
        "66:5": "Then on the eighty-fourth day, they took the two figs and hung them\nin the cave, together with the leaves thereof, to be to them a sign and\na blessing from God.  And they placed them there so that if their\ndescendants came there, they would see the wonderful things God had\ndone for them.",
        "66:6": "Then Adam and Eve again stood outside the cave, and asked God to show\nthem some food with which they could nourish their bodies.",
        "66:7": "Then the Word of God came and said to him, \"O Adam, go down to the\nwestward of the cave until you come to a land of dark soil, and there\nyou shall find food.\"",
        "66:8": "And Adam obeyed the Word of God, took Eve, and went down to a land of\ndark soil, and found there wheat growing in the ear and ripe, and figs\nto eat; and Adam rejoiced over it.",
        "66:9": "Then the Word of God came again to Adam, and said to him, \"Take some\nof this wheat and make yourselves some bread with it, to nourish your\nbody therewith.\"  And God gave Adam's heart wisdom, to work out the\ncorn until it became bread.",
        "66:10": "Adam accomplished all that, until he grew very faint and weary.  He\nthen returned to the cave; rejoicing at what he had learned of what is\ndone with wheat, until it is made into bread for one's use.",
        "67:1": "When Adam and Eve went down to the land of black mud and came near to\nthe wheat God had showed them and saw that it was ripe and ready for\nreaping, they did not have a sickle to reap it with.  So they readied\nthemselves, and began to pull up the wheat by hand, until it was all\ndone.",
        "67:2": "Then they heaped it into a pile; and, faint from heat and from\nthirst, they went under a shady tree, where the breeze fanned them to\nsleep.",
        "67:3": "But Satan saw what Adam and Eve had done.  And he called his hosts,\nand said to them, \"Since God has shown to Adam and Eve all about this\nwheat, wherewith to strengthen their bodies--and, look, they have come\nand made a big pile of it, and faint from the toil are now\nasleep--come, let us set fire to this heap of corn, and burn it, and\nlet us take that bottle of water that is by them, and empty it out, so\nthat they may find nothing to drink, and we kill them with hunger and\nthirst.",
        "67:4": "Then, when they wake up from their sleep, and seek to return to the\ncave, we will come to them in the way, and will lead them astray; so\nthat they die of hunger and thirst; when they may, perhaps, deny God,\nand He destroy them.  So shall we be rid of them.\"",
        "67:5": "Then Satan and his hosts set the wheat on fire and burned it up.",
        "67:6": "But from the heat of the flame Adam and Eve awoke from their sleep,\nand saw the wheat burning, and the bucket of water by them, poured out.",
        "67:7": "Then they cried and went back to the cave.",
        "67:8": "But as they were going up from below the mountain where they were,\nSatan and his hosts met them in the form of angels, praising God.",
        "67:9": "Then Satan said to Adam, \"O Adam, why are you so pained with hunger\nand thirst?  It seems to me that Satan has burnt up the wheat.\"  And\nAdam said to him, \"Yes.\"",
        "67:10": "Again Satan said to Adam, \"Come back with us; we are angels of God.\nGod sent us to you, to show you another field of corn, better than\nthat; and beyond it is a fountain of good water, and many trees, where\nyou shall live near it, and work the corn field to better purpose than\nthat which Satan has consumed.\"",
        "67:11": "Adam thought that he was true, and that they were angels who talked\nwith him; and he went back with them.",
        "67:12": "Then Satan began to lead astray Adam and Eve eight days, until they\nboth fell down as if dead, from hunger, thirst, and faintness.  Then he\nfled with his hosts, and left them.",
        "68:1": "Then God looked at Adam and Eve, and at what had come over them from\nSatan, and how he had made them perish.",
        "68:2": "God, therefore, sent His Word, and raised up Adam and Eve from their\nstate of death.",
        "68:3": "Then, Adam, when he was raised, said, \"O God, You have burnt and\ntaken from us the corn You have given us, and You have emptied out the\nbucket of water.  And You have sent Your angels, who have caused us to\nlose our way from the corn field.  Will You make us perish?  If this be\nfrom you, O God, then take away our souls; but punish us not.\"",
        "68:4": "Then God said to Adam, \"I did not burn down the wheat, and I did not\npour the water out of the bucket, and I did not send My angels to lead\nyou astray.",
        "68:5": "But it is Satan, your master who did it; he to whom you have\nsubjected yourself; my commandment being meanwhile set aside.  He it\nis, who burnt down the corn, and poured out the water, and who has led\nyou astray; and all the promises he has made you were just a trick, a\ndeception, and a lie.",
        "68:6": "But now, O Adam, you shall acknowledge My good deeds done to you.\"",
        "68:7": "And God told His angels to take Adam and Eve, and to bear them up to\nthe field of wheat, which they found as before, with the bucket full of\nwater.",
        "68:8": "There they saw a tree, and found on it solid manna; and wondered at\nGod's power.  And the angels commanded them to eat of the manna when\nthey were hungry.",
        "68:9": "And God admonished Satan with a curse, not to come again, and destroy\nthe field of corn.",
        "68:10": "Then Adam and Eve took of the corn, and made of it an offering, and\ntook it and offered it up on the mountain, the place where they had\noffered up their first offering of blood.",
        "68:11": "And they offered this offering again on the altar they had built at\nfirst.  And they stood up and prayed, and besought the Lord saying,\n\"Thus, O God, when we were in the garden,  our praises went up to you,\nlike this offering; and our innocence went up to you like incense.  But\nnow, O God, accept this offering from us, and don't turn us away,\ndeprived of Your mercy.\"",
        "68:12": "Then God said to Adam and Eve, \"Since you have made this offering\nand have offered it to Me, I shall make it My flesh, when I come down\non earth to save you; and I shall cause it to be offered continually on\nan altar, for forgiveness and for mercy, for those who partake of it\nduly.\"",
        "68:13": "And God sent a bright fire over the offering of Adam and Eve, and\nfilled it with brightness, grace, and light; and the Holy Ghost came\ndown on that offering.",
        "68:14": "Then God commanded an angel to take fire tongs, like a spoon, and\nwith it to take an offering and bring it to Adam and Eve.  And the\nangel did so, as God had commanded him, and offered it to them.",
        "68:15": "And the souls of Adam and Eve were brightened, and their hearts were\nfilled with joy and gladness and with the praises of God.",
        "68:16": "And God said to Adam, \"This shall be to  you a custom, to do so,\nwhen affliction and sorrow come over you.  But your deliverance and\nyour entrance in to the garden, shall not be until the days are\nfulfilled as agreed between you and Me; were it not so, I would, of My\nmercy and pity for you, bring you back to My garden and to My favor for\nthe sake of the offering you have just made to My name.\"",
        "68:17": "Adam rejoiced at these words which he heard from God; and he and Eve\nworshipped before the altar, to which they bowed, and then went back to\nthe Cave of Treasures.",
        "68:18": "And this took place at the end of the twelfth day after the\neightieth day, from the time Adam and Eve came out of the garden.",
        "68:19": "And they stood up the whole night praying until morning; and then\nwent out of the cave.",
        "68:20": "Then Adam said to Eve, with joy of heart, because of the offering\nthey had made to God, and that had been accepted of Him, \"Let us do\nthis three times every week, on the fourth day Wednesday, on the\npreparation day Friday, and on the Sabbath Sunday, all the days of our\nlife.\"",
        "68:21": "And as they agreed to these words between themselves, God was\npleased with their thoughts, and with the resolution they had each\ntaken with the other.",
        "68:22": "After this, came the Word of God to Adam, and said, \"O Adam, you\nhave determined beforehand the days in which sufferings shall come over\nMe, when I am made flesh; for they are the fourth Wednesday, and the\npreparation day Friday.",
        "68:23": "But as to the first day, I created in it all things, and I raised\nthe heavens.  And, again, through My rising again on this day, will I\ncreate joy, and raise them on high, who believe in Me; O Adam, offer\nthis offering, all the days of your life.\"",
        "68:24": "Then God withdrew His Word from Adam.",
        "68:25": "But Adam continued to offer this offering thus, every week three\ntimes, until the end of seven weeks.  And on the first day, which is\nthe fiftieth, Adam made an offering as he was accustomed, and he and\nEve took it and came to the altar before God, as He had taught them.",
        "69:1": "Then Satan, the hater of all good, envious of Adam and of his\noffering through which he found favor with God, hastened and took a\nsharp stone from among the sharp iron stones; appeared in the form of a\nman, and went and stood by Adam and Eve.",
        "69:2": "Adam was then offering on the altar, and had begun to pray, with his\nhands spread before God.",
        "69:3": "Then Satan hastened with the sharp iron stone he had with him, and\nwith it pierced Adam on the right side, from which flowed blood and\nwater, then Adam fell on the altar like a corpse.  And Satan fled.",
        "69:4": "Then Eve came, and took Adam and placed him below the altar.  And\nthere she stayed, crying over him; while a stream of blood flowed from\nAdam's side over his offering.",
        "69:5": "But God looked at the death of Adam.  He then sent His Word, and\nraised him up and said to him, \"Fulfil your offering, for indeed, Adam,\nit is worth much, and there is no shortcoming in it.\"",
        "69:6": "God said further to Adam, \"Thus will it also happen to Me, on the\nearth, when I shall be pierced and blood and water shall flow from My\nside and run over My body, which is the true offering; and which shall\nbe offered on the altar as a perfect offering.\"",
        "69:7": "Then God commanded Adam to finish his offering, and when he had ended\nit he worshipped before God, and praised Him for the signs He had\nshowed him.",
        "69:8": "And God healed Adam in one day, which is the end of the seven weeks;\nand that is the fiftieth day.",
        "69:9": "Then Adam and Eve returned from the mountain, and went into the Cave\nof Treasures, as they were used to do.  This completed for Adam and\nEve, one hundred and forty days since their coming out of the garden.",
        "69:10": "Then they both stood up that night and prayed to God.  And when it\nwas morning, they went out, and went down westward of the cave, to the\nplace where their corn was, and there rested under the shadow of a\ntree, as they were accustomed.",
        "69:11": "But when there a multitude of beasts came all around them.  It was\nSatan's doing, in his wickedness; in order to wage war against Adam\nthrough marriage.",
        "70:1": "After this Satan, the hater of all good, took the form of an angel,\nand with him two others, so that they looked like the three angels who\nhad brought to Adam gold, incense, and myrrh.",
        "70:2": "They passed before Adam and Eve while they were under the tree, and\ngreeted Adam and Eve with fair words that were full of deceit.",
        "70:3": "But when Adam and Eve saw their pleasant expression, and heard their\nsweet speech, Adam rose, welcomed them, and brought them to Eve, and\nthey remained all together; Adam's heart the while, being glad because\nhe thought concerning them, that they were the same angels, who had\nbrought him gold, incense, and myrrh.",
        "70:4": "Because, when they came to Adam the first time, there came over him\nfrom them, peace and joy, through their bringing him good tokens; so\nAdam thought that they had come a second time to give him other tokens\nfor him to rejoice therewith.  For he did not know it was Satan;\ntherefore he received them with joy and consorted with them.",
        "70:5": "Then Satan, the tallest of them, said, \"Rejoice, O Adam, and be glad.\nLook, God has sent us to you to tell you something.\"",
        "70:6": "And Adam said, \"What is it?\"  Then Satan answered, \"It is a simple\nthing, yet it is the Word of God, will you accept it from us and do it?\nBut if you will not accept it, we will return to God, and tell Him that\nyou would not receive His Word.\"",
        "70:7": "And Satan said again to Adam, \"Don't be afraid and don't tremble;\ndon't you know us?\"",
        "70:8": "But Adam said, \"I do not know you.\"",
        "70:9": "Then Satan said to him, \"I am the angel that brought you gold, and\ntook it to the cave; this other angel is the one that brought you\nincense; and that third angel, is the one who brought you myrrh when\nyou were on top of the mountain, and who carried you to the cave.",
        "70:10": "But as to the other angels our fellows, who bare you to the cave,\nGod has not sent them with us this time; for He said to us, 'You will\nbe enough'.\"",
        "70:11": "So when Adam heard these words he believed them, and said to these\nangels, \"Speak the Word of God, that I may receive it.\"",
        "70:12": "And Satan said to him, \"Swear, and promise me that you will receive\nit.\"",
        "70:13": "Then Adam said, \"I do not know how to swear and promise.\"",
        "70:14": "And Satan said to him, \"Hold out your hand, and put it inside my\nhand.\"",
        "70:15": "Then Adam held out his hand, and put it into Satan's hand; when\nSatan said to him, \"Say, now--So true as God is living, rational, and\nspeaking, who raised the stars in heaven, and established the dry\nground on the waters, and has created me out of the four elements, and\nout of the dust of the earth--I will not break my promise, nor renounce\nmy word.\"",
        "70:16": "And Adam swore thus.",
        "70:17": "Then Satan said to him, \"Look, it is now some time since you came\nout of the garden, and you know neither wickedness nor evil.  But now\nGod says to you, to take Eve who came out of your side, and to marry\nher so that she will bear you children, to comfort you, and to drive\nfrom you trouble and sorrow; now this thing is not difficult, neither\nis there any scandal in it to you.",
        "71:1": "But when Adam heard these words from Satan, he sorrowed much, because\nof his oath and of his promise, and said, \"Shall I commit adultery with\nmy flesh and my bones, and shall I sin against myself, for God to\ndestroy me, and to blot me out from off the face of the earth?",
        "71:2": "Since, when at first, I ate of the tree, He drove me out of the\ngarden into this strange land, and deprived me of my bright nature, and\nbrought death over me.  If, then, I should do this, He will cut off my\nlife from the earth, and He will cast me into hell, and will plague me\nthere a long time.",
        "71:3": "But God never spoke the words that you have said; and you are not\nGod's angels, and you weren't sent from Him.  But you are devils that\nhave come to me under the false appearance of angels.  Away from me;\nyou cursed of God!\"",
        "71:4": "Then those devils fled from before Adam.  And he and Eve got up, and\nreturned to the Cave of Treasures, and went into it.",
        "71:5": "Then Adam said to Eve, \"If you saw what I did, don't tell anyone; for\nI sinned against God in swearing by His great name, and I have placed\nmy hand another time into that of Satan.\"  Eve, then, held her peace,\nas Adam told her.",
        "71:6": "Then Adam got up, and spread his hands before God, beseeching and\nentreating Him with tears, to forgive him what he had done.  And Adam\nremained thus standing and praying forty days and forty nights.  He\nneither ate nor drank until he dropped down on the ground from hunger\nand thirst.",
        "71:7": "Then God sent His Word to Adam, who raised him up from where he lay,\nand said to him, \"O Adam, why have you sworn by My name, and why have\nyou made agreement with Satan another time?\"",
        "71:8": "But Adam cried, and said, \"O God, forgive me, for I did this\nunwittingly; believing they were God's angels.\"",
        "71:9": "And God forgave Adam, saying to him, \"Beware of Satan.\"",
        "71:10": "And He withdrew His Word from Adam.",
        "71:11": "Then Adam's heart was comforted; and he took Eve, and they went out\nof the cave, to prepare some food for their bodies.",
        "71:12": "But from that day Adam struggled in his mind about his marrying Eve;\nafraid that if he was to do it, God would be angry with him.",
        "71:13": "Then Adam and Eve went to the river of water, and sat on the bank,\nas people do when they enjoy themselves.",
        "71:14": "But Satan was jealous of them; and planned to destroy them.",
        "72:1": "Then Satan, and ten from his hosts, transformed themselves into\nmaidens, unlike any others in the whole world for grace.",
        "72:2": "They came up out of the river in presence of Adam and Eve, and they\nsaid among themselves, \"Come, we will look at the faces of Adam and\nEve, who are of the men on earth.  How beautiful they are, and how\ndifferent is their look from our own faces.\"  Then they came to Adam\nand Eve, and greeted them; and stood wondering at them.",
        "72:3": "Adam and Eve looked at them also, and wondered at their beauty, and\nsaid, \"Is there, then, under us, another world, with such beautiful\ncreatures as these in it?\"",
        "72:4": "And those maidens said to Adam and Eve, \"Yes, indeed, we are an\nabundant creation.\"",
        "72:5": "Then Adam said to them, \"But how do you multiply?\"",
        "72:6": "And they answered him, \"We have husbands who have married us, and we\nbear them children, who grow up, and who in their turn marry and are\nmarried, and also bear children; and thus we increase.  And if so be, O\nAdam, you will not believe us, we will show you our husbands and our\nchildren.\"",
        "72:7": "Then they shouted over the river as if to call their husbands and\ntheir children, who came up from the river, men and children; and every\nman came to his wife, his children being with him.",
        "72:8": "But when Adam and Eve saw them, they stood dumb, and wondered at them.",
        "72:9": "Then they said to Adam and Eve, \"See all our husbands and our\nchildren?  You should marry Eve, as we have married our husbands, so\nthat you will have children as we have.\" This was a device of Satan to\ndeceive Adam.",
        "72:10": "Satan also thought within himself, \"God at first commanded Adam\nconcerning the fruit of the tree, saying to him, 'Eat not of it; else\nof death you shall die.'  But Adam ate of it, and yet God did not kill\nhim; He only decreed on him death, and plagues and trials, until the\nday he shall come out of his body.",
        "72:11": "Now, then, if I deceive him to do this thing, and to marry Eve\nwithout God's permission, God will kill him then.\"",
        "72:12": "Therefore Satan worked this apparition before Adam and Eve; because\nhe sought to kill him, and to make him disappear from off the face of\nthe earth.",
        "72:13": "Meanwhile the fire of sin came over Adam, and he thought of\ncommitting sin.  But he restrained himself, fearing that if he followed\nthis advice of Satan, God would put him to death.",
        "72:14": "Then Adam and Eve got up, and prayed to God, while Satan and his\nhosts went down into the river, in presence of Adam and Eve; to let\nthem see that they were going back to their own world.",
        "72:15": "Then Adam and Eve went back to the Cave of Treasures, as they\nusually did; about evening time.",
        "72:16": "And they both got up and prayed to God that night.  Adam remained\nstanding in prayer, yet not knowing how to pray, by reason of the\nthoughts in his heart regarding his marrying Eve; and he continued so\nuntil morning.",
        "72:17": "And when light came up, Adam said to Eve, \"Get up, let us go below\nthe mountain, where they brought us gold, and let us ask the Lord\nconcerning this matter.\"",
        "72:18": "Then Eve said, \"What is that matter, O Adam?\"",
        "72:19": "And he answered her, \"That I may request the Lord to inform me about\nmarrying you; for I will not do it without His permission or else He\nwill make us perish, you and me.  For those devils have set my heart on\nfire, with thoughts of what they showed us, in their sinful apparitions.",
        "72:20": "Then Eve said to Adam, \"Why need we go below the mountain?  Let us\nrather stand up and pray in our cave to God, to let us know whether\nthis counsel is good or not.\"",
        "72:21": "Then Adam rose up in prayer and said, \"O God, you know that we\ntransgressed against you, and from the moment we transgressed, we were\nstripped of our bright nature; and our body became brutish, requiring\nfood and drink; and with animal desires.",
        "72:22": "Command us, O God, not to give way to them without Your permission,\nfor fear that You will turn us into nothing.  Because if you do not\ngive us permission, we shall be overpowered, and follow that advice of\nSatan; and You will again make us perish.",
        "72:23": "If not, then take our souls from us; let us be rid of this animal\nlust.  And if You give us no order respecting this thing, then sever\nEve from me, and me from her; and place us each far away from the other.",
        "72:24": "Then again, O God, if You separate us from each other, the devils\nwill deceive us with their apparitions that resemble us, and destroy\nour hearts, and defile our thoughts towards each other.  Yet if it is\nnot each of us towards the other, it will, at all events, be through\ntheir appearance when the devils come to us in our likeness.\" Here Adam\nended his prayer.",
        "73:1": "Then God considered the words of Adam that they were true, and that\nhe could long await His order, respecting the counsel of Satan.",
        "73:2": "And God approved Adam in what he had thought concerning this, and in\nthe prayer he had offered in His presence; and the Word of God came to\nAdam and said to him, \"O Adam, if only you had had this caution at\nfirst, before you came out of the garden into this land!\"",
        "73:3": "After that, God sent His angel who had brought gold, and the angel\nwho had brought incense, and the angel who had brought myrrh to Adam,\nthat they should inform him respecting his marriage to Eve.",
        "73:4": "Then those angels said to Adam, \"Take the gold and give it to Eve as\na wedding gift, and promise to marry her; then give her some incense\nand myrrh as a present; and be you, you and she, one flesh.\"",
        "73:5": "Adam obeyed the angels, and took the gold and put it into Eve's bosom\nin her garment; and promised to marry her with his hand.",
        "73:6": "Then the angels commanded Adam and Eve to get up and pray forty days\nand forty nights; when that was done, then Adam was to have sexual\nintercourse with his wife; for then this would be an act pure and\nundefiled; so that he would have children who would multiply, and\nreplenish the face of the earth.",
        "73:7": "Then both Adam and Eve received the words of the angels; and the\nangels departed from them.",
        "73:8": "Then Adam and Eve began to fast and pray, until the end of the forty\ndays; and then they had sexual intercourse, as the angels had told\nthem.  And from the time Adam left the garden until he wedded Eve, were\ntwo hundred and twenty-three days, that is seven months and thirteen\ndays.",
        "73:9": "Thus was Satan's war with Adam defeated.",
        "74:1": "And they lived on the earth working in order to keep their bodies in\ngood health; and they continued so until the nine months of Eve's\npregnancy were over, and the time drew near when she must give birth.",
        "74:2": "Then she said to Adam, \"The signs placed in this cave since we left\nthe garden indicate that this is a pure place and we will be praying in\nit again some time.  It is not appropriate then, that I should give\nbirth in it.  Let us instead go to the sheltering rock cave that was\nformed by the command of God when Satan threw a big rock down on us in\nan attempt to kill us with it.",
        "74:3": "Adam then took Eve to that cave.  When the time came for her to give\nbirth, she strained a lot.  Adam felt sorry, and he was very worried\nabout her because she was close to death and the words of God to her\nwere being fulfilled: \"In suffering shall you bear a child, and in\nsorrow shall you bring forth a child.\"",
        "74:4": "But when Adam saw the distress in which Eve was, he got up and prayed\nto God, and said, \"O Lord, look at me with the eye of Your mercy, and\nbring her out of her distress.\"",
        "74:5": "And God looked at His maid-servant Eve, and delivered her, and she\ngave birth to her first-born son, and with him a daughter.",
        "74:6": "The Adam rejoiced at Eve's deliverance, and also over the children\nshe had borne him.  And Adam ministered to Eve in the cave, until the\nend of eight days; when they named the son Cain, and the daughter\nLuluwa.",
        "74:7": "The meaning of Cain is \"hater,\" because he hated his sister in their\nmother's womb; before they came out of it.  Therefore Adam named him\nCain.",
        "74:8": "But Luluwa means \"beautiful,\" because she was more beautiful than her\nmother.",
        "74:9": "Then Adam and Eve waited until Cain and his sister were forty days\nold, when Adam said to Eve, \"We will make an offering and offer it up\nin behalf of the children.\"",
        "74:10": "And Eve said, \"We will make one offering for the first-born son and\nthen later we shall make one for the daughter.\"",
        "75:1": "Then Adam prepared an offering, and he and Eve offered it up for\ntheir children, and brought it to the altar they had built at first.",
        "75:2": "And Adam offered up the offering, and asked God to accept his\noffering.",
        "75:3": "Then God accepted Adam's offering, and sent a light from heaven that\nshown on the offering.  Adam and his son drew near to the offering, but\nEve and the daughter did not approach it.",
        "75:4": "Adam and his son were joyful as they came down from on the altar.\nAdam and Eve waited until the daughter was eighty days old, then Adam\nprepared an offering and took it to Eve and to the children. They went\nto the altar, where Adam offered it up, as he was accustomed, asking\nthe Lord to accept his offering.",
        "75:5": "And the Lord accepted the offering of Adam and Eve.  Then Adam, Eve,\nand the children, drew near together, and came down from the mountain,\nrejoicing.",
        "75:6": "But they returned not to the cave in which they were born; but came\nto the Cave of Treasures, in order that the children should go around\nin it, and be blessed with the tokens brought from the garden.",
        "75:7": "But after they had been blessed with these tokens, they went back to\nthe cave in which they were born.",
        "75:8": "However, before Eve had offered up the offering, Adam had taken her,\nand had gone with her to the river of water, in which they threw\nthemselves at first; and there they washed themselves.  Adam washed his\nbody and Eve hers also clean, after the suffering and distress that had\ncome over them.",
        "75:9": "But Adam and Eve, after washing themselves in the river of water,\nreturned every night to the Cave of Treasures, where they prayed and\nwere blessed; and then went back to their cave, where their children\nwere born.",
        "75:10": "Adam and Eve did this until the children had been weaned.  After\nthey were weaned, Adam made an offering for the souls of his children\nin addition to the three times every week he made an offering for them.",
        "75:11": "When the children were weaned, Eve again conceived, and when her\npregnancy came to term, she gave birth to another son and daughter.\nThey named the son Abel and the daughter Aklia.",
        "75:12": "Then at the end of forty days, Adam made an offering for the son,\nand at the end of eighty days he made another offering for the\ndaughter, and treated them, as he had previously treated Cain and his\nsister Luluwa.",
        "75:13": "He brought them to the Cave of Treasures, where they received a\nblessing, and then returned to the cave where they were born.  After\nthese children were born, Eve stopped having children.",
        "76:1": "And the children began to grow stronger and taller; but Cain was\nhard-hearted, and ruled over his younger brother.",
        "76:2": "Often when his father made an offering, Cain would remain behind and\nnot go with them, to offer up.",
        "76:3": "But, as to Abel, he had a meek heart, and was obedient to his father\nand mother.  He frequently moved them to make an offering, because he\nloved it.  He prayed and fasted a lot.",
        "76:4": "Then came this sign to Abel.  As he was coming into the Cave of\nTreasures, and saw the golden rods, the incense and the myrrh, he asked\nhis parents, Adam and Eve, to tell him about them and asked, \"Where did\nyou get these from?\"",
        "76:5": "Then Adam told him all that had befallen them.  And Abel felt deeply\nabout what his father told him.",
        "76:6": "Furthermore his father, Adam, told him of the works of God, and of\nthe garden.  After hearing that, Abel remained behind after his father\nleft and stayed the whole of that night in the Cave of Treasures.",
        "76:7": "And that night, while he was praying, Satan appeared to him under the\nfigure of a man, who said to him, \"You have frequently moved your\nfather into making offerings, fasting and praying, therefore I will\nkill you, and make you perish from this world.\"",
        "76:8": "But as for Abel, he prayed to God, and drove away Satan from him; and\ndid not believe the words of the devil.  Then when it was day, an angel\nof God appeared to him, who said to him, \"Do not cut short either\nfasting, prayer, or offering up an offering to your God.  For, look,\nthe Lord had accepted your prayer.  Be not afraid of the figure which\nappeared to you in the night, and who cursed you to death.\"  And the\nangel departed from him.",
        "76:9": "Then when it was day, Abel came to Adam and Eve, and told them of the\nvision he had seen.  When they heard it, they grieved much over it, but\nsaid nothing to him about it; they only comforted him.",
        "76:10": "But as to the hard-hearted Cain, Satan came to him by night, showed\nhimself and said to him, \"Since Adam and Eve love your brother Abel so\nmuch more than they love you, they wish to join him in marriage to your\nbeautiful sister because they love him.  However, they wish to join you\nin marriage to his ugly sister, because they hate you.",
        "76:11": "Now before they do that, I am telling you that you should kill your\nbrother. That way your sister will be left for you, and his sister will\nbe cast away.\"",
        "76:12": "And Satan departed from him.  But the devil remained behind in\nCain's heart, and frequently aspired to kill his brother.",
        "77:1": "But when Adam saw that the older brother hated the younger, he\nendeavored to soften their hearts, and said to Cain, \"O my son, take of\nthe fruits of your sowing and make an offering to God, so that He might\nforgive you for your wickedness and sin.\"",
        "77:2": "He said also to Abel, \"Take some of your sowing and make an offering\nand bring it to God, so that He might forgive you for your wickedness\nand sin.\"",
        "77:3": "Then Abel obeyed his father's voice, took some of his sowing, and\nmade a good offering, and said to his father, Adam, \"Come with me and\nshow me how to offer it up.\"",
        "77:4": "And they went, Adam and Eve with him, and they showed him how to\noffer up his gift on the altar.  Then after that, they stood up and\nprayed that God would accept Abel's offering.",
        "77:5": "Then God looked at Abel and accepted his offering.  And God was more\npleased with Abel than with his offering, because of his good heart and\npure body.  There was no trace of guile in him.",
        "77:6": "Then they came down from the altar, and went to the cave in which\nthey lived.  But Abel, by reason of his joy at having made his\noffering, repeated it three times a week, after the example of his\nfather Adam.",
        "77:7": "But as to Cain, he did not want to make an offering, but after his\nfather became very angry, he offered up a gift once.  He took the\nsmallest of his sheep for an offering and when he offered it up, his\neyes were on the lamb.",
        "77:8": "Therefore God did not accept his offering, because his heart was full\nof murderous thoughts.",
        "77:9": "And they all thus lived together in the cave in which Eve had brought\nforth, until Cain was fifteen years old, and Abel twelve years old.",
        "78:1": "Then Adam said to Eve, \"Behold the children are grown up; we must\nthink of finding wives for them.\"",
        "78:2": "Then Eve answered, \"How can we do it?\"",
        "78:3": "Then Adam said to her, \"We will join Abel's sister in marriage to\nCain, and Cain's sister to Abel.",
        "78:4": "The said Eve to Adam, \"I do not like Cain because he is hard-hearted;\nbut let them stay with us until we offer up to the Lord in their\nbehalf.\"",
        "78:5": "And Adam said no more.",
        "78:6": "Meanwhile Satan came to Cain in the figure of a man of the field, and\nsaid to him, \"Behold Adam and Eve have taken counsel together about the\nmarriage of you two; and they have agreed to marry Abel's sister to\nyou, and your sister to him.",
        "78:7": "But if it was not that I love you, I would not have told you this\nthing.  Yet if you will take my advice, and obey me, I will bring to\nyou on your wedding day beautiful robes, gold and silver in plenty, and\nmy relations will attend you.\"",
        "78:8": "Then Cain said with joy, \"Where are your relations?\"",
        "78:9": "And Satan answered, \"My relations are in a garden in the north, where\nI once meant to bring your father Adam; but he would not accept my\noffer.",
        "78:10": "But you, if you will receive my words and if you will come to me\nafter your wedding, you shall rest from the misery in which you are;\nand you shall rest and be better off than your father Adam.\"",
        "78:11": "At these words of Satan Cain opened his ears, and leaned towards his\nspeech.",
        "78:12": "And he did not remain in the field, but he went to Eve, his mother,\nand beat her, and cursed her, and said to her, \"Why are you planning to\ntake my sister to wed her to my brother?   Am I dead?\"",
        "78:13": "His mother, however, quieted him, and sent him to the field where he\nhad been.",
        "78:14": "Then when Adam came, she told him of what Cain had done.",
        "78:15": "But Adam grieved and held his peace, and said not a word.",
        "78:16": "Then on the next morning Adam said to Cain his son, \"Take of your\nsheep, young and good, and offer them up to your God; and I will speak\nto your brother, to make to his God an offering of corn.\"",
        "78:17": "They both obeyed their father Adam, and they took their offerings,\nand offered them up on the mountain by the altar.",
        "78:18": "But Cain behaved haughtily towards his brother, and shoved him from\nthe altar, and would not let him offer up his gift on the altar; but he\noffered his own on it, with a proud heart, full of guile, and fraud.",
        "78:19": "But as for Abel, he set up stones that were near at hand, and on\nthat, he offered up his gift with a heart humble and free from guile.",
        "78:20": "Cain was then standing by the altar on which he had offered up his\ngift; and he cried to God to accept his offering; but God did not\naccept it from him; neither did a divine fire come down to consume his\noffering.",
        "78:21": "But he remained standing over against the altar, out of humor and\nmeanness, looking towards his brother Abel, to see if God would accept\nhis offering or not.",
        "78:22": "And Abel prayed to God to accept his offering.  Then a divine fire\ncame down and consumed his offering.  And God smelled the sweet savor\nof his offering; because Abel loved Him and rejoice in Him.",
        "78:23": "And because God was well pleased with him, He sent him an angel of\nlight in the figure of a man who had partaken of his offering, because\nHe had smelled the sweet savor of his offering, and they comforted Abel\nand strengthened his heart.",
        "78:24": "But Cain was looking on all that took place at his brother's\noffering, and was angry because of it.",
        "78:25": "Then he opened his mouth and blasphemed God, because He had not\naccepted his offering.",
        "78:26": "But God said to cain, \"Why do you look sad?  Be righteous, that I\nmay accept your offering.  Not against Me have you murmured, but\nagainst yourself.",
        "78:27": "And God said this to Cain in rebuke, and because He abhorred him and\nhis offering.",
        "78:28": "And Cain came down from the altar, his color changed and with a sad\nface, and came to his father and mother and told them all that had\nbefallen him.  And Adam grieved much because God had not accepted\nCain's offering.",
        "78:29": "But Abel came down rejoicing, and with a gladsome heart, and told\nhis father and mother how God had accepted his offering.  And they\nrejoiced at it and kissed his face.",
        "78:30": "And Abel said to his father, \"Because Cain shoved me from the altar,\nand would not allow me to offer my gift on it, I made an altar for\nmyself and offered my gift on it.\"",
        "78:31": "But when Adam heard this he was very sorry, because it was the altar\nhe had built at first, and on which he had offered his own gifts.",
        "78:32": "As to Cain, he was so resentful and so angry that he went into the\nfield, where Satan came to him and said to him, \"Since your brother\nAbel has taken refuge with your father Adam, because you shoved him\nfrom the altar, they have kissed his face, and they rejoice over him,\nfar more than over you.\"",
        "78:33": "When Cain heard these words of  Satan, he was filled with rage; and\nhe let no one know.  But he was laying wait to kill his brother, until\nhe brought him into the cave, and then said to him:--",
        "78:34": "\"O brother, the country is so beautiful, and there are such\nbeautiful and pleasurable trees in it, and charming to look at!  But\nbrother, you have never been one day in the field to take your pleasure\nin that place.",
        "78:35": "Today, O, my brother, I very much wish you would come with me into\nthe field, to enjoy yourself and to bless our fields and our flocks,\nfor you are righteous, and I love you much, O my brother!  But you have\nalienated yourself from me.\"",
        "78:36": "Then Abel consented to go with his brother Cain into the field.",
        "78:37": "But before going out, Cain said to Abel, \"Wait for me, until I fetch\na staff, because of wild beasts.\"",
        "78:38": "Then Abel stood waiting in his innocence.  But Cain, the forward,\nfetched a staff and went out.",
        "78:39": "And they began, Cain and his brother Abel, to walk in the way; Cain\ntalking to him, and comforting him, to make him forget everything.",
        "79:1": "And so they went on, until they came to a lonely place, where there\nwere no sheep; then Abel said to Cain, \"Behold, my brother, we are\ntired from walking; for we see none of the trees, nor of the fruits,\nnor of the flourishing green plants, nor of the sheep, nor any one of\nthe things of which you told me.  Where are those sheep of thine you\ntold me to bless?\"",
        "79:2": "Then Cain said to him, \"Come on, and you shall see many beautiful\nthings very soon, but go before me, until I catch up to you.\"",
        "79:3": "Then went Abel forward, but Cain remained behind him.",
        "79:4": "And Abel was walking in his innocence, without guile; not believing\nhis brother would kill him.",
        "79:5": "Then Cain, when he came up to him, comforted him with his talk,\nwalking a little behind him; then he ran up to him and beat him with\nthe staff, blow after blow, until he was stunned.",
        "79:6": "But when Abel fell down on the ground, seeing that his brother meant\nto kill him, he said to Cain, \"O, my brother, have pity on me.  By the\nbreasts we have sucked, don't hit me!  By the womb that bore us and\nthat brought us into the world, don't beat me to death with that staff!\nIf you will kill me, take one of these large stones and kill me\noutright.\"",
        "79:7": "Then Cain, the hard-hearted, and cruel murderer, took a large stone,\nand beat his brother's head with it, until his brains oozed out, and he\nwallowed in his blood, before him.",

What then meaneth the parable of the fig-tree? We know it not.",

And the gardener said unto God: Suffer us to rid it of weeds and dig the ground round about it and water it. If then it bear not fruit, we will straightway remove its roots out of the garden and plant another in place of it. 4. Hast thou not understood that the fig-tree is the house of Israel? Verily I say unto thee, when the twigs thereof have sprouted forth in the last days, then shall feigned Christs come and awake expectation saying: I am the Christ, that am now come into the world. And when they shall perceive the wickedness of their deeds they shall turn away after them and deny him [whom our fathers did praise], even the first Christ whom they crucified and therein sinned a great sin. But this deceiver is not the Christ. And when they reject him he shall slay with the sword, and there shall be many martyrs. 5. Then shall the twigs of the fig-tree, that is, the house of Israel, shoot forth: many shall become martyrs at his hand. Enoch and Elias shall be sent to teach them that this is the deceiver which must come into the world and do signs and wonders to deceive.

Go forth therefore and go unto the land (or city) of the west and enter into the vineyard which I shall tell thee of, in order that by the sickness (sufferings) of the Son who is without sin the deeds of corruption may be sanctified. As for thee, thou art chosen according to the promise which I have given thee. Spread thou therefore my gospel throughout all the world in peace. Verily men shall rejoice: my words shall be the source of hope and of life, and suddenly shall the world be ravished.",
        "15:1": "And my Lord Jesus Christ our King said unto me: Let us go unto the holy mountain. And his disciples went with him, praying. And behold there were two men there, and we could not look upon their faces, for a light came from them, shining more than the sun, and their raiment also was shining, and cannot be described, and nothing is sufficient to be compared unto them in this world. And the sweetness of them . . . that no mouth is able to utter the beauty of their appearance, for their aspect was astonishing and wonderful. And the other, great, I say, shineth in his aspect above crystal. Like the flower of roses is the appearance of the colour of his aspect and of his body . . . his head. And upon his shoulders and on their foreheads was a crown of nard woven of fair flowers. As the rainbow in the water, so was their hair. And such was the comeliness of their countenance, adorned with all manner of ornament.",
        "16:1": "And when we saw them on a sudden, we marvelled. And I drew near unto the Lord (God) Jesus Christ and said unto him: O my Lord, who are these? And he said unto me: They are Moses and Elias. And I said unto him: Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and the rest of the righteous fathers? And he showed us a great garden, open, full of fair trees and blessed fruits, and of the odour of perfumes. The fragrance thereof was pleasant and came even unto us. And thereof . . . saw I much fruit. And my Lord and God Jesus Christ said unto me: Hast thou seen the companies of the fathers?",
        "16:2": "As is their rest, such also is the honour and the glory of them that are persecuted for my righteousness' sake. And I rejoiced and believed and understood that which is written in the book of my Lord Jesus Christ. And I said unto him: O my Lord, wilt thou that I make here three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias? And he said unto me in wrath: Satan maketh war against thee, and hath veiled thine understanding; and the good things of this world prevail against thee. Thine eyes therefore must be opened and thine ears unstopped that a tabernacle, not made with men's hands, which my heavenly Father hath made for me and for the elect. And we beheld it and were full of gladness.",
        "17:1": "And behold, suddenly there came a voice from heaven, saying: This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased: my commandments. And then came a great and exceeding white cloud over our heads and bare away our Lord and Moses and Elias. And I trembled and was afraid: and we looked up and the heaven opened and we beheld men in the flesh, and they came and greeted our Lord and Moses and Elias and went into another heaven. And the word of the scripture was fulfilled: This is the generation that seeketh him and seeketh the face of the God of Jacob. And great fear and commotion was there in heaven and the angels pressed one upon another that the word of the scripture might be fulfilled which saith: Open the gates, ye princes.",
        "17:2": "Thereafter was the heaven shut, that had been open.",
        "17:3": "And we prayed and went down from the mountain, glorifying God, which hath written the names of the righteous in heaven in the book of life."

He also continued to suck the thumb of his right hand every day. And the child grew thin, although he was very much loved by the king.",

        "1:5": "Now when I Solomon heard this, I entered the Temple of God, and prayed with all my soul, night and day, that the demon might be delivered into my hands, and that I might gain authority over him. And it came about through my prayer that grace was given to me from the Lord Sabaoth by Michael his archangel. [He brought me] a little ring, having a seal consisting of an engraved stone, and said to me: \"Take, O Solomon, king, son of David, the gift which the Lord God has sent thee, the highest Sabaoth. With it thou shalt lock up all demons of the earth, male and female; and with their help thou shalt build up Jerusalem. [But] thou [must] wear this seal of God.

        "1:17": "And when she was come, I said to her: \"Tell me who art thou?'' But she said to me: \"I am called Onoskelis, a spirit wrought ...[?shabtai/Saturn?], lurking upon the earth. There is a golden cave where I lie. But I have a place that ever shifts. At one time I strangle men with a noose; at another, I creep up from the nature to the arms [in marg: \"worms\"]. But my most frequent dwelling-places are the precipices, caves, ravines. Oftentimes, however, do I consort with men in the semblance of a woman, and above all with those of a dark skin. For they share my star with me; since they it is who privily or openly worship my star, without knowing that they harm themselves, and but whet my appetite for further mischief. For they wish to provide money by means of memory (commemoration?), but I supply a little to those who worship me fairly.\"",
        "1:18": "And I Solomon questioned her about her birth, and she replied: \"I was born of a voice untimely, the so-called echo of a man's ordure dropped in a wood.\"",
        "1:19": "And I said to her: \"Under what star dost thou pass?\" And she answered me: \"Under the star of the full moon, for the reason that the moon travels over most things.\" Then I said to her: \"And what angel is it that frustrates thee?\" And she said to me: \"He that in thee [or \"through thee\"] is reigning.\" And I thought that she mocked me, and bade a soldier strike her. But she cried aloud, and said: \"I am [subjected] to thee, O king, by the wisdom of God given to thee, and by the angel Joel.\"",
        "1:20": "So I commanded her to spin the hemp for the ropes used in the building of the house of God; and accordingly, when I had sealed and bound her, she was so overcome and brought to naught as to stand night and day spinning the hemp.",
        "1:21": "And I at once bade another demon to be led unto me; and instantly there approached me the demon Asmodeus, bound, and I asked him: \"Who art thou ?'' But he shot on me a glance of anger and rage, and said: \"And who art thou?'' And I said to him: \"Thus punished as thou art, answerest thou me?\" But he, with rage, said to me: \"But how shall I answer thee, for thou art a son of man; whereas I was born an angel's seed by a daughter of man, so that no word of our heavenly kind addressed to the earth-born can be overweening. Wherefore also my star is bright in heaven, and men call it, some the Wain, and some the dragon's child. I keep near unto this star. So ask me not many things; for thy kingdom also after a little time is to be disrupted, and thy glory is but for a season. And short will be thy tyranny over us; and then we shall again have free range over mankind, so as that they shall revere us as if we were gods, not knowing, men that they are, the names of the angels set over us.\"",
        "1:22": "And I Solomon, on hearing this, bound him more carefully, and ordered him to be flogged with thongs of ox-hide, and to tell me humbly what was his name and what his business. And he answered me thus: \"I am called Asmodeus among mortals, and my business is to plot against the newly wedded, so that they may not know one another. And I sever them utterly by many calamities, and I waste away the beauty of virgin women, and estrange their hearts.\"",
        "1:23": "And I said to him: \"Is this thy only business?\" And he answered me: \"I transport men into fits of madness and desire, when they have wives of their own, so that they leave them, and go off by night and day to others that belong to other men; with the result that they commit sin, and fall into murderous deeds.\"",
        "1:24": "And I adjured him by the name of the Lord Sabaôth, saying: \"Fear God, Asmodeus, and tell me by what angel thou art frustrated.\" But he said: \"By Raphael, the archangel that stands before the throne of God. But the liver and gall of a fish put me to flight, when smoked over ashes of the tamarisk.\" I again asked him, and said: \"Hide not aught from me. For I am Solomon, son of David, King of Israel. Tell me the name of the fish which thou reverest.\" And he answered: \"It is the Glanos by name, and is found in the rivers of Assyria; wherefore it is that I roam about in those parts.\"",
        "1:25": "And I said to him: \"Hast thou nothing else about thee, Asmodeus?\" And he answered: \"The power of God knoweth, which hath bound me with the indissoluble bonds of yonder one's seal, that whatever I have told thee is true. I pray thee, King Solomon, condemn me not to [go into] water.\" But I smiled, and said to him: \"As the Lord God of my fathers liveth, I will lay iron on thee to wear. But thou shalt also make the clay for the entire construction of the Temple, treading it down with thy feet.\" And I ordered them to give him ten water-jars to carry water in. And the demon groaned terribly, and did the work I ordered him to do. And this I did, because that fierce demon Asmodeus knew even the future. And I Solomon glorified God, who gave wisdom to me Solomon his servant. And the liver of the fish and its gall I hung on the spike of a reed, and burned it over Asmodeus because of his being so strong, and his unbearable malice was thus frustrated.",
        "1:26": "And I summoned again to stand before me Beelzeboul, the prince of demons, and I sat him down on a raised seat of honour, and said to him: \"Why art thou alone, prince of the demons?\" And he said to me: \"Because I alone am left of the angels of heaven that came down. For I was first angel in the first heaven being entitled Beelzeboul. And now I control all those who are bound in Tartarus. But I too have a child, and he haunts the Red Sea. And on any suitable occasion he comes up to me again, being subject to me; and reveals to me what he has done, and I support him.",
        "1:27": "I Solomon said unto him: \"Beelzeboul, what is thy employment?\" And he answered me: \"I destroy kings. I ally myself with foreign tyrants. And my own demons I set on to men, in order that the latter may believe in them and be lost. And the chosen servants of God, priests and faithful men, I excite unto desires for wicked sins, and evil heresies, and lawless deeds; and they obey me, and I bear them on to destruction. And I inspire men with envy, and [desire for] murder, and for wars and sodomy, and other evil things. And I will destroy the world.\"",
        "1:28": "So I said to him: \"Bring to me thy child, who is, as thou sayest, in the Red Sea.\" But he said to me: \"I will not bring him to thee. But there shall come to me another demon called Ephippas. Him will I bind, and he will bring him up from the deep unto me.\" And I said to him: \"How comes thy son to be in the depth of the sea, and what is his name? \"And he answered me: \"Ask me not, for thou canst not learn from me. However, he will come to thee by any command, and will tell thee openly.\"",
        "1:29": "I said to him: \"Tell me by what angel thou art frustrated.\" And he answered: \"By the holy and precious name of the Almighty God, called by the Hebrews by a row of numbers, of which the sum is 644, and among the Greeks it is Emmanuel. And if one of the Romans adjure me by the great name of the power Eleéth, I disappear at once.\"",
        "1:30": "I Solomon was astounded when I heard this; and I ordered him to saw up Theban marbles. And when he began to saw the marbles, the other demons cried out with a loud voice, howling because of their king Beelzeboul.",
        "1:31": "But I Solomon questioned him, saying: \"If thou wouldst gain a respite, discourse to me about the things in heaven.\" And Beelzeboul said: \"Hear, O king, if thou burn gum, and incense, and bulb of the sea, with nard and saffron, and light seven lamps in an earthquake, thou wilt firmly fix thy house. And if, being pure , thou light them at dawn in the sun alight, then wilt thou see the heavenly dragons, how they wind themselves along and drag the chariot of the sun.\"",
        "1:32": "And I Solomon, having heard this, rebuked him, and said: \"Silence for this present, and continue to saw the marbles as I commanded thee.\" And I Solomon praised God, and commanded another demon to present himself to me. And one came before me who carried his face high up in the air, but the rest of the spirit curled away like a snail. And it broke through the few soldiers, and raised also a terrible dust on the ground, and carried it upwards; and then again hurled it back to frighten us, and asked what questions I could ask as a rule. And I stood up, and spat on the ground in that spot, and sealed with the ring of God. And forthwith the dust-wind stopped. Then I asked him, saying: \"Who art thou, O wind?\" Then he once more shook up a dust, and answered me: \"What wouldst thou have, King Solomon?\" I answered him: \"Tell me what thou art called, and I would fain ask thee a question. But so far I give thanks to God who has made me wise to answer their evil plots.\"",
        "1:33": "But [the demon] answered me: \"I am the spirit of the ashes (Tephras).\" And I said to him: \"What is thy pursuit?\" And he said: \"I bring darkness on men, and set fire to fields; and I bring homesteads to naught. But most busy am I in summer. However, when I get an opportunity, I creep into corners of the wall, by night and day. For I am offspring of the great one, and nothing less.\" Accordingly I said to him: \"Under what star dost thou lie?\" And he answered: \"In the very tip of the moon's horn, when it is found in the south. There is my star. For I have been bidden to restrain the convulsions of the hemitertian fever; and this is why many men pray to the hemitertian fever, using these three names: Bultala, Thallal, Melchal. And I heal them.\" And I said to him: \"I am Solomon; when therefore thou wouldst do harm, by whose aid dost thou do it?\" But he said to me: \"By the angel's, by whom also the third day's fever is lulled to rest.\" So I questioned him, and said: \"And by what name?\" And he answered: \"That of the archangel Azael.\" And I summoned the archangel Azael, and set a seal on the demon, and commanded him to seize great stones, and toss them up to the workmen on the higher parts of the Temple. And, being compelled, the demon began to do what he was bidden to do.",
        "1:34": "And I glorified God afresh who gave me this authority, and ordered another demon to come before me. And there came seven spirits, females, bound and woven together, fair in appearance and comely. And I Solomon, seeing them, questioned them and said: \"Who are ye?\" But they, with one accord, said with one voice: \"We are of the thirty-three elements of the cosmic ruler of the darkness.\" And the first said: \"I am Deception.\" The second said: \"I am Strife.\" The third: \"I am Klothod, which is battle.\" The fourth: \"I am Jealousy.\" The fifth: \"I am Power.\" The sixth: \"I am Error.\" The seventh: \"I am the worst of all, and our stars are in heaven. Seven stars humble in sheen, and all together. And we are called as it were goddesses. We change our place all and together, and together we live, sometimes in Lydia, sometimes in Olympus, sometimes in a great mountain.\"",
        "1:35": "So I Solomon questioned them one by one, beginning with the first, and going down to the seventh. The first said: \"I am Deception, I deceive and weave snares here and there. I whet and excite heresies. But I have an angel who frustrates me, Lamechalal.\"",
        "1:36": "Likewise also the second said: \"I am Strife, strife of strifes. I bring timbers, stones, hangers, my weapons on the spot. But I have an angel who frustrates me, Baruchiachel.\"",
        "1:37": "Likewise also the third said: \"I am called Klothod , which is Battle, and I cause the well-behaved to scatter and fall foul one of the other. And why do I say so much? I have an angel that frustrates me: \"Marmarath.\"",
        "1:38": "Likewise also the fourth said: \"I cause men to forget their sobriety and moderation. I part them and split them into parties; for Strife follows me hand in hand. I rend the husband from the sharer of his bed, and children from parents, and brothers from sisters. But why tell so much to my despite? I have an angel that frustrates me, the great Balthial.\"",
        "1:39": "Likewise also the fifth said: \"I am Power. By power I raise up tyrants and tear down kings. To all rebels I furnish power. I have an angel that frustrates me, Asteraôth.\"",
        "1:40": "Likewise also the sixth said: \"I am Error, O King Solomon. And I will make thee to err, as I have before made thee to err, when I caused thee to slay thy own brother. I will lead you into error, so as to pry into graves; and I teach them that dig, and I lead errant souls away from all piety, and many other evil traits are mine. But I have an angel that frustrates me, Uriel.\"",
        "1:41": "Likewise also the seventh said: \"I am the worst, and I make thee worse off than thou wast; because I will impose the bonds of Artemis. But the locust will set me free, for by means thereof is it fated that thou shalt achieve my desire [...]. For if one were wise, he would not turn his steps toward me.\"",
        "1:42": "So I Solomon, having heard and wondered, sealed them with my ring; and since they were so considerable, I bade them dig the foundations of the Temple of God. For the length of it was 250 cubits. And I bade them be industrious, and with one murmur of joint protest they began to perform the tasks enjoined.",
        "1:43": "But I Solomon glorified the Lord, and bade another demon come before me. And there was brought to me a demon having all the limbs of a man, but without a head. And I, seeing him, said to him: \"Tell me, who art thou?'' And he answered: \"I am a demon.\" So I said to him: \"Which?\" And he answered me: \"I am called Envy. For I delight to devour heads, being desirous to secure for myself a head; but I do not eat enough, but am anxious to have such a head as thou hast.\"",
        "1:44": "I Solomon, on hearing this, sealed him, stretching out my hand against his chest. Whereon the demon leapt up, and threw himself down, and gave a groan, saying: \"Woe is me! where am I come to? O traitor Ornias, I cannot see!\" So I said to him: \"I am Solomon. Tell me then how thou dost manage to see.\" And he answered me: \"By means of my feelings.\" I then, Solomon, having heard his voice come up to me, asked him how he managed to speak. And he answered me: \"I, O King Solomon, am wholly voice, for I have inherited the voices of many men. For in the case of all men who are called dumb, I it is who smashed their heads, when they were children and had reached their eighth day. Then when a child is crying in the night, I become a spirit, and glide by means of his voice [...]. In the crossways also I have many services to render, and my encounter is fraught with harm. For I grasp in all instant a man's head, and with my hands, as with a sword, I cut it off, and put it on to myself. And in this way, by means of the fire which is in me, through my neck it is swallowed up. I it is that sends grave mutilations and incurable on men's feet, and inflict sores.\"",
        "1:45": "And I Solomon, on hearing this, said to him: \"Tell me how thou dost discharge forth the fire? Out of what sources dost thou emit it?\" And the spirit said to me: \"From the Day-star. For here hath not yet been found that Elburion, to whom men offer prayers and kindle lights. And his name is invoked by the seven demons before me. And he cherishes them.\"",
        "1:46": "But I said to him: \"Tell me his name.\" But he answered: \"I cannot tell thee. For if I tell his name, I render myself incurable. But he will come in response to his name.\" And on hearing this, I Solomon said to him: \"Tell me then, by what angel thou art frustrated?\" And he answered: \"By the fiery flash of lightning.\" And I bowed myself before the Lord God of Israel, and bade him remain in the keeping of Beelzeboul until Iax should come.",
        "1:47": "Then I ordered another demon to come before me, and there came into my presence a hound, having a very large shape, and it spoke with a loud voice, and said, \"Hail, Lord, King Solomon!\" And I Solomon was astounded. I said to it: Who art thou, O hound?\" And it answered: \"I do indeed seem to thee to be a hound, but before thou wast, O King Solomon, I was a man that wrought many unholy deeds on earth. I was surpassingly learned in letters, and was so mighty that I could hold the stars of heaven back. And many divine works did I prepare. For I do harm to men who follow after our star, and turn them to [...]. And I seize the frenzied men by the larynx, and so destroy them.\"",
        "1:48": "And I Solomon said to him: \"What is thy name?\" And he answered: ''Staff\" (Rabdos). And I said to him: \"What is thine employment? And what results canst thou achieve?\" And he replied: ''Give me thy man, and I will lead him away into a mountainous spot, and will show him a green stone tossed to and fro, with which thou mayest adorn the temple of the Lord God.\"",
        "1:49": "And I Solomon, on hearing this, ordered my servant to set off with him, and to take the finger-ring bearing the seal of God with him. And I said to him: \"Whoever shall show thee the green stone, seal him with this finger-ring. And mark the spot with care, and bring me the demon hither. And the demon showed him the green stone, and he sealed it, and brought the demon to me. And I Solomon decided to confine with my seal on my right hand the two, the headless demon, likewise the hound, that was so huge; he should be bound as well. And I bade the hound keep safe the fiery spirit so that lamps as it were might by day and night cast their light through its maw on the artisans at work.",
        "1:50": "And I Solomon took from the mine of that stone 200 shekels for the supports of the table of incense, which was similar in appearance. And I Solomon glorified the Lord God, and then closed round the treasure of that stone. And I ordered afresh the demons to cut marble for the construction of the house of God. And I Solomon prayed to the Lord, and asked the hound, saying: \"By what angel art thou frustrated?\" And the demon replied: \"By the great Brieus.\"",
        "1:51": "And I praised the Lord God of heaven and earth, and bade another demon come forward to me; and there came before me one in the form of a lion roaring. And he stood and answered me saying: \"O king, in the form which I have, I am a spirit quite incapable of being perceived. Upon all men who lie prostrate with sickness I leap, coming stealthily along; and I render the man weak, so that his habit of body is enfeebled. But I have also another glory, O king. I cast out demons, and I have legions under my control. And I am capable of being received in my dwelling-places, along with all the demons belonging to the legions under me.\" But I Solomon, on hearing this, asked him: \"What is thy name?\" But he answered: \"Lionbearer, Rath in kind.\" And I said to him: \"How art thou to be frustrated along with thy legions? What angel is it that frustrates thee?\" And he answered: \"If I tell thee my name, I bind not myself alone, but also the legions of demons under me.\"",
        "1:52": "So I said to him: \"I adjure thee in the name of the God Sabaoth, to tell me by what name thou art frustrated along with thy host.\" And the spirit answered me: \"The 'great among men,' who is to suffer many things at the hands of men, whose name is the figure 644, which is Emmanuel; he it is who has bound us, and who will then come and plunge us from the steep under water. He is noised abroad in the three letters which bring him down.\"",
        "1:53": "And I Solomon, on hearing this, glorified God, and condemned his legion to carry wood from the thicket. And I condemned the lion-shaped one himself to saw up the wood small with his teeth, for burning in the unquenchable furnace for the Temple of God.",
        "1:54": "And I worshipped the Lord God of Israel, and bade another demon come forward. And there came before me a dragon, three-headed, of fearful hue. And I questioned him: \"Who art thou?\" And he answered me: \"I am a caltrop-like spirit, whose activity in three lines. But I blind children in women's wombs, and twirl their ears round. And I make them deaf and mute. And I have again in my third head means of slipping in. And I smite men in the limbless part of the body, and cause them to fall down, and foam, and grind their teeth. But I have my own way of being frustrated, Jerusalem being signified in writing, unto the place called 'of the head.\" For there is fore-appointed the angel of the great counsel, and now he will openly dwell on the cross.

        "1:55": "\"But in the place where thou sittest, O King Solomon, standeth a column in the air, of purple... The demon called Ephippas hath brought [it] up from the Red Sea, from inner Arabia. He it is that shall be shut up in a skin-bottle and brought before thee. But at the entrance of the Temple, which thou hast begun to build, O King Solomon, lies stored much gold, which dig thou up and carry off.\" And I Solomon sent my servant, and found it to be as the demon told me. And I sealed him with my ring, and praised the Lord God.\"",
        "1:56": "So I said to him: \"What art thou called?\" And the demon said: \"I am the crest of dragons.\" And I bade him make bricks in the Temple. He had human hands.",
        "1:57": "And I adored the Lord God of Israel, and bade another demon present himself. And there came before me a spirit in woman's form, that had a head without any limbs, and her hair was dishevelled. And I said to her: \"Who art thou?\" But she answered: \"Nay, who art thou? And why dost thou want to hear concerning me? But, as thou wouldst learn, here I stand bound before thy face. Go then into thy royal storehouses and wash thy hands. Then sit down afresh before thy tribunal, and ask me questions; and thou shalt learn, O king, who I am.\"",
        "1:58": "And I Solomon did as she enjoined me, and restrained myself because of the wisdom dwelling in me; in order that I might hear of her deeds, and reprehend them, and manifest them to men.

And divining the hour I take my stand; and if I am lucky, I strangle the child. But if not, I retire to another place. For I cannot for a single night retire unsuccessful. For I am a fierce spirit, of myriad names and many shapes. And now hither, now thither I roam. And to westering parts I go my rounds. But as it now is, though thou hast sealed me round with the ring of God, thou hast done nothing. I am not standing before thee, and thou wilt not be able to command me. For I have no work other than the destruction of children, and the making their ears to be deaf, and the working of evil to their eyes, and the binding their mouths with a bond, and the ruin of their minds, and paining of their bodies.\"",
        "1:59": "When I Solomon heard this, I marvelled at her appearance, for I beheld all her body to be in darkness. But her glance was altogether bright and greeny, and her hair was tossed wildly like a dragon's; and the whole of her limbs were invisible. And her voice was very clear as it came to me. And I cunningly said: \"Tell me by what angel thou art frustrated, O evil spirit?\" By she answered me: \"By the angel of God called Afarôt, which is interpreted Raphael, by whom I am frustrated now and for all time. His name, if any man know it, and write the same on a woman in childbirth, then I shall not be able to enter her. Of this name the number is 640.\" And I Solomon having heard this, and having glorified the Lord, ordered her hair to be bound, and that she should be hung up in front of the Temple of God; that all the children of Israel, as they passed, might see it, and glorify the Lord God of Israel, who had given me this authority, with wisdom and power from God, by means of this signet.",
        "1:60": "And I again ordered another demon to come before me. And the came, rolling itself along, one in appearance like to a dragon, but having the face and hands of a man. And all its limbs, except the feet, were those of a dragon; and it had wings on its back. And when I beheld it, I was astonied, and said: \"Who art thou, demon, and what art thou called? And whence hast thou come? Tell me.\"",
        "1:61": "And the spirit answered and said: \"This is the first time I have stood before the, O King Solomon. I am a spirit made into a god among men, but now brought to naught by the ring and wisdom vouchsafed to thee by God. Now I am the so-called winged dragon, and I chamber not with many women, but only with a few that are of fair shape, which possess the name of xuli, of this star. And I pair with them in the guise of a spirit winged in form, coitum habens per nates. And she on whom I have leapt goes heavy with child, and that which is born of her becomes eros. But since such offspring cannot be carried by men, the woman in question breaks wind. Such is my role. Supposed then only that I am satisfied, and all the other demons molested and disturbed by thee will speak the whole truth. But those composed of fire will cause to be burned up by fire the material of the logs which is to be collected by them for the building in the Temple.\"",
        "1:62": "And as the demon said this, I saw the spirit going forth from his mouth, and it consumed the wood of the frankincense-tree, and burned up all the logs which we had placed in the Temple of God. And I Solomon saw what the spirit had done, and I marvelled.",
        "1:63": "And, having glorified God, I asked the dragon-shaped demon, and said: \"Tell me, by what angel art thou frustrated?\" And he answered: \"By the great angel which has its seat in the second heaven, which is called in Hebrew Bazazeth. And I Solomon, having heard this, and having invoked his angel, condemned him to saw up marbles for the building of the Temple of God; and I praised God, and commanded another demon to come before me.",
        "1:64": "And there came before my face another spirit, as it were a woman in the form she had. But on her shoulders she had two other heads with hands. And I asked her, and said: \"Tell me, who art thou?\" And she said to me: \"I am Enêpsigos, who also have a myriad names.\" And I said her: \"By what angel art thou frustrated?\" But she said to me: \"What seekest, what askest thou? I undergo changes, like the goddess I am called. And I change again, and pass into possession of another shape. And be not desirous therefore to know all that concerns me. But since thou art before me for this much, hearken. I have my abode in the moon, and for that reason I possess three forms. At times I am magically invoked by the wise as Kronos. At other times, in connexion with those who bring me down, I come down and appear in another shape. The measure of the element is inexplicable and indefinable, and not to be frustrated. I then, changing into these three forms, come down and become such as thou seest me; but I am frustrated by the angel Rathanael, who sits in the third heaven. This then is why I speak to thee. Yonder temple cannot contain me.\"",
        "1:65": "I therefore Solomon prayed to my God, and I invoked the angel of whom Enépsigos spoke to me, and used my seal. And I sealed her with a triple chain, and (placed) beneath her the fastening of the chain. I used the seal of God, and the spirit prophesied to me, saying: \"This is what thou, King Solomon, doest to us. But after a time thy kingdom shall be broken, and again in season this Temple shall be riven asunder; and all Jerusalem shall be undone by the King of the Persians and Medes and Chaldaeans. And the vessels of this Temple, which thou makest, shall be put to servile uses of the gods; and along with them all the jars, in which thou dost shut us up, shall be broken by the hands of men. And then we shall go forth in great power hither and thither, and be disseminated all over the world. And we shall lead astray the inhabited world for a long season, until the Son of God is stretched upon the cross. For never before doth arise a king like unto him, one frustrating us all, whose mother shall not have contact with man. Who else can receive such authority over spirits, except he, whom the first devil will seek to tempt, but will not prevail over? The number of his name is 644, which is Emmanuel. Wherefore, O King Solomon, thy time is evil, and thy years short and evil, and to thy servant shall thy kingdom be given.\"",
        "1:66": "And I Solomon, having heard this, glorified God. And though I marvelled at the apology of the demons, I did not credit it until it came true. And I did not believe their words; but when they were realized, then I understood, and at my death I wrote this Testament to the children of Israel, and gave it to them, so that they might know the powers of the demons and their shapes, and the names of their angels, by which these angels are frustrated. And I glorified the Lord God of Israel, and commanded the spirits to be bound with bonds indissoluble.",
        "1:67": "And having praised God, I commanded another spirit to come before me; and there came before my face another demon, having in front the shape of a horse, but behind of a fish. And he had a mighty voice, and said to me: \"O King Solomon, I am a fierce spirit of the sea, and I am greedy of gold and silver. I am such a spirit as rounds itself and comes over the expanses of the water of the sea, and I trip up the men who sail thereon. For I round myself into a wave, and transform myself, and then throw myself on ships and come right in on them. And that is my business, and my way of getting hold of money and men. For I take the men, and whirl them round with myself, and hurl the men out of the sea. For I am not covetous of men's bodies, but cast them up out of the sea so far. But since Beelzeboul, ruler of the spirits of air and of those under the earth, and lord of earthly ones, hath a joint kingship with us in respect of the deeds of each one of us, therefore I went up from the sea, to get a certain outlook in his company.",
        "1:68": "\"But I also have another character and role. I metamorphose myself into waves, and come up from the sea. And I show myself to men, so that those on earth call me Kuno[s]paston, because I assume the human form. And my name is a true one. For by my passage up into men, I send forth a certain nausea. I came then to take counsel with the prince Beelzeboul; and he bound me and delivered me into thy hands. And I am here before thee because of this seal, and thou dost now torment me. Behold now, in two or three days the spirit that converseth with thee will fail, because I shall have no water.\"",
        "1:69": "And I said to him: \"Tell me by what angel thou art frustrated.\" And he answered: \"By Iameth.\" And I glorified God. I commanded the spirit to be thrown into a phial along with ten jugs of sea-water of two measures each. And I sealed them round above the marbles and asphalt and pitch in the mouth of the vessel. And having sealed it with my ring, I ordered it to be deposited in the Temple of God. And I ordered another spirit to come before me.",
        "1:70": "And there came before my face another enslaved spirit, having obscurely the form of a man, with gleaming eyes, and bearing in his hand a blade. And I asked: \"Who art thou? But he answered: \"I am a lascivious spirit, engendered of a giant man who dies in the massacre in the time of the giants.\" I said to him: \"Tell me what thou art employed on upon earth, and where thou hast thy dwelling.\"",
        "1:71": "And he said: \"My dwelling is in fruitful places, but my procedure is this. I seat myself beside the men who pass along among the tombs, and in untimely season I assume the form of the dead; and if I catch any one, I at once destroy him with my sword. But if I cannot destroy him, I cause him to be possessed with a demon, and to devour his own flesh, and the hair to fall off his chin.\" But I said to him: \"Do thou then be in fear of the God of heaven and of earth, and tell me by angel thou art frustrated.\" And he answered: \"He destroys me who is to become Saviour, a man whose number, if any one shall write it on his forehead, he will defeat me, and in fear I shall quickly retreat. And, indeed, if any one write this sign on him, I shall be in fear.\" And I Solomon, on hearing this, and having glorified the Lord God, shut up this demon like the rest.",
        "1:72": "And I commanded another demon to come before me. And there came before my face thirty-six spirits, their heads shapeless like dogs, but in themselves they were human in form; with faces of asses, faces of oxen, and faces of birds. And I Solomon, on hearing and seeing them, wondered, and I asked them and said: \"Who are you?\" But they, of one accord with one voice, said: \"We are the thirty-six elements, the world-rulers of this darkness. But, O King Solomon, thou wilt not wrong us nor imprison us, nor lay command on us; but since the Lord God has given thee authority over every spirit, in the air, and on the earth, and under the earth, therefore do we also present ourselves before thee like the other spirits, from ram and bull, from both twin and crab, lion and virgin, scales and scorpion, archer, goat-horned, waterpourer, and fish.",
        "1:73": "Then I Solomon invoked the name of the Lord Sabaoth, and questioned each in turn as to what was its character. And I bade each one come forward and tell of its actions. Then the first one came forward, and said: \"I am the first decans of the zodiacal circle, and I am called the ram, and with me are these two.\" So I put to them the question: \"Who are ye called?\" The first said: \"I, O Lord, am called Ruax, and I cause the heads of men to be idle, and I pillage their brows. But let me only hear the words, 'Michael, imprison Ruax,' and at once I retreat.\"",

And I furthermore prayed to the Lord God to cause the demons without, that hamper humanity, to be bound and made to approach the Temple of God. Some of these demons I condemned to do the heavy work of the construction of the Temple of God. Others I shut up in prisons. Others I ordered to wrestle with fire in (the making of) gold and silver, sitting down by lead and spoon. And to make ready places for the other demons in which they should be confined.",

And my kingdom was prosperous, and my army was with me. And for the rest the city of Jerusalem had repose, rejoicing and delighted. And all the kings of the earth came to me from the ends of the earth to behold the Temple which I builded to the Lord God. And having heard of the wisdom given to me, they did homage to me in the Temple, bringing gold and silver and precious stones, many and divers, and bronze, and iron, and lead, and cedar logs. And woods decay not they brought me, for the equipment of the Temple of God.",

And all the sons of Israel glorified God.",
        "1:110": "And behold, in those days one of the workmen, of ripe old age, threw himself down before me, and said: \"King Solomon, pity me, because I am old.\" So I bade him stand up, and said: \"Tell me, old man, all you will.\" And he answered: \"I beseech you king, I have an only-born son, and he insults and beats me openly, and plucks out the hair of my head, and threatens me with a painful death. Therefore I beseech you avenge me.",

And the youth said: \"I was not so filled with madness as to strike my father with my hand. Be kind to me, O king. For I have not dared to commit such impiety, poor wretch that I am.\" But I Solomon on hearing this from the youth, exhorted the old man to reflect on the matter, and accept his son's apology. However, he would not, but said he would rather let him die. And as the old man would not yield, I was about to pronounce sentence on the youth, when I saw Ornias the demon laughing. I was very angry at the demon's laughing in my presence; and I ordered my men to remove the other parties, and bring forward Ornias before my tribunal. And when he was brought before me, I said to him: \"Accursed one, why didst thou look at me and laugh?\" And the demon answered: \"Prithee, king, it was not because of thee I laughed, but because of this ill-starred old man and the wretched youth, his son. For after three days his son will die untimely; and lo, the old man desires to foully make away with him.\"",
        "1:112": "But I Solomon, having heard this, said to the demon: \"Is that true that thou speakest?\" And he answered: \"It is true; O king.\" And I, on hearing that, bade them remove the demon, and that they should again bring before me the old man with his son. I bade them make friends with one another again, and I supplied them with food. And then I told the old man after three days to bring his son again to me here; \"and,\" said I, \"I will attend to him.\" And they saluted me, and went their way.",
        "1:113": "And when they were gone I ordered Ornias to be brought forward, and said to him: \"Tell me how you know this;\" and he answered: \"We demons ascend into the firmament of heaven, and fly about among the stars. And we hear the sentences which go forth upon the souls of men, and forthwith we come, and whether by force of influence, or by fire, or by sword, or by some accident, we veil our act of destruction; and if a man does not die by some untimely disaster or by violence, then we demons transform ourselves in such a way as to appear to men and be worshipped in our human nature.\"",
        "1:114": "I therefore, having heard this, glorified the Lord God, and again I questioned the demon, saying: \"Tell me how ye can ascend into heaven, being demons, and amidst the stars and holy angels intermingle.\" And he answered: \"Just as things are fulfilled in heaven, so also on earth (are fulfilled) the types of all of them. For there are principalities, authorities, world-rulers, and we demons fly about in the air; and we hear the voices of the heavenly beings, and survey all the powers. And as having no ground (basis) on which to alight and rest, we lose strength and fall off like leaves from trees. And men seeing us imagine that the stars are falling from heaven. But it is not really so, O king; but we fall because of our weakness, and because we have nowhere anything to lay hold of; and so we fall down like lightnings in the depth of night and suddenly. And we set cities in flames and fire the fields. For the stars have firm foundations in the heavens like the sun and the moon.\"",
        "1:115": "And I Solomon, having heard this, ordered the demon to be guarded for five days. And after the five days I recalled the old man, and was about to question him. But he came to me in grief and with black face. And I said to him: \"Tell me, old man, where is thy son? And what means this garb?\" And he answered: \"Lo, I am become childless, and sit by my son's grave in despair. For it is already two days that he is dead.\" But I Solomon, on hearing that, and knowing that the demon Ornias had told me the truth, glorified the God of Israel.",
        "1:116": "And the queen of the South saw all this, and marvelled, glorifying the God of Israel; and she beheld the Temple of the Lord being builded. And she gave a siklos of gold and one hundred myriads of silver and choice bronze, and she went into the Temple. And (she beheld) the altar of incense and the brazen supports of this altar, and the gems of the lamps flashing forth of different colours, and of the lampstand of stone, and of emerald, and hyacinth, and sapphire; and she beheld the vessels of gold, and silver, and bronze, and wood, and the folds of skins dyed red with madder. And she saw the bases of the pillars of the Temple of the Lord. All were of one gold ... apart from the demons whom I condemned to labour. And there was peace in the circle of my kingdom and over all the earth.",
        "1:117": "And it came to pass, which I was in my kingdom, the King of the Arabians, Adares, sent me a letter, and the writing of the letter was written as follows: -\"To King Solomon, all hail! Lo, we have heard, and it hath been heard unto all the ends of the earth, concerning the wisdom vouchsafed in thee, and that thou art a man merciful from the Lord. And understanding hath been granted thee over all the spirits of the air, and on earth, and under the earth. Now, forasmuch as there is present in the land of Arabia a spirit of the following kind: at early dawn there begins to blow a certain wind until the third hour. And its blast is harsh and terrible, and it slays man and beast. And no spirit can live upon earth against this demon. I pray thee then, forasmuch as the spirit is a wind, contrive something according to the wisdom given in thee by the Lord thy God, and deign to send a man able to capture it. And behold, King Solomon, I and my people and all my land will serve thee unto death. And all Arabia shall be at peace with thee, if thou wilt perform this act of righteousness for us. Wherefore we pray thee, contemn not our humble prayer, and suffer not to be utterly brought to naught the eparchy subordinated to thy authority. Because we are suppliants, both I and my people and all my land. Farewell to my Lord. All health!\"",
        "1:118": "And I Solomon read this epistle; and I folded it up and gave it to my people, and said to them: \"After seven days shalt thou remind me of this epistle. And Jerusalem was built, and the Temple was being completed. And there was a stone, the end stone of the corner lying there, great, chosen out, one which I desired lay in the head of the corner of the completion of the Temple. And all the workmen, and all the demons helping them came to the same place to bring up the stone and lay it on the pinnacle of the holy Temple, and were not strong enough to stir it, and lay it upon the corner allotted to it. For that stone was exceedingly great and useful for the corner of the Temple.\"",
        "1:119": "And after seven days, being reminded of the epistle of Adares, King of Arabia, I called my servant and said to him: \"Order thy camel and take for thyself a leather flask, and take also this seal. And go away into Arabia to the place in which the evil spirit blows; and there take the flask, and the signet-ring in front of the mouth of the flask, and (hold them) towards the blast of the spirit. And when the flask is blown out, thou wilt understand that the demon is (in it). Then hastily tie up the mouth of to flask, and seal it securely with the seal-ring, and lay it carefully on the camel and bring it me hither. And if on the way it offer thee gold or silver or treasure in return for letting it go, see that thou be not persuaded. But arrange without using oath to release it. And then if it point out to the places where are gold or silver, mark the places and seal them with this seal. And bring the demon to me. And now depart, and fare thee well.\"",
        "1:120": "Then the youth did as was bidden him. And he ordered his camel, and laid on it a flask, and set off into Arabia. And the men of that region would not believe that he would be able to catch the evil spirit. And when it was dawn, the servant stood before the spirit's blast, and laid the flask on the ground, and the finger-ring on the mouth of the flask. And the demon blew through the middle of the finger-ring into the mouth of the flask, and going in blew out the flask. But the man promptly stood up to it and drew tight with his hand the mouth of the flask, in the name of the Lord God of Sabaôth. And the demon remained within the flask. And after that the youth remained in that land three days to make trial. And the spirit no longer blew against that city. And all the Arabs knew that he had safely shut in the spirit.",
        "1:121": "Then the youth fastened the flask on the camel, and the Arabs sent him forth on his way with much honour and precious gifts, praising and magnifying the God of Israel. But the youth brought in the bag and laid it in the middle of the Temple. And on the next day, I King Solomon, went into the Temple of God and sat in deep distress about the stone of the end of the corner. And when I entered the Temple, the flask stood up and walked around some seven steps and then fell on its mouth and did homage to me. And I marvelled that even along with the bottle the demon still had power and could walk about; and I commanded it to stand up. And the flask stood up, and stood on its feet all blown out. And I questioned him, saying: \"Tell me, who art thou?\" And the spirit within said: \"I am the demon called Ephippas, that is in Arabia.\" And I said to him: \"Is this thy name?\" And he answered: \"Yes; wheresoever I will, I alight and set fire and do to death.\"",
        "1:122": "And I said to him: \"By what angel art thou frustrated?\" And he answered: \"By the only-ruling God, that hath authority over me even to be heard. He that is to be born of a virgin and crucified by the Jews on a cross. Whom the angels and archangels worship. He doth frustrate me, and enfeeble me of my great strength, which has been given me by my father the devil.\" And I said to him: \"What canst thou do?'' And he answered: ''I am able to remove mountains, to overthrow the oaths of kings. I wither trees and make their leaves to fall off.\" And I said to him: \"Canst thou raise this stone, and lay it for the beginning of this corner which exists in the fair plan of the Temple?'' And he said: \"Not only raise this, O king; but also, with the help of the demon who presides over the Red Sea, I will bring up the pillar of air, and will stand it where thou wilt in Jerusalem.''",
        "1:123": "Saying this, I laid stress on him, and the flask became as if depleted of air. And I placed it under the stone, and (the spirit) girded himself up, and lifted it up top of the flask. And the flask went up the steps, carrying the stone, and laid it down at the end of the entrance of the Temple. And I Solomon, beholding the stone raised aloft and placed on a foundation, said: \"Truly the Scripture is fulfilled, which says: 'The stone which the builders rejected on trial, that same is become the head of the corner.' For this it is not mine to grant, but God's, that the demon should be strong enough to lift up so great a stone and deposit it in the place I wished.\"",
        "1:124": "And Ephippas led the demon of the Red Sea with the column. And they both took the column and raised it aloft from the earth. And I outwitted these two spirits, so that they could not shake the entire earth in a moment of time. And then I sealed round with my ring on this side and that, and said: \"Watch.\" And the spirits have remained upholding it until this day, for proof of the wisdom vouchsafed to me. And there the pillar was hanging of enormous size, in mid air, supported by the winds. And thus the spirits appeared underneath, like air, supporting it. And if one looks fixedly, the pillar is a little oblique, being supported by the spirits; and it is so to day.",
        "1:125": "And I Solomon questioned the other spirit which came up with the pillar from the depth of the Red Sea. And I said to him: \"Who art thou, and what calls thee? And what is thy business? For I hear many things about thee.'' And the demon answered: \"I, O King Solomon, am called Abezithibod. I am a descendant of the archangel. Once as I sat in the first heaven, of which the name is Ameleouth -- I then am a fierce spirit and winged, and with a single wing, plotting against every spirit under heaven. I was present when Moses went in before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and I hardened his heart. I am he whom Iannes and Iambres invoked homing with Moses in Egypt. I am he who fought against Moses with wonders with signs.\"",
        "1:126": "I said therefore to him: \"How wast thou found in the Red Sea?\" And he answered: \"In the exodus of the sons of Israel I hardened the heart of Pharaoh. And I excited his heart and that of his ministers. And I caused them to pursue after the children of Israel. And Pharaoh followed with (me) and all the Egyptians. Then I was present there, and we followed together. And we all came up upon the Red Sea. And it came to pass when the children of Israel had crossed over, the water returned and hid all the host of the Egyptians and all their might. And I remained in the sea, being kept under this pillar. But when Ephippas came, being sent by thee, shut up in the vessel of a flask, he fetched me up to thee.\"",
        "1:127": "I, therefore, Solomon, having heard this, glorified God and adjured the demons not to disobey me, but to remain supporting the pillar. And they both sware, saying: \"The Lord thy God liveth, we will not let go this pillar until the world's end. But on whatever day this stone fall, then shall be the end of the world.\"",
        "1:128": "And I Solomon glorified God, and adorned the Temple of the Lord with all fair-seeming. And I was glad in spirit in my kingdom, and there was peace in my days. And I took wives of my own from every land, who were numberless. And I marched against the Jebusaeans, and there I saw Jebusaean, daughter of a man: and fell violently in love with her, and desired to take her to wife along with my other wives. And I said to their priests: \"Give me the Sonmanites (i.e. Shunammite) to wife.\" But the priests of Moloch said to me: \"If thou lovest this maiden, go in and worship our gods, the great god Raphan and the god called Moloch.\" I therefore was in fear of the glory of God, and did not follow to worship. And I said to them: \"I will not worship a strange god. What is this proposal, that ye compel me to do so much?\" But they said: \". . . by our fathers.\"",
        "1:129": "And when I answered that I would on no account worship strange gods, they told the maiden not to sleep with me until I complied and sacrificed to the gods. I then was moved, but crafty Eros brought and laid by her for me five grasshoppers, saying: \"Take these grasshoppers, and crush them together in the name of the god Moloch; and then will I sleep with you.\" And this I actually did. And at once the Spirit of God departed from me, and I became weak as well as foolish in my words. And after that I was obliged by her to build a temple of idols to Baal, and to Rapha, and to Moloch, and to the other idols.",
        "1:130": "I then, wretch that I am, followed her advice, and the glory of God quite departed from me; and my spirit was darkened, and I became the sport of idols and demons. Wherefore I wrote out this Testament, that ye who get possession of it may pity, and attend to the last things, and not to the first. So that ye may find grace for ever and ever. Amen."

        "3:9": "And whilst I was doing this, the old woman came thither with the six young men whom I had seen before, and stood behind me as I was praying, and heard me praying and confessing my sins unto the Lord.",
        "3:10": "And touching me, she said; Leave off praying now only for thy sins; pray also for righteousness, that thou mayest receive a part of it in thy house.",
        "3:11": "And she lifted me up from the place, and took me by the hand, and brought me to the seat; and said to the young men, go, and build.",
        "3:12": "As soon as they were departed, and we were alone, she said unto me; sit here. I answered her; Lady, let those who are elder sit first. She replied, Sit down as I bid you.",
        "3:13": "And when I would have sat on the right side, she suffered me not, but made a sign to me with her hand, that I should sit on the left.",
        "3:14": "As I was therefore musing, and full of sorrow, that she would not suffer me to sit on the right side, she said unto me, Hermas, why art thou sad?",
        "3:15": "The place which is on the right hand is theirs who have already attained unto God, and have suffered for his name-sake. But there is yet a great deal remaining unto thee, before thou canst sit with them.",
        "3:16": "But continue as thou doest, in thy sincerity, and thou shalt sit with them; as all others shall, who do their works, and shall bear what they have borne.",
        "3:17": "I said to her; Lady, I would know what it is that they have suffered? Hear then, said she: wild beasts, scourgings, imprisonments, and crosses for his name-sake.",
        "3:18": "For this cause the right hand of holiness belongs to them, and to all others as many as shall suffer for the name of God; but the left belongs to the rest.",
        "3:19": "Howbeit the gifts and the promises belong to both, to them on the right, and to those on the left hand; only that sitting on the right hand they have some glory above the others.",
        "3:20": "But thou art desirous to sit on the right hand with them, and yet thy defects are many. But thou shalt be purged from thy defects, as also all who doubt not shall be cleansed from all the sins which they have committed unto this day.",
        "3:21": "And when she had said this she would have departed.",
        "3:22": "Wherefore, falling down before her feet, I began to entreat her, for the Lord's sake, that she would show me the vision which she had promised.",
        "3:23": "Then she again took me by the hand, and lifted me up, and made me sit upon the seat at the left side; and holding up a certain bright wand, said unto me, Seest thou that great thing? I replied, Lady, I see nothing.",
        "3:24": "She answered, Dost thou not see over against thee a great tower, which is built upon the water with bright square stones?",
        "3:25": "For the tower was built upon a square by these six young men that came with her.",
        "3:26": "But many thousand of other men brought stones; some drew them out of the deep, others carried them from the ground, and gave them to the six young men; and they took them and built.",
        "3:27": "As for those stones which were drawn out of the deep, they put them all into the building; for they were polished, and their squares exactly answered one another, and so one was joined in such wise to the other, that there was no space to be seen where they joined, insomuch that the whole tower appeared to be built as it were of one stone.",
        "3:28": "But as for the other stones that were taken off from the ground, some of them they rejected, others they fitted into the building.",
        "3:29": "As for those which were rejected, some they cut out, and cast them at a distance from the tower; but many others of them lay round about the tower, which they made no use of in the building.",
        "3:30": "For some of these were rough, others had clefts in them, others were white and round, not proper for the building of the tower.",
        "3:31": "But I saw the other stones cast afar off from the tower, and falling into the high-way, and yet not continuing in the way, but were rolled from the way into a desert place.",
        "3:32": "Others I saw falling into the fire and burning; others fell near the water, yet could not roll themselves into it, though very desirous to fall into the water.",
        "3:33": "And when she had showed me these things she would have departed; but I said to her, Lady, what doth it profit me to see these things, and not understand what they mean?",
        "3:34": "She answered and said unto me; You are very cunning, in that you are desirous to know those things which relate to the tower. Yea, said I, lady, that I may declare them unto the brethren, and they may rejoice, and hearing these things may glorify God with great glory.",
        "3:35": "Then she said, Many indeed shall hear them, and when they shall have heard them, some shall rejoice, and others weep. And yet even these, if they shall repent, shall rejoice too.",
        "3:36": "Hear therefore what I shall say concerning the parable of the tower, and after this be no longer importunate with me about the revelation.",
        "3:37": "For these revelations have an end, seeing they are fulfilled. But thou dost not leave off to desire revelations, for thou art very urgent.",
        "3:38": "As for the tower which thou seest built, it is myself, namely, the church, which have appeared to thee both now and heretofore. Wherefore ask what thou wilt concerning the tower, and I will reveal it unto thee, that thou mayest rejoice with the saints.",
        "3:39": "I said unto her, Lady, because thou hast thought me once worthy to receive from thee the revelation of all these things, declare them unto me.",
        "3:40": "She answered me, Whatsoever is fit to be revealed unto thee shall be revealed: only yet thy heart be with the Lord, and doubt not, whatsoever thou shalt see.",
        "3:41": "I asked her, Lady, why is the tower built upon the water? She replied, I said before to thee that thou wert very wise to inquire diligently concerning the building, therefore thou shalt find the truth.",
        "3:42": "Hear therefore why the tower is built upon the water: because your life is and shall be saved by water. For it is founded by the word of the almighty and honourable name, and is supported by the invisible power and virtue of God.",
        "3:43": "And I answering, said unto her, These things are very admirable; but, lady, who are those six young men that build?",
        "3:44": "They are, said she, the angels of God, who were first appointed, and to whom the Lord has delivered all his creatures, to frame and build them up, and to rule over them. For by these the building of the tower shall be finished.",
        "3:45": "And who are the rest who bring them stones?",
        "3:46": "They also are the holy angels of the Lord; but the others are more excellent than these. Wherefore when the whole building of the tower shall be finished, they shall all feast together beside the tower, and shall glorify God, because the structure of the tower is finished.",
        "3:47": "I asked her, saying, I would know the condition of the stones, and what the meaning of them is?",
        "3:48": "She answering, said unto me, Art thou better than all others that this should be revealed unto thee? For others are both before thee and better than thou art, to whom these visions should be made manifest.",
        "3:49": "Nevertheless, that the name of God may be glorified, it has been shown and shall be revealed unto thee, for the sake of those who are doubtful, and think in their hearts whether these things are so or not.",
        "3:50": "Tell them that all these things are true, and that there is nothing in them that is not true but all are firm and truly established.",
        "3:51": "Hear now then concerning the stones that are in the building.",
        "3:52": "The square and white stones which agree exactly in their joints, are the apostles, and bishops, and doctors, and ministers, who through the mercy of God have come in, and governed, and taught and ministered holily and modestly to the elect of God, both they that have fallen asleep, and which yet remain; and have always agreed with them, and have had peace within themselves, and have heard each other.",
        "3:53": "For which cause their joints exactly meet together in the building of the tower.",
        "3:54": "They which are drawn out of the deep and put into the building, and whose joints agree with the other stones which are already built, are those which are already fallen asleep, and have suffered for the sake of the Lord's name.",
        "3:55": "And what are the other stones, lady, that are brought from the earth? I would know what are they.",
        "3:56": "She answered, They which lie upon the ground and are not polished, are those which God has approved, because they have walked in I the law of the Lord, and directed their ways in his commandments.",
        "3:57": "They which are brought and put in the building of the tower, are the young in faith and the faithful. And these are admonished by the angels to do well because iniquity is not found in them.",
        "3:58": "But who are those whom they rejected, and laid beside the tower?",
        "3:59": "They are such as have sinned and are willing to repent; for which cause they are not cast far from the tower, because they will be useful for the building, if they shall repent.",
        "3:60": "They therefore that are yet to repent, if they repent they shall become strong in the faith; that is, if they repent now, whilst the tower is building. For if the building shall be finished there will then be no place for them to be put in, but they shall be rejected; for he only has this privilege who shall now be put into the tower.",
        "3:61": "But would you know who they are that were cut out, and cast afar off from the tower? Lady said I, I desire it.",
        "3:62": "They are the children of iniquity, who believed only in hypocrisy, and departed not from their evil ways; for this cause they shall not be saved, because they are not of any use in the building by reason of their sins.",
        "3:63": "Wherefore they are cut out, and cast afar off, because of the anger of the Lord, and because they have provoked him to anger against them.",
        "3:64": "As for the great number of other stones which thou hast seen placed about the tower, but now put into the building; those which are rugged, are they who have known the truth, but have not continued in it, nor been joined to the saints, and therefore are unprofitable.",
        "3:65": "Those that have clefts in them, are they that keep up discord in their hearts against each other, and live not in peace; that are friendly when present with their brethren, but as soon as they are departed from one another, their wickedness still continues in their hearts: these are the clefts which are seen in those stones.",
        "3:66": "Those that are maimed and short, are they who have believed indeed, but still are in great measure full of wickedness; for this cause they are maimed and not whole.",
        "3:67": "But what are the white and round stones, lady, and which are not proper for the building of the tower?",
        "3:68": "She answering said unto me: How long wilt thou continue foolish and without understanding, asking everything and discerning nothing?",
        "3:69": "They are such as have faith indeed, but have withal the riches of this present world. When therefore any troubles arise, for the sake of their riches and traffic, they deny the Lord.",
        "3:70": "I answering, said unto her, When therefore will they be profitable to the Lord? When their riches shall be cut away, says she, in which they take delight, then they will be profitable unto the Lord for his building.",
        "3:71": "For as a round stone, unless it be cut away and is cast somewhat of its bulk, cannot be made square, so they who are rich in this world; unless their riches be pared off; cannot be made profitable unto the Lord.",
        "3:72": "Learn this from thy own experience: when thou wert rich, thou wast unprofitable; but now thou art profitable, and fit for the life which thou hast undertaken; for thou also once was one of those stones.",
        "3:73": "As for the rest of the stones which thou sawest cast afar off from the tower, and running in the way, and tumbled out of the way into desert places; they are such as have believed indeed, but through their doubting have forsaken the true way, thinking that they could find a better. But they wander and are miserable, going into desolate ways.",
        "3:74": "Then for those stones which fell into the fire and were burnt, they are those who have for ever departed from the living God; nor doth it ever come into their hearts to repent, by reason of the affection which they bear to their lusts and wickedness which they commit.",
        "3:75": "And what are the rest which fell by the water, and could not roll into the water?",
        "3:76": "They are such as have heard the word, and were willing to be baptised in the name of the Lord; but considering the great holiness which the truth requires, have withdrawn themselves, an walked again after wicked lusts.",
        "3:77": "Thus she finished the explanation of the tower.",
        "3:78": "But I being still urgent, asked her, Is there repentance allowed to all those stones which are thus cast away, and were not suitable to the building of the tower; and shall they find place in this tower?",
        "3:79": "They may repent, said she, yet they cannot come into this tower; but, they shall be placed in a much lower rank, and then only after they shall have been afflicted and fulfilled the days of their sins.",
        "3:80": "And for this cause they shall be removed, because they have received the word of righteousness: and then they shall be translated from their afflictions, if they shall have a true sense in their hearts of what they have done amiss.",
        "3:81": "But if they shall not have this sense in their hearts, they shall not be saved by reason of the hardness of their hearts.",
        "3:82": "When therefore I had done asking her concerning all these things, she said unto me, Wilt thou see something else? And being desirous of seeing it, I became very cheerful of countenances.",
        "3:83": "She therefore looking back upon me, and smiling a little, said unto me, Seest thou seven women about the tower? Lady, said I, I see them.",
        "3:84": "This tower, replied she, is supported by them, according to the command of the Lord: hear therefore the effects of them.",
        "3:85": "The first of them, which holds fast with her hand, is called Faith; The next, which is girt up, and looks manly, is named Abstinence: she is the daughter of Faith.",
        "3:86": "Whosoever therefore shall follow her shall be happy in all his life, because he shall abstain from all evil works, believing that if he shall contain himself from all concupiscence, he shall be the heir of eternal life. And what, lady, said I, are the other five?",
        "3:87": "They are, replied she, the daughters of one another. The first of them is called Simplicity; the next Innocence; the third Modesty; then Discipline; and the last of all is Charity. When therefore thou shalt have fulfilled the works of their mother, thou shalt be able to do all things.",
        "3:88": "Lady, said I, I would know what particular virtue every one of these has.",
        "3:89": "Hear then, replied she; they have equal virtues, and their virtues are knit together, and follow one another as they were born.",
        "3:90": "From Faith proceeds Abstinence; from Abstinence, Simplicity; from Simplicity, Innocence; from Innocence, Modesty; from Modesty, Discipline and Charity. Therefore the works of these are holy, and chaste, and right.",
        "3:91": "Whoever therefore shall serve these, and hold fast to their works, he shall have his dwelling in the tower with the saints of God.",
        "3:92": "Then I asked her concerning the times, whether the end were now at hand?",
        "3:93": "But she cried out with a loud voice, saying, O foolish man! Dost thou not see the tower yet a building? When therefore the tower shall be finished, and built, it shall have an end; and indeed it shall soon be accomplished.",
        "3:94": "But do not ask me any more questions. What has been said may suffice thee and all the saints for the refreshment of your spirits. For these things have not been revealed to thee only, but that thou mayest make them manifest unto all.",
        "3:95": "For therefore, O Hermas, after three days thou must understand these words which I begin to speak unto thee, that thou mayest speak them in the ears of the saints; that when thou shall have heard and done them, they may be cleansed from their iniquities, and thou together with them.",
        "3:96": "Hear me therefore, O my sons! I have bred you up in much simplicity, and innocency, and modesty, for the love of God, which has dropped down upon you in righteousness, that you should be sanctified and justified from all sin and wickedness; but ye will not cease from your evil doings.",
        "3:97": "Now therefore hearken unto me, and have peace one with another, and visit one another, and receive one another, and do not enjoy the creatures of God alone.",
        "3:98": "Give freely to them that are in need. For some by too free feeding contract an infirmity in their flesh, and do injury to their bodies; whilst the flesh of others, who have not food, withers away, because they want sufficient nourishment, and the bodies are consumed.",
        "3:99": "Wherefore this intemperance is hurtful to you, who have, and do not contribute to them that want. Prepare for the judgment that is about to come upon you.",
        "3:100": "Ye that are the more eminent, search out them that are hungry, whilst the tower is yet unfinished. For when the tower shall be finished, ye shall be willing to do good, and shall not find any place in it.",
        "3:101": "Beware, therefore, ye that glory in your riches, lest perhaps they groan who are in want, and their sighing come up unto God, and ye be shut out with your goods without the gate of the tower.",
        "3:102": "Behold I now warn you who are set over the church, and love the highest seats, be not ye like unto those that work mischief.",
        "3:103": "And they indeed carry about their poison in boxes, but ye contain your poison and infection in your hearts, and will not purge them, and mix your sense with a pure heart, that ye might find mercy with the Great King.",
        "3:104": "Take heed, my children, that your dissensions deprive you not of your lives. How will ye instruct the elect of God, when ye yourselves want correction? Wherefore admonish one another, and be at peace among yourselves, that I, standing before your Father, may give an account of you unto the Lord.",
        "3:105": "And when she had made an end of talking with me, the six young men that built, came and carried her to the tower; and four others took up the seat on which she sat, and they also went away again to the tower. I saw not the faces of these, for their backs were towards me.",
        "3:106": "As she was going away, I asked her, that she would reveal to me what concerned the three forms, in which she had appeared unto me.",
        "3:107": "But she answering said unto me, concerning these things thou must ask some other, that they may be revealed unto thee.",
        "3:108": "Now, brethren, in the first vision the last year, she appeared unto me exceedingly old, and sitting in a chair.",
        "3:109": "In another vision, she had indeed a youthful face, but her flesh and hair were old; but she talked with me standing, and was more cheerful than the first time.",
        "3:110": "In the third vision, she was in all respects much younger, and comely to the eye; only she had the hair of an aged person: yet she looked cheerful, and sat upon a seat.",
        "3:111": "I was therefore very sad concerning these things, until I might understand the vision.",
        "3:112": "Wherefore I saw the same old woman in a vision of the night saying unto me, All prayer needeth humiliation. Fast, therefore, and thou shalt learn from the Lord that which thou dost ask. I fasted therefore one day.",
        "3:113": "The same night a young man appeared to me and said, Why dost thou thus often desire Revelations in thy prayers? Take heed that by asking many things, thou hurt not the body. Let these Revelations suffice thee.",
        "3:114": "Canst thou see more notable Revelations than those which thou hast already received?",
        "3:115": "I answered and said unto him, Sir, I only ask this one thing upon the account of the three figures of the old woman that appeared to me, that the Revelation may be complete.",
        "3:116": "He answered me, You are not without understanding, but your doubts make you so; for as much as you have not your heart with the Lord.",
        "3:117": "I replied and said, But we shall learn these things more carefully from you.",
        "3:118": "Hear then, says he, concerning the figures about which you inquire.",
        "3:119": "To begin; in the first vision she appeared to thee in the shape of an old woman sitting in, a chair, because your old spirit was decayed, and without strength, by reason of your infirmities, and the doubtfulness of your heart.",
        "3:120": "For as they who are old have no hope of renewing themselves, nor expect any thing but their departure; so you being weakened through your worldly affairs gave yourself up to sloth, and cast not away your solicitude from yourself upon the Lord: and your sense was confused, and you grew old in your sadness.",
        "3:121": "But, sir, I would know why she sat upon a chair?",
        "3:122": "He answered, because every one that is weak sitteth upon a chair by reason of his infirmity, that his weakness may be upheld. Behold therefore the figure of the first vision.",
        "3:123": "In the second vision you saw her standing, and having a youthful face, and more cheerful than her former; but her flesh and her hair were ancient. Hear, said he, this parable also.",
        "3:124": "When any one grows old, he despairs of himself by reason of his infirmity and poverty, and expects nothing but the last day of his life.",
        "3:125": "But on a sudden an inheritance is left to him, and he hears of it, and rises: and being become cheerful, be puts on new strength. And now he no longer sits down, but stands, and is delivered from his former sorrow; and sits not, but acts manfully.",
        "3:126": "So you, having heard the Revelation which God revealed unto you, because God had compassion upon you, and renewed your spirit, both laid aside your infirmities, and strength came to you, and you grew strong in the faith; and God, seeing your strength, rejoiced.",
        "3:127": "For this cause he showed you the building of the tower, and will show other things unto you, if you shall have peace with all your heart among each other.",
        "3:128": "But in the third vision you saw her yet younger, fair and cheerful, and of a serene countenance.",
        "3:129": "For, as if some good news comes to him that is sad, he straightway forgets his sadness, and regards nothing else but the good news which he has heard; and for the rest he is comforted, and his spirit is renewed through the joy which he has received even so you have been refreshed in your spirit by seeing these good things.",
        "3:130": "And for that you saw her sitting upon a bench, it denotes a strong position; because a bench has four feet, and stands strongly. And even the world itself is upheld by the four elements.",
        "3:131": "They therefore that repent perfectly, shall be young; and they that turn from their sins with their whole heart, shall be established.",
        "3:132": "And now you have the Revelation fully, ask no more to have any thing farther revealed unto you.",
        "3:133": "But if any thing is to be revealed, it shall be made manifest unto you.",
        "4:1": "Saw a vision brethren, twenty days after the former vision; a representation of the tribulation that is at hand. I was walking in the field way.",
        "4:2": "Now from the public way to the place whither I went is about ten furlongs; it is a way very little frequented:",
        "4:3": "And as I was walking alone, I entreated the Lord that he would confirm the Revelations which he had shown unto me by his Holy Church.",
        "4:4": "And would grant repentance to all his servants who had been offended, that his great and honourable name might be glorified, and because he thought me worthy to whom he might show his wonders, and, that I might honour him, and give thanks unto him.",
        "4:5": "And behold somewhat like a voice answered me; Doubt not, Hermas. Wherefore I began to think, and say within myself, why should I doubt, seeing I am thus settled by the Lord, and have seen such glorious things?",
        "4:6": "I had gone but a little farther, brethren, when behold I saw a dust rise up to heaven. I began to say within myself, is there a drove of cattle coming, that rises such a dust?",
        "4:7": "It was about a furlong off from me. And behold I saw the dust rise more and more, insomuch that I began to suspect that there was somewhat extraordinary in it.",
        "4:8": "And the sun shone a little; and behold I saw a great beast, as it were a whale; and fiery locusts came out of his mouth. The height of the beast was about a hundred feet, and he had a head like a large earthen vessel.",
        "4:9": "I began to weep, and to pray unto the Lord that he would deliver me from it. Then I called to mind the word which I had heard; Doubt not, Hermas.",
        "4:10": "Wherefore, brethren, putting on a divine faith, and remembering who it was that had taught me great things, I delivered myself bodily unto the beast.",
        "4:11": "Now the beast came on in such a manner, as if it could at once have devoured a city.",
        "4:12": "I came near unto it, and the beast extended its whole bulk upon the ground, and put forth nothing but its tongue, nor once moved itself till I had quite passed by it.",
        "4:13": "Now the beast had upon its head four colours; first black, then a red and bloody colour, then a golden, and then a white.",
        "4:14": "After that I had passed by it, and was gone forward about thirty feet, behold there met me a certain virgin, well adorned as if she had been just come out of her bride-chamber; all in white, having on white shoes, and a veil down her face, and covered with shining hair.",
        "4:15": "Now I knew by my former visions that it was the church, and thereupon grew the more cheerful. She saluted me, saying, Hail, O Man! I returned the salutation, saying, Lady, Hail!",
        "4:16": "She answering said unto me, Did nothing meet you, O man! I replied, Lady, there met me such a beast, as seemed able to devour a whole people; but by the power of God, and through his singular mercy, I escaped it.",
        "4:17": "Thou didst escape it well, said she, because thou didst cast thy whole care upon God, and opened thy heart unto him, believing that thou couldst be safe by no other than by his great and honourable name.",
        "4:18": "For this cause the Lord sent his angel, who is over the beast, whose name is Hegrin, and stopped his mouth, that he should not devour thee, Thou hast escaped a great trial through thy faith, and because thou didst not doubt for such a terrible beast.",
        "4:19": "Go, therefore, and relate to the elect of God the great things that he hath done for thee. And thou shalt say unto them, that this beast is the figure of the trial that is about to come.",
        "4:20": "If, therefore, ye shall have prepared yourselves, ye may escape it, if your hearts be pure and without spot; and if ye shall serve God all the rest of your days without complaint.",
        "4:21": "Cast all your care upon the Lord, and he will direct them. Believe in God, ye doubtful, because he can do all things; he can both turn away his wrath from you, and send you help and security.",
        "4:22": "Woe to the doubtful, to those who shall hear these words, and shall despise them: it had been better for them that they had not been born.",
        "4:23": "Then I asked her concerning the four colours which the beast had upon its head. But she answered me saying; Again thou art curious in that thou asketh concerning these things. But I said to her, Lady, chew me what they are?",
        "4:24": "Hear, said she; The black which thou sawest denotes the world in which you dwell. The fiery and bloody colour signifies that this age must be destroyed by fire and blood.",
        "4:25": "The golden part are ye, who have escaped out of it; for as gold is tried by the fire, and is made profitable, so are ye also in like manner tried who dwell among the men of this world.",
        "4:26": "They therefore, that shall endure to the end, and be proved by them, shall be purged. And as gold, by this trial, is cleansed and loses its dross, so shall ye also cast away all sorrow and trouble, and be made pure for the building of the tower.",
        "4:27": "But the white colour denotes the time of the world which is to come, in which the elect of God shall dwell: because the elect of God shall be pure and without spot until life eternal.",
        "4:28": "Wherefore do not thou cease to speak these thing in the ears of the saints. Here ye have the figure of the great tribulation that is about to come; which, if you please, shall be nothing to you.",
        "4:29": "When she had spoken thus much, she departed; but I saw not whither she went. But suddenly I heard a noise, and I turned back, being afraid, for I thought that the beast was coming toward me."

        "1:1": "Beloved, let us prefer nothing in honor except sincere love: for in many things we stumble every day and night and hour. And for this cause let us gain love, for it covereth a multitude of sins: for what is the profit, my children, if we have all things, and have not saving love… O blessed love, supplier of all good things. Blessed is the man who has gained the true faith and sincere love, according as the Master said, there is no greater love than this that a man should lay down his life for his friend.",
        "1:2": "And invisibly he received a voice in his ears: Come hither, Sedrach, since thou wishest and desirest to converse with God and ask of him that he may reveal unto thee whatever thou wishest to ask. And Sedrach said: What, Sir? And the voice said to him: I was sent to thee to raise thee here into heaven. And he said: I desired to speak mouth to mouth with God: I am not fit, Sir, to come into heaven. And stretching out his wings he took him up and he came into heaven to the very flame, and he set him as high as the third heaven, and in it stood the flame of the divinity.",
        "1:3": "And the Lord saith to him: Welcome, my beloved Sedrach: What suit hast thou against God who created thee, that thou saidst, I desired to speak face to face with God? Sedrach saith to him: Yea, verily, the son hath a suit with the Father: my Lord, why didst thou make the earth? The Lord saith to him: For man’s sake. Sedrach saith: And why didst Thou make the sea? Why didst Thou scatter every good thing on the earth? The Lord saith to him: For man’s sake. Sedrach saith to him: If thou didst these things, why wilt Thou destroy him? And the Lord said: Man is my work and the creature of my hands, and I discipline him as I find good.",
        "1:4": "Sedrach saith to him: Chastisement and fire are thy discipline: they are bitter, my Lord: it were well for man if he had not been born: why then didst thou make him, my Lord? Why didst thou weary thine undefiled hands and create man, since thou didst not intend to have mercy on him? God saith to him: I made Adam the first creature and placed him in Paradise in the midst of the tree of life and said to him: Eat of all the fruits, but beware of the tree of life: for if thou eat of it, thou shalt die the death. But he transgressed my commandment, and being beguiled by the devil ate of the tree.",
        "1:5": "Sedrach saith to him: Of thy will Adam was beguiled, my Lord: Thou commandest thine angels to make approach to Adam, and the first of the angels himself transgressed thy commandment and did not make approach to him, and Thou didst banish him, because he transgressed thy commandment and did not make any approach to the work of thine hands: if thou lovedst man, why didst Thou not slay the devil, the worker of unrighteousness? Who is able to fight an invisible spirit? And he as a smoke enters into the hearts of men and teaches them every sin: he fights against thee, the immortal God, and what can wretched man then do to him? But have mercy, O Lord, and stop the chastisements: but if not, count me also with the sinners: if thou wilt have no mercy on the sinners, where are thy mercies, where is thy compassion, O Lord?",
        "1:6": "God saith to him: Be it known unto thee that I ordered all things to be placable to him: I gave him understanding and made him the heir of heaven and earth, and I subjected all things to him, and every living thing flees from him and from before his face: but he, having received of mine, became alien, adulterous, and sinful: tell me, what father, having given his son his portion, when he takes his substance and leaves his father and goes away and becomes an alien and serves an alien, when the father sees that the son has deserted him, does not darken his heart, and does not the father go and take his substance and banish him from his glory because he deserted his father? And how have I, the wonderful and jealous God, given him everything, and he having received these things has become an adulterer and a sinner?",
        "1:7": "Sedrach saith to him: Thou, O Lord, didst create man. Thou knewest of what sort of mind he was and of what sort of knowledge we are, and thou makest it a cause for chastisement: but cast him forth; for shall not I alone fill up the heavenly places? But if that is not to be so save man too, O Lord. He failed by thy will, wretched man. Why dost thou waste words on me, Sedrach? I created Adam and his wife and the sun and said: Behold each other how bright he is, and the wife of Adam is brighter in the beauty of the moon and he was the giver of her life. Sedrach saith: but of what profit are beauties if they die away into the earth? How didst thou say, O Lord, Thou shalt not return evil for evil? How is it, O Lord? the word of Thy divinity never lies, and why dost Thou retaliate on man? or dost thou not in so doing render evil for evil? I know that among the quadrupeds there is no other so wily and unreasonable as the mule. But we strike it with the bridle when we wish: and thou hast angels: send them forth to guard them, and when man inclines towards sin, to take hold of his foot and not let him go whither he would.",
        "1:8": "God saith to him: If I catch him by the foot, he will say, Thou hast given me no joy in the world. But I have left him to his own will because I loved him. Wherefore I sent forth my righteous angels to guard him night and day. Sedrach saith: I know, O Lord, that of all thy creatures Thou chiefly lovedst man, of the quadrupeds the sheep, of woods the olive, of fruits the vine, of flying things the bee, of rivers the Jordan, of cities Jerusalem. And all these man also loves, my Lord. God saith to Sedrach: I will ask thee one thing, Sedrach: if thou answerest me, then I may fitly help thee, even though thou hast tempted thy creator. Sedrach saith: Speak. The Lord God saith: Since I made all things, how many men were born and how many died, and how many are to die and how many hairs have they? Tell me, Sedrach, since the heaven was created and the earth, how many trees grew in the world, and how many fell, and how many are to fall, and how many are to arise, and how many leaves have they? Tell me, Sedrach, since I made the sea, how many waves arose and how many fell, and how many are to arise, and how many winds blow along the margin of the sea? Tell me, Sedrach, from the creation of the world of the æons, when the air rained, how many drops fell upon the world, and how many are to fall? And Sedrach said: Thou alone knowest all these things, O Lord; thou only understandest all these things: only, I pray thee, deliver man from chastisement, and I shall not be separated from our race.",
        "1:9": "And God said to his only begotten Son: Go, take the soul of Sedrach my beloved, and place it in Paradise. The only begotten Son saith to Sedrach: Give me the trust which our Father deposited in the womb of thy mother in the holy tabernacle of thy body from a child. Sedrach saith: I will not give thee my soul. God saith to him: And wherefore was I sent to come hither, and thou pleadest against me? For I was commanded by my Father not to take thy soul with violence; but if not, (then) give me thy most greatly desired soul.",
        "1:10": "And Sedrach saith to God: And whence dost Thou intend to take my soul, and from which limb? And God saith to him: Dost thou not know that it is placed in the midst of thy lungs and thy heart and is dispersed into all thy limbs? It is brought up through the throat and gullet and the mouth and at whatever hour it is predestined to come forth, it is scattered, and brought together from the points of the nails and from all the limbs, and there is a great necessity that it should be separated from the body and parted from the heart. When Sedrach had heard all these things and had considered the memory of death he was greatly astounded, and Sedrach said to God: O Lord, give me a little respite that I may weep, for I have heard that tears are able to do much and much remedy comes to the lowly body of thy creature.",
        "1:11": "And weeping and bewailing he began to say: O marvellous head of heavenly adornment: O radiant as the sun which shines on heaven and earth: thy hairs are known from Teman, thine eyes from Bosor, thine ears from thunder, thy tongue from a trumpet, and thy brain is a small creation, thy head the energy of the whole body: O friendly and most fair beloved by all, and now falling into the earth it must become forgotten. O hands, mild, fair-fingered, worn with toil by which the body is nourished: O hands, deftest of all, heaping up from all quarters ye made ready houses. O fingers adorned and decked with gold and silver (rings): and great worlds are led by the fingers: the three joints enfold the palms, and heap up beautiful things: and now ye must become aliens to the world. O feet, skilfully walking about, self-running, most swift, unconquerable: O knees, fitted together, because without you the body does not move: the feet run along with the sun and the moon in the night and in the day, heaping up all things, foods and drinks, and nourishing the body: O feet, most swift and fair runners, moving on the face of the earth, getting ready the house with every good thing: O feet which bear up the whole body, that run up to the temples, making repentance and calling on the saints, and now ye are to remain motionless. O head and hands and feet, until now I have kept you. O soul, what sent thee into the humble and wretched body? and now being separated from it, thou art going up where the Lord calleth thee, and the wretched body goes away to judgment. O body well-adorned, hair clothed with stars, head of heavenly adornment and dress: O face well-anointed, light-bringing eyes, voice trumpet-like, tongue placable, chin fairly adorned, hairs like the stars, head high as heaven, body decked out, light-bringing eyes that know all things—and now you shall fall into the earth and under the earth your beauty shall disappear.",
        "1:12": "Christ saith to him: Stay, Sedrach; how long dost thou weep and groan? Paradise is opened to thee, and, dying, thou shalt live. Sedrach saith to him: Once more I will speak unto thee, O Lord: How long shall I live before I die? and do not disregard my prayer. The Lord saith to him: Speak, O Sedrach. Sedrach saith: If a man shall live eighty or ninety or an hundred years, and live these years in sin, and again shall turn, and the man live in repentance, in how many days dost thou forgive him his sins? God saith to him: If he shall live an hundred or eighty years and shall turn and repent for three years and do the fruit of righteousness, and death shall overtake him, I will not remember all his sins.",
        "1:13": "Sedrach saith to him: The three years are a long time, my Lord, lest death overtake him and he fulfill not his repentance: have mercy, Lord, on thine image and have compassion, for the three years are many. God saith to him: If a man live an hundred years and remember his death and confess before men and I find him, after a time I will forgive all his sins. Sedrach saith again: I will again beseech thy compassion for thy creature. The time is long lest death overtake him and snatch him suddenly. The Saviour saith to him: I will ask thee one word, Sedrach, my beloved, then thou shalt ask me in turn: if the man shall repent for forty days I will not remember all his sins which he did.",
        "1:15": "And Sedrach saith to the archangel Michael: Hearken to me, O powerful chief, and help thou me and be my envoy that God may have mercy on the world. And falling on their faces, they besought the Lord and said: O Lord, teach us how and by what sort of repentance and by what labour man shall be saved. God saith: By repentances, by intercessions, by liturgies, by tears in streams, in hot groanings. Dost thou not know that my prophet David was saved by tears, and the rest were saved in one moment? Thou knowest, Sedrach, that there are nations which have not the law and which do the works of the law: for if they are unbaptized and my divine spirit come unto them and they turn to my baptism, I also receive them with my righteous ones into Abraham’s bosom. And there are some who have been baptized with my baptism and who have shared in my divine part and become reprobate in complete reprobation and will not repent: and I suffer them with much compassion and much pity and wealth in order that they may repent, but they do the things which my divinity hates, and did not hearken to the wise man asking (them), saying, we by no means justify a sinner. Dost thou not most certainly know that it is written: And those who repent never see chastisement? And they did not hearken to the Apostles or to my word in the Gospels, and they grieve my angels, and verily they do not attend to my messenger in the assemblies (for communion) and in my services, and they do not stand in my holy churches, but they stand and do not fall down and worship in fear and trembling, but boast things which I do not accept, or my holy angels.",
        "1:16": "Sedrach saith to God: O Lord, Thou alone art sinless and very compassionate, having compassion and pity for sinners, but thy divinity said: I am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance. And the Lord said to Sedrach: Dost thou not know, Sedrach, that the thief was saved in one moment to repent? Dost thou not know that my apostle and evangelist was saved in one moment? “Peccatores enim non salvantur,” for their hearts are like rotten stone: these are they who walk in impious ways and who shall be destroyed with Antichrist. Sedrach saith: O my Lord, Thou also saidst: My divine spirit entered into the nations which, not having the law, do the things of the law. So also the thief and the apostle and evangelist and the rest of those who have already got into thy Kingdom. O my Lord; so likewise do Thou pardon those who have sinned to the last: for life is very toilsome and there is no time for repentance.",
        "1:17": "The Lord saith to Sedrach: I made man in three stages: when he is young, I overlooked his stumblings as he was young: and again when he was a man I considered his purpose: and again when he grows old, I watch him till he repent. Sedrach saith: O Lord, Thou knowest and understandest all these things: but have sympathy for sinners. The Lord saith to him: Sedrach, my beloved, I promise to have sympathy and bring down the forty days to twenty: and whosoever shall remember thy name shall not see the place of chastisement, but shall be with the just in a place of refreshment and rest: and if anyone shall record this wonderful word his sins shall not be reckoned against him for ever and ever. And Sedrach saith: O Lord, and if anyone shall bring enlightenment to thy servant, save him, O Lord, from all evil. And Sedrach, the servant of the Lord, saith: Now take my soul, O Lord. And God took him and placed him in Paradise with all the saints. To whom be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen."
